Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for treating fluid accumulation in the macula after cataract surgery Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is the accumulation of fluid in the macula (central retina) due to leakage from capillaries.
Clinically significant CMO following cataract surgery is a complication of unknown cause.
Acute CMO, defined as oedema of less than four months duration, often gets better spontaneously.
This review included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 266 participants.
Four trials studied the effects of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) in chronic CMO while the other three examined the effect of NSAIDs in acute CMO.
This review found two trials which showed that topical NSAID (0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution) has a positive effect on chronic CMO and a third trial which was supportive of this finding (albeit not statistically significantly so).
One study suggested no effect and our review suggests further work is needed for a more conclusive decision regarding use of NSAIDS in chronic CMO.
Similarly, the effects of NSAIDs in acute CMO remain unclear and this too needs further investigation.
