Cordyceps sinensis (a Chinese medicinal herb) for treating chronic kidney disease People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience gradual worsening of kidney function.
Cordyceps ( Cordyceps sinensis ), which is sometimes known as Chinese caterpillar fungus, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat people with CKD.
We conducted this review to investigate if Cordyceps was a safe and effective treatment for people with CKD.
We searched the literature published up to April 2014 and assessed evidence from 22 studies conducted in China that involved 1746 people with CKD who received Cordyceps as part of their treatment.
We found some evidence to indicate that Cordyceps preparations given in addition to conventional Western medicine may be beneficial in improving kidney function and addressing some complications.
However, evidence quality was poor, and no definitive conclusions could be made about Cordyceps for people with CKD.
