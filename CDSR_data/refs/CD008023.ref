Drugs for treatment of urinary retention after surgery in adults An inability to empty the bladder following surgery is a relatively common complication.
Usually, the problem is addressed by use of a catheter, a thin tube passed into the bladder to allow urine to empty.
If drugs could be identified that help patients to empty their bladders, this would reduce the need for catheterisation, which can be uncomfortable and can result in complications.
This review looked for studies that had considered the effectiveness of drugs used to help patients to empty their bladder after surgery.
Few studies were found.
There is some evidence that introducing an agent called prostaglandin into the bladder can help patients to regain the ability to empty their bladders.
There is weaker evidence that drugs called cholinergics, combined with a sedative, can also help.
There is a need for more research in this area.
