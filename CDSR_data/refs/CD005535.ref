Long‐acting beta2‐agonists versus placebo in addition to inhaled corticosteroids in children and adults with chronic asthma The use of long‐acting ß 2 ‐agonists (LABAs) as 'add‐on' medication to inhaled corticosteroids is recommended for poorly‐controlled asthma where asthma exacerbations may require additional treatment with oral steroids.
The purpose of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding long‐acting ß 2 ‐agonists to inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children and adults.
Based on the identified randomised trials, in people who remain symptomatic while on inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of long‐acting ß 2 ‐agonists improves lung function and reduces the risk of asthma exacerbations compared to ongoing treatment with a similar dose of inhaled corticosteroids alone in adults.
We could not find evidence of increased serious adverse events or withdrawal rates due to adverse health events with the combination of long‐acting ß2‐agonists at usual doses and inhaled corticosteroids in adults.
This provides some indirect evidence, but not total reassurance, regarding the short‐ and medium‐term safety of this treatment strategy.
There have not been enough children studied to assess the risks and benefits of adding LABAs in this age group.
