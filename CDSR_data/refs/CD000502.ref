Kinesthetic stimulation versus theophylline for apnea in preterm infants There is some evidence that theophylline may be more effective for apnea in preterm babies than kinesthetic stimulation, but more research is needed.
Apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds.
It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks).
Immaturity alone can cause apnea, but so can infections.
Apnea may be harmful to the developing brain or organs if it continues.
Various methods have been tried to reduce apnea in premature babies including drugs, physical stimulation by nurses and kinesthetic stimulation (using an oscillating mattress which moves from side to side).
The review of trials found some evidence that the drug theophylline may be more effective than kinesthetic stimulation for apnea but more research is needed.
