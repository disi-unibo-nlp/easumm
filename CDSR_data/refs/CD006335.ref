Chinese herbal medicine Huangqi type formulations for nephrotic syndrome Heavy proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypoalbuminaemia (low blood albumin levels), oedema (a build‚Äêup of fluid, resulting in swelling) and hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol) are the major characteristics of nephrotic syndrome.
At present, the primary drugs for nephrotic syndrome are corticosteroids, alkylating agents and cyclosporin.
However there are many adverse effects associated with their use.
This review identified nine studies (461 participants) comparing Huangqi type formulations with control drugs.
The results of this review suggest that Huangqi type formulations may have a positive effect on nephrotic syndrome by increasing plasma albumin and reducing urine albumin excretion, blood cholesterol and triglycerides.
Huangqi type formulation may reduce some adverse effects of other drugs used for treating nephrotic syndrome, however these were only reported in two studies.
The methodological quality of the nine included studies was poor and was the major limitation of this review.
The types of pathology, sex and age of the patients, as well as the duration and dosage of the Huangqi type formulations could not be analysed.
