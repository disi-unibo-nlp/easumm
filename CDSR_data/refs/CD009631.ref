Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents for preventing central venous haemodialysis catheter malfunction in patients with end‐stage kidney disease Background Patients with end���stage kidney disease require vascular access during haemodialysis.
Central venous haemodialysis catheters are frequently used when permanent vascular access is not available.
Catheter problems contribute to greater morbidity and mortality.
Catheter malfunction leads to requirements for additional interventions, increased risk of catheter‐related infection and hospitalisation.
Standard care for the prevention of catheter malfunction is the use of heparin solutions as a post dialysis ‘lock’ in the catheter ports.
The potential impact of heparin treatment on bleeding risk is an acknowledged concern.
Therefore newer approaches have been proposed to seek improvements in catheter patency or treatment‐associated harm rates.
Study characteristics This review focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anticoagulants compared with conventional care for the prevention of catheter malfunction patients receiving haemodialysis.
Key results We found 27 studies, involving 3003 patients followed for an average six months, which assessed alternative anticoagulant locking solutions, systemic agents and low or no dose heparin.
Catheter malfunction were not affected by any of these classes of agents.
Subgroup analysis showed that the only agent reducing catheter malfunction was recombinant tissue plasminogen locking solution based on the results of a single study.
A significant reduction was observed on the incidence of catheter‐related bacteraemia for alternative anticoagulant locking solutions.
There was no evidence to suggest that alternative anticoagulants to heparin locking solutions had an effect on death rates or bleeding events, although only a small proportion of studies reported bleeding events.
Quality of the evidence Further high quality information is needed on both potential benefits and safety of alternative approaches to maintaining dialysis access catheter function.
