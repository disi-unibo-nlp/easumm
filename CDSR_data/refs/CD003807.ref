Interventions for preventing oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving treatment There is strong evidence that some antifungal drugs prevent oral candidiasis (thrush) caused by cancer treatment, but nystatin does not appear to work.
Treatment for cancer can lead to severe fungal infections (thrush) in the mouth.
This can cause discomfort, pain, difficulties in eating, longer stays in hospital and more worryingly, systemic infection and risk to life.
Different drugs are used to try and prevent this condition.
The review found strong evidence from a large number of trials that some of the antifungal drugs (those absorbed and partially absorbed into the body) help prevent fungal infections in the mouth.
Some other commonly used drugs such as nystatin, which are not absorbed into the body, do not appear to work.
