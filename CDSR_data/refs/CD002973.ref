Tracheal gas insufflation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated newborn infants Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) is a new technique to supplement mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care, but benefit and safety have not been proven.
Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI ‐ also called 'dead space washout') is a new add‐on technique for mechanical ventilation (machine‐assisted breathing) for babies in neonatal intensive care.
It requires new and expensive specialised equipment and skills.
TGI involves sending a continuing flow of air/oxygen into the lower part of a baby's trachea (windpipe).
The review found only one trial of TGI, which showed it might reduce the length of time babies need mechanical ventilation, but not necessarily reduce the time on oxygen therapy or the stay in hospital.
More research is needed to establish if this technology is safe and beneficial.
