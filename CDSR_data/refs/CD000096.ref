Glycerol for acute stroke There is not enough evidence to show if glycerol can reduce the disabling effects of brain swelling due to acute stroke.
Brain swelling (or oedema) is a major cause of early death and long‐term disability after stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds).
A 10% solution of glycerol might reduce brain swelling and therefore reduce the risk of death and long‐term disability after a stroke.
The review found some evidence that glycerol improves the short term survival after stroke, but there was not enough evidence to decide whether glycerol helps avoid disability after stroke.
Adverse effects of glycerol treatment did not happen often, but a small number of treated patients were found to have blood in their urine (this disappeared after the glycerol treatment was stopped).
More research is needed.
