Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism Background   Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition where a blood clot forms in the deep veins (most commonly of the leg) and can travel up to block the arteries in the lungs (a life‐threatening condition known as pulmonary embolism).
Treating VTE requires injections of a drug called heparin, which stops further clots forming.
Heparin comes in two forms: unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
UFH can be administered as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion or intermittently as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous), while LMWH is injected subcutaneously.
This review measures the effects of subcutaneous UFH versus IV UFH and LMWH for preventing recurrent clots, mortality and major bleeding.
This is an update of a review published in 2009.
Key results   After searching for relevant studies up to November 2016, we found one study to add to this update.
In total, we included 16 randomised controlled trials in 3593 participants in this review.
This update showed that there was no evidence of a difference between subcutaneous UFH versus intravenous UFH or subcutaneous LMWH for preventing recurrent clots, death or major bleeding.
Quality of the evidence   The quality of the evidence was low due to lack of blinding in the included studies and imprecision of the results due to the small number of reported events.
