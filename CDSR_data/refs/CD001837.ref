Interventions started during hospitalisation to help people to stop smoking Smoking contributes to many health problems including cancers, cardiovascular disease and lung diseases.
Smoking also increases the risk associated with hospitalisation for surgery.
People who are in hospital because of a smoking‐related illness are likely to be more receptive to help to give up smoking.
Our review of fifty trials found that effective programmes to stop smoking are those that begin during a hospital stay and include counselling with follow‐up support for at least one month after discharge.
Such programmes are effective when administered to all hospitalised smokers, regardless of the reason why they were admitted to hospital, and in the subset of smokers who are admitted to hospital with cardiovascular disease.
Adding nicotine replacement therapy to a counselling program increases the success rate of a program for hospitalised smokers.
