Lubeluzole for acute ischaemic stroke Lubeluzole is not effective in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.
After a stroke, where a part of the brain suffers from reduced blood supply, an excess of chemicals known as excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters is produced.
This excess can cause some brain cells to be damaged or to die (permanent cell damage is called cerebral infarction).
Drugs which block the effects of these amino acids can protect against the cerebral infarct.
The review focuses on the effects of lubeluzole, an inhibitor of excitatory amino acids.
The review of trials did not find any benefit of lubeluzole in humans either to prevent death after acute ischaemic stroke or to reduce disability from it.
Moreover, lubeluzole may cause heart‚Äêconduction disorders.
