There is no evidence to support routine drain use after liver resections Use of abdominal drainage after elective liver resections is controversial.
The rationale of inserting a drain in the abdomen is to prevent fluid collections in the abdomen and to detect post‐operative bleeding and bile leak.
The review on five clinical trials with 465 patients could present no evidence to support drain use.
However, the confidence intervals are wide, and reduced infective and chest complication rate of not draining may have been overlooked.
With respect to wound infection, the likelihood of getting an infection is almost doubled if suction drain is applied, compared to no drain at all.
More randomised trials are desirable as it would give further insights to the implications of the use of drains with respect to specific patient‐groups and types of operations.
