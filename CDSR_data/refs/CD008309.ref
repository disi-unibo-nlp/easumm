Laryngeal mask airway surfactant administration for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide the use of laryngeal mask surfactant administration in preterm infants at risk of respiratory distress syndrome.
Respiratory distress syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the naturally occurring lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant) and occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks' gestation).
The usual treatment includes instilling artificial surfactant directly into the newborn infant's trachea followed by mechanical ventilation.
However, this process can lead to lung injury, which can affect the infant's long term health.
A potential alternative strategy is to use a laryngeal mask as a delivery conduit for surfactant.
This procedure has the potential to reduce the need for tracheal intubation after birth and subsequent lung damage caused by mechanical ventilation.
This review found one small randomised controlled trial of laryngeal mask surfactant administration in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome that reported a short term reduction in oxygen requirements.
In view of the encouraging results from this trial and other observational human studies, high quality trials of laryngeal mask surfactant administration in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome are justified.
