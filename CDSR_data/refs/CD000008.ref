Acupuncture for chronic asthma Acupuncture is a treatment originating from traditional Chinese medicine.
It consists of the stimulation of defined points on the skin (mostly by insertion of needles).
The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence from randomised controlled trials that asthma patients benefit from acupuncture.
The studies included in the review were of variable quality and had inconsistent results.
Future research should concentrate on establishing whether there is a non‚Äêspecific component of acupuncture which benefits recipients of treatment.
There should be an assessment not merely of placebo treatment, but also of 'no treatment' as well.
There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the value of acupuncture as a treatment for asthma based on current evidence.
