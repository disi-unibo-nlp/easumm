The evidence from published randomised controlled trials is inadequate to establish the effectiveness of any drug for treating facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
More research is needed Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle disease.
Muscle weakness is often relatively mild and progression slow but around one fifth of affected people eventually become wheelchair‚Äêbound.
The muscles of the face, shoulder blades and upper arms are most severely effected, but weakness occurs in other muscles.
There is no agreed treatment.
Only two randomised controlled trials have been published.
One small trial of albuterol (also known as salbutamol)and another small trial of creatine (a dietary supplement for building muscle) were inadequate to confirm or refute a significant effect.
Further trials of albuterol, creatine and other agents are needed.
