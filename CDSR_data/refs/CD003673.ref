No evidence for efficacy and safety of indomethacin for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease Extensive evidence implicates inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin have been proposed for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Only one study met criteria for inclusion.
In this one selected trial, authors did not carry out statistical analyses on the absolute change from baseline, but on the percentage change from the baseline score.
Taking into account the difficulties in evaluating a single trial, at present there is no indication for treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with indomethacin.
