Preconception health programs and interventions for women who are overweight or obese to improve pregnancy outcomes for the woman and her infant Being overweight or obese, or having a high body weight for one's height, is becoming increasingly common among women of reproductive age.
General health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnoea (pauses or reduced breathing during sleep), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause reduced fertility or failure to achieve pregnancy, are associated with being overweight or obese.
During pregnancy, overweight women are at increased risk of sugar intolerance (gestational diabetes), pregnancy‐related high blood pressure, losing a pregnancy (miscarriage), birth before some 40 weeks (preterm birth) and congenital birth defects such as neural tube and heart defects, and gastrointestinal malformations.
Women who are overweight or obese are also at a higher risk of complications during labour including heavy blood loss after giving birth.
Current guidelines about which preconception health programs or interventions are of benefit to reduce these adverse health outcomes are needed for overweight and obese women.
This Cochrane review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions, however no randomised controlled trials were found.
We recommend that further research is conducted in this area so that the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established specifically for overweight and obese women.
Programs can provide information, screening for and treating obesity‐related health problems, dietary and exercise advice and medical or surgical interventions, depending on the resources available and the individual needs of the woman.
