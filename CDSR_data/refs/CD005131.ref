Oestrogens for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in postmenopausal women Recurrent urinary tract infection (RUTI) is defined as three episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the previous 12 months or two episodes in the last six months.
In postmenopausal women the prevalence rate for having one episode of UTI in a given year varies from 8% to 10%.
This increased risk is associated with a decrease in oestrogen levels.
The use of oestrogens (orally or vaginally) has been proposed as a preventive strategy.
This review identified nine studies (3345 women) treated with oestrogens versus placebo, no treatment or antibiotics.
Vaginal oestrogens reduced the number of UTIs when compared to placebo.
All studies reported adverse events for the oestrogen treatment groups.
These included breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding or spotting, vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, burning and itching.
