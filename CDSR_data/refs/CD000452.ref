Support for mothers, fathers and families after perinatal death It is devastating for parents and families when a baby dies.
It is estimated that approximately one in five parents will suffer from intense and prolonged grief following the death of a baby around the time of birth.
It is essential that parents and families are offered, and have access to, appropriate support from caregivers and their direct social network.
Yet, little is known about the role and the true effectiveness of different types of bereavement support for parents and their families.
This review aimed to identify clinical trials to assess the effect of different types of bereavement support interventions and/or counselling for parents experiencing perinatal death.
There are no included studies on this topic.
For the update of this review we identified one new trial, which is currently awaiting classification.
More research in this area is needed.
