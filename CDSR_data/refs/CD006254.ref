Calcimimetics for secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients Abnormal calcium and phosphorous levels in the blood and tissues occur in chronic kidney disease.
These changes are linked to shorter survival and hardening of the arteries leading to heart disease.
Standard therapy for abnormal calcium and other mineral levels includes dietary restrictions, phosphorous binders and vitamin D compounds.
A newer treatment called cinacalcet showed promise for improving abnormal mineral levels but the effects of this drug on patient outcomes (the way patients feel function and survive) were unclear from early studies.
We have updated an earlier review dated 2006 to include studies that assessed the effects of cinacalcet in about 7500 people with chronic kidney disease.
While cinacalcet improves some blood abnormalities, it does not improve risk of death or heart disease in people treated with dialysis.
In addition, people who take cinacalcet may experience increased nausea, vomiting and the need for blood tests to check blood calcium levels.
The current research is high‚Äêquality and means that additional new studies are unlikely to change our confidence in these results.
Information for the use of cinacalcet in people with milder forms of kidney disease and those with a kidney transplant is insufficient to guide decision making.
