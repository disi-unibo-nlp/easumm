Colony stimulating factors (including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor and analogues) for stroke Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) are naturally occurring hormones that control the production of circulating blood cells by the bone marrow.
Some CSFs also release stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream; these could help the brain repair itself after stroke.
In experiments of stroke, CSFs show the potential to improve disability caused by a stroke.
In this analysis, we assessed the effect of CSFs on outcome after stroke using data from clinical trials of people with recent stroke.
We included a total of 11 studies and 1275 participants.
A higher death rate was observed in participants treated with erythropoietin (EPO) in three trials (782 participants); whether further trials of EPO will be performed early after stroke remains unclear.
In eight small trials involving 548 participants, patterns of improvement after a stroke were observed using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‚ÄêCSF) and further trials are ongoing.
Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CSFs in the treatment of people with recent stroke.
