Herbal treatment for premenstrual syndrome Herbal medicines are sometimes used for treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
However, the effectiveness of this type of therapy has not be rigorously evaluated in randomised controlled trials.
The authors identified two trials that evaluated herbal medicines in PMS.
One of these was a higher quality study that tested the traditional Chinese medicine decoction Jingqianping granule.
This was shown to increase the rate of recovery from PMS symptoms.
Because the formula for this herbal medicine was provided by the trialists themselves, the review authors recommend further trials to ensure that the results are reproducible with other formulations.
Strong evidence in support of other herbal formulae for the treatment of PMS is currently lacking.
