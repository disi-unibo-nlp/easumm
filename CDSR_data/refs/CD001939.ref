Branched‐chain amino acids improve symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy Background Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction associated with liver disease.
Cirrhosis, which is a condition where scar tissue (fibrosis) replaces the normal liver tissue, is the most common cause of hepatic encephalopathy.
The severity of the symptoms range from minor signs to coma.
The minor changes are known as minimal hepatic encephalopathy.
Overt hepatic encephalopathy refers to the more severe stages with clinically apparent manifestations such as changes in the level of consciousness or neuropsychiatric abnormalities.
Many people with cirrhosis lack amino acids, which are building blocks of proteins.
The amino acids with a side‐chain (a branch) are known as branched‐chain amino acids (BCAA).
The BCAA play an important part of the generation muscles and of the signalling chemicals in the brain.
These effects may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.
Study characteristics We identified 16 randomised clinical trials (trials where participants are randomly allocated to treatment groups) including 827 participants.
The included people had cirrhosis often due to alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis (liver infection due to a virus).
The trials compared BCAA with placebo (a pretend treatment), no intervention, diets, lactulose (a liquid sugar often used to treat constipation), or neomycin (an antibiotic).
The evidence is current to October 2014.
Key results The analyses found no effect on mortality, but that BCAA had a beneficial effect on symptoms and signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
BCAA did not increase the risk of serious adverse events, but was associated with nausea and diarrhoea.
When excluding trials on lactulose or neomycin, BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy.
When analysing trials with a lactulose or neomycin control, we found no beneficial or detrimental effect of BCAA.
Quality of the evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence to evaluate aspects that can lead to errors in the judgment of intervention effects.
We concluded that we had high quality evidence in our analyses about the effect of BCAA on hepatic encephalopathy.
We concluded that we had moderate or low quality evidence in the remaining analyses because the number of participants in the trials was too small and the risk of bias (systematic errors) was unclear or high.
