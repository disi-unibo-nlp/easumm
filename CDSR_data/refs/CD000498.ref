Intraventricular streptokinase after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants There is no evidence of benefit from giving streptokinase to newborn babies after brain haemorrhage.Bleeding (hemorrhage) into the ventricles of the brain is a serious complication of premature birth and large hemorrhages often lead to hydrocephalus, the process by which fluid accumulates under pressure inside the brain, expanding the head excessively and damaging the brain tissue.
The insertion of a valve and drainage system (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) is fraught with problems in this patient group and alternatives to this therapy are needed.
A possible approach is to try to dissolve the blood clots initially blocking the reabsorption of fluid in the brain.
Streptokinase is a "clot‐busting" agent that has been successfully used to unblock coronary arteries.
The review found no good evidence that intraventricular injection of streptokinase to infants with large intraventricular hemorrhage or post‐hemorrhagic ventricular enlargement reduces the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt or improves outcome.
