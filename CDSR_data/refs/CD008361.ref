Narrow band imaging colonoscopy is not better than white light colonoscopy in detecting the patients with colorectal polyps.
Cancer of the large bowel is the third most common cancer worldwide.
It has been suggested that colorectal polyps are precursors of colorectal cancer.
Consequently, early detection and removal of colorectal polyps is important in secondary prevention of colorectal cancer.
A number of randomised trials comparing narrow band imaging colonoscopy (a high resolution endoscopic technique that enhances the fine structure of the mucosal surface) with white light colonoscopy for detection of colorectal polyps reported variable results.
This review analysed the role of narrow band imaging colonoscopy compared to the white light colonoscopy for detection of colorectal polyps.
In total eight randomised trials with 3673 participants were able to provide data for our analyses.
Narrow band imaging colonoscopy was not better than high definition white light colonoscopy for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps.
We found weak evidence that narrow band imaging colonoscopy could be better than conventional white light colonoscopy for detection of patients with colorectal polyps.
