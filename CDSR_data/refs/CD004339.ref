Adding arginine to prevent necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants What is the issue?
Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a condition in which inflammation damages an infant's gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
The rate of NEC ranges from 4% to 22% in very low birth weight infants.
Necrotising enterocolitis may be caused by an infant's immaturity, lack of blood flow to the GI tract and surface (mucosa) breakdown resulting from infection or feeding with formula.
To protect the GI tract, the body makes a natural substance ‐ nitric oxide ‐ from the amino acid arginine.
Plasma arginine concentrations are reported to be low in very low birth weight infants and preterm infants who develop NEC.
Adding extra arginine to the feeding solution may prevent NEC.
Why is this important?
NEC can result in permanent damage to the intestine, the need for multiple surgeries, prolonged hospital stay, death and increased cost to the healthcare system.
What evidence did we find?
Review authors searched the literature for controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of arginine supplementation.
Adding extra arginine to a preterm infant's feed reduced the risk of NEC in three good quality studies that included 285 infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation.
Six infants had to be treated, for one to benefit from treatment.
Researchers reported no significant side effects directly attributable to too much arginine in the first 28 days, and one study reported no long‐term (36 months) developmental delays.
Possible effects of supplementing arginine include lower blood pressure and changes in blood glucose control.
What does this mean?
Arginine supplementation may reduce the incidence and severity of NEC in preterm infants.
Results are limited, as studies included only a few patients.
A large study that includes infants from multiple centres is needed to verify these findings.
