Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and opioids can significantly relieve the pain in acute renal colic, but opioids (especially pethidine) cause more adverse effects Acute renal colic occurs when mineral or organic solids pass though the urinary tract and obstruct the urinary flow.
It causes a sudden onset of severe pain, which radiates from the flank to the groin and requires immediate treatment with pain‐killers.
It can also cause nausea, vomiting, hypertension and blood in the urine.
Opioids and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce the pain.
The review found that both NSAIDs and opioids significantly reduce the pain.
People experienced more adverse effects, such as vomiting, when using opioids (particularly pethidine) than when using NSAIDs.
