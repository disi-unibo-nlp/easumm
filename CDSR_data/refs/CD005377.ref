Atypical antipsychotics for people with both schizophrenia and depression It is well known that depression occurs in people with schizophrenia.
Atypical antipsychotics are used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia but their specific effects on those with schizophrenia and depression are unclear, although they are marketed for this purpose.
In this review we evaluated the effects of atypical antipsychotics for people with both schizophrenia and depression and unfortunately found a distinct lack of information.
We wanted to assess the available evidence to ascertain whether atypical antipsychotic drugs represent a better alternative than older neuroleptic medications [plus or minus adjunctive antidepressant therapy] for people with both depression and schizophrenia.
However, due to the paucity of trials of antipsychotic drugs that are sold as also having antidepressant effects, we were unable to draw any firm conclusions.
More well‚Äêconducted randomised controlled trials are needed.
