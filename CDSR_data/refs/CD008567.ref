General physical health care advice for people with serious mental illness People with serious mental illness tend to have poorer physical health than the general population with a greater risk of contracting diseases and often die at an early age.
In schizophrenia, for example, life expectancy is reduced by about 10 years.
People with mental health problems have higher rates of heart problems (cardiovascular disease), infectious diseases (including HIV and AIDS), diabetes, breathing and respiratory disease, and cancer.
Advising people on ways to improve their physical health is not without problems since there is often a perception, that advice offered is ineffective and will be ignored but it has been shown that healthcare professional advice can have a positive impact on behaviour.
Advice can often motivate people to seek further support and treatment.
Health advice could improve the quality and duration of life of people with serious mental illness.

More work is needed in this area.
