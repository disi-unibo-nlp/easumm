Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients at a very early stage of the disease with recombinant interferon beta (IFN beta‐1a and IFN beta‐1b ) or glatiramer acetate (GA) could be useful in preventing irreversible damage in the central nervous system Treatment of relapsing‐remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) is currently based on immunomodulatory drugs such as recombinant interferon (IFN beta‐1a and IFN beta‐1b) or glatiramer acetate (GA) although these therapies have been shown to be only modestly effective.
Recently it has been suggested that the nervous damage, supported by inflammation processes, is an early event in MS evolution which immunomodulatory drugs can only partially prevent.
IFN and GA demonstrated only partial efficacy that could be ascribed to the fact that in the studies that lead to their approval they have been initiated in patients with a disease history of several years.
The objective of this review was to assess IFN beta and GA efficacy in preventing the conversion to clinically defined multiple sclerosis in patients after the first demyelinating events.
Among the pertinent literature, only three studies were found to test the efficacy of IFN beta including a total of 1160 participants (639 under treatment, 521 under placebo); while no published study testing the efficacy of GA was found.
The review found that early interferon beta‐1a treatment is effective in preventing the conversion of the first isolated demyelinating episodes into clinically definite MS both after one year and two years of follow‐up.
Side effects and adverse events occurrence was the same as reported by the many studies on IFN beta treatments in MS patients with different levels of the disease.
More research is however needed to evaluate the long term preventing efficacy of these drugs and dosages.
