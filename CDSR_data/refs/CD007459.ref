Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self‐management of long‐term illnesses Many people suffer from long‐term conditions such as asthma or diabetes.
To make living with the long‐term illnesses as easy as possible, people have to regularly monitor the symptoms of their conditions and adapt their lifestyles.
This review studied whether mobile phone applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) (also known as text messaging) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) can support people to better manage their long‐term illnesses by sending medication reminders or supportive messages, or by offering a way for people to communicate important information to their healthcare providers and receive feedback.
We found moderate quality evidence that under some conditions these types of applications may indeed have some positive impacts on the health status of patients with diabetes, hypertension and asthma, and on their ability to manage their own condition, although for some outcomes no significant effect was observed.
In two studies, there was very low quality evidence that participants evaluated the mobile phone messaging support positively.
Also, in two studies, there was very low quality evidence that: there was no difference in health service utilisation by diabetes patients receiving text messaging support and those who did not (one study); and that asthma patients receiving text messages visited the doctor more often but were admitted to hospital less often than those not receiving the messages (one study).
Because of the small number of patients involved in these studies the evidence is not very strong.
Furthermore, the usefulness and potential negative consequences of mobile phone messaging over extended periods of use for self‐managing long‐term conditions are not yet known.
