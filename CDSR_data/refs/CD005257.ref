Interventions for non‚Äêoliguric hyperkalaemia in preterm neonates Elevated levels of potassium (an important salt for normal body functions) are common in infants born very preterm or with birth weight less than 1500 g. High potassium levels in the blood may lead to irregular or rapid heart rate that may result in bleedings in the brain and/or sudden death.
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for this serious condition.
Two studies enrolling 52 infants that assessed the use of a combination of insulin and sugar to reduce the blood levels of potassium were identified.
This combination reduced the duration of high blood levels of potassium and the risk for bleeds in the brains of the infants.
One study that enrolled 19 patients reported on the use of albuterol (a medication that helps to move potassium from the blood to the body cells).
Albuterol lowered the blood levels of potassium both at four and at eight hours after the treatment had started.
Because of the few infants enrolled in the studies to date, no firm recommendations for the treatment of too high blood levels of potassium in neonates can be made.
Further research is needed.
