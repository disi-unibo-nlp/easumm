Radiotherapy compared to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for patients with advanced rectal cancer before they have surgery.
We compared radiotherapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgery in rectal cancer.
We looked at people who had rectal cancer that had spread to the lymph glands but not to the liver or other organs.
We found that both groups had the same number of people alive after 5 years.
In other words; neither treatment was better at making people live longer than the other.
People who had chemotherapy and radiotherapy had more short term problems (such as diarrhoea) than people who just had radiotherapy.
However, we found that people who had both treatments had less cancer return at the site of the original tumour after 5 years.
This is an important finding and suggests that this treatment is may be more beneficial.
