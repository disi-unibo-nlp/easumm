Early versus delayed selective surfactant treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome Giving early selective surfactant to newborn babies on assisted ventilation who have early signs of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) reduces the risk of short‐term and longer‐term lung injury.
Pulmonary surfactant is a substance that prevents the air sacs of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension.
Surfactant is often lacking in the lungs of newborn babies with RDS.
The effectiveness of surfactant extracts in increasing their survival rate has been confirmed.
The question remains about the best time to start giving surfactant.
The review of trials compared early selective treatment of RDS (within the first two hours of life) to late selective treatment and found evidence of the benefit of early therapy.
