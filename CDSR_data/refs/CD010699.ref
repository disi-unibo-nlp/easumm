Belatacept for kidney transplant recipients Kidney transplants can improve the quality and length of life for patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) compared with chronic dialysis.
To prevent a kidney transplant from being rejected by the body, immune‐system suppressing drugs (most commonly a calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)) are used.
CNI are associated with high blood pressure, high lipid levels, an increased risk of developing diabetes, and chronic scarring of the kidney transplant.
Chronic kidney scarring is the main reason that kidney transplants lose function in people who do not die before their kidney transplant fails.
Belatacept might be an alternative immune‐system suppressing drug which prevents rejection but which also causes fewer side‐effects than CNI.
We included five studies that compared belatacept and calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and enrolled 1535 kidney transplant recipients.
We found that belatacept was no different to a CNI at being able to prevent acute rejection and at keeping a transplanted kidney working.
Recipients who received belatacept had lower blood pressure, less diabetes and better kidney transplant function than recipients who received a CNI.
The chance of dying after a kidney transplant was similar in recipients treated with belatacept and CNI.
