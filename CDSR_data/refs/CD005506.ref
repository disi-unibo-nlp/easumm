Anti‚Äêsickness medication for vomiting in acute stomach upsets in children Vomiting caused by acute gastroenteritis is very common in children and adolescents.
Treatment of vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis can be problematic and there is lack of agreement among clinicians on the indications for the use of antiemetics.
There have also been concerns expressed about apparently unacceptable levels of side effects with some of the older generation of antiemetics.
The small number of included trials provided evidence which appeared to favour the use of antiemetics over placebo to reduce the number of episodes of vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children.
A single oral dose of ondansetron given to children with mild to moderate dehydration can control vomiting, avoid hospitalization and intravenous fluid administration which would otherwise be needed.
There were no major side effects other than a few reports of increased frequency of diarrhea.
