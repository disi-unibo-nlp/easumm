Interleukin 2 receptor antagonists (IL2Ra) reduce the risk of acute rejection episodes at six and twelve months after kidney transplantation Acute rejection is a major problem in the early period following kidney transplantation.
Immunosuppressive drugs are used to prevent this.
IL2Ra, a newer antibody therapy, can be added to a patient's existing immunosuppression to further reduce the risk of rejection.
This review found that adding IL2Ra reduced the risk of graft loss or death with a functioning transplant, acute rejection, and early malignancy, but did not improve patient survival.
Compared to ATG, another possible antibody option, IL2Ra treatment caused less CMV disease and malignancy and had fewer side effects, but although there was no difference in clinically diagnosed acute rejection, IL2Ra treatment resulted in more biopsy proven rejection at 1 year.
