Treatment for paraneoplastic neuropathies (nerve damage associated with cancer that is not caused by cancer invasion or other pre‐existing mechanism) Paraneoplastic neuropathies are the most frequently reported paraneoplastic syndromes.
The term paraneoplastic neuropathy is used for nerve damage in cancer that is not caused by direct spread of the cancer into the nerve, toxicity of treatments, metabolic derangement, virus infections or other obvious causes.
It is generally accepted that an immune reaction to the cancer causes 'bystander' damage to the nerves.
Paraneoplastic neuropathies are varied in character and require several therapeutic approaches.
We undertook this review to systematically assess any available data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of paraneoplastic neuropathies, concentrating first on evidence of the highest quality.
Despite many reports on paraneoplastic neuropathy, we identified no RCTs for inclusion in this review.
From the non‐randomised evidence, we found only six studies, involving a total of 54 participants, that were suitable for inclusion in the discussion according to our predefined quality criteria.
These studies were not readily comparable.
At present there are no RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of treatment for paraneoplastic neuropathies on which to base practice.
There is only evidence from case series, case reports or expert opinion (class IV) for the effect of immunomodulation (intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, steroid treatment or chemotherapy) on paraneoplastic neuropathy.
