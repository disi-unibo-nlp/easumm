Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a urinary tract infection (without symptoms) common in pregnancy.
If untreated, it can lead to pyelonephritis (kidney infection).
Antibiotic treatment is recommended.
This review aimed to identify whether single‐dose antibiotic treatments are as effective as longer ones for maternal and newborn outcomes.
In general, the risk of bias of trials included in this review was largely unclear.
The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
The review of 13 studies, involving over 1622 women, found that a seven‐day regimen is more effective than a one‐day course, especially for the outcome of low birthweight ( high quality evidence ), but this result is based on just one study.
There were no clear differences between a single dose and a four‐ to seven‐day short course of antibiotics for other review outcomes, including kidney infection ( very low quality evidence ) and preterm birth ( moderate quality evidence ).
Women with a single‐dose regimen reported fewer side effects ( low quality evidence ).
More trials are needed to confirm which length of treatment is best for women and babies.
