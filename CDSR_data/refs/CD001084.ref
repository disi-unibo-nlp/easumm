Pharmacotherapy for Behcet's syndrome Behcet's syndrome is a multisystemic disorder presenting with recurrent oral and genital ulcerations as well as ocular involvement.
Treatment of Behcet's syndrome is symptomatic and empirical.
Ten trials and 679 patients were included.
There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute some of the classic treatments for Behcet's syndrome, including colchicine, cyclophosphamide and steroids for eye involvement, azapropazone and colchicine for arthritis and acyclovir, colchicine and topical interpheron for aphthas.
The results confirm the protective effects of cyclosporine and azathioprine for eye involvement and benzathine‐penicillin for arthritis.
We conclude that further randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind trials should be carried out to compare cyclosporine, azathioprine and benzathine‐penicillin versus placebo in order to make the results generalizable and comparable.
