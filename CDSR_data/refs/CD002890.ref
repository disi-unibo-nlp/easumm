Using psychological treatments to help people manage thalassaemia Thalassaemia is a group of genetic blood disorders.
Blood transfusion is needed to treat severe forms of the condition, but this results in a high level of iron in the body.
This excess iron is usually removed by drugs through 'chelation therapy'.
Other less usual treatments are bone marrow transplantation, which is restricted by age, and hydroxyurea, a drug designed to raise the level of foetal haemoglobin and reduce anaemia.
Psychological support would seem suitable to manage thalassaemia which is a chronic disease with a considerable role for self‚Äêmanagement.
We were not able to find any trials to include in this review.
There are some reports that teaching people about their condition improves adherence to chelation therapy.
However, from the information currently available, we can not recommend the use of specific psychological therapies in thalassaemia.
We believe there is a need for large trials to assess the value of psychological therapies for thalassaemia.
