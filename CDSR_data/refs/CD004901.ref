Misoprostol for induction of labour to terminate pregnancy in the second or third trimester for women with a fetal anomaly or following intrauterine fetal death A woman may need to give birth prior to the spontaneous onset of labour in middle to late pregnancy to terminate the pregnancy in situations where the fetus, if born alive, would not survive or would have permanent handicaps, or where the fetus has died in utero (also called a stillbirth).
Misoprostol is a prostaglandin medication that can be used to induce labour in these situations.
This review included 38 randomised controlled studies, involving 3679 women.
Vaginal misoprostol was as effective as other agents in inducing labour and achieving vaginal birth within 24 hours, with a reduction in the occurrence of maternal side effects.
Side effects include gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).
The information on rare adverse events (including uterine rupture) is limited.
