Enteral iron supplementation in preterm and low birth weight infants This review examined whether providing iron supplementation is beneficial for preterm and low birth weight infants.
The potential benefits included improvements in the level of red blood cells and stored iron in their blood.
In the longer term, it was thought that iron supplementation might improve the babies' growth and development.
We identified 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were relevant to this topic.
We concluded that the long term benefits of iron supplementation for preterm and low birth weight babies remain uncertain.
Regarding red blood cell and iron levels, it was found that in the first year of life, after two months of age, iron supplementation may result in slightly higher iron stores and red blood cell levels, and lower rates of iron deficiency anaemia.
However, there was a lot of variability between different studies.
More RCTs are needed, using well defined patient groups.
