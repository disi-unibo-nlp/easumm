Insulin monotherapy versus combinations of insulin with oral hypoglycaemic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus Simple application of a single daily insulin injection in addition to oral hypoglycaemic agents may facilitate the initiation of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.This review examined 20 trials including 1,811 participants which compared insulin monotherapy with insulin in combination with oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) in insulin‐requiring patients with type 2 diabetes.
The results suggest that a bedtime NPH insulin‐oral hypoglycaemic agent combination therapy regimen provides comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy.
Due to lack of studies it remains unclear whether insulin‐OHA combination regimens with metformin alone are superior to those with metformin plus a sulphonylurea.
In most cases no significant differences in hypoglycaemic events were observed between insulin mono‐ and OHA combination therapy.
No study assessed diabetes‐related morbidity or mortality.
