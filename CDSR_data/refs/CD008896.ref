Ways to increase use of non‐hormonal long‐acting birth control The copper intrauterine device (copper IUD) is a highly‐effective non‐hormonal type of birth control, and is the most commonly used method in the world.
However, use of the copper IUD is low in countries with relatively high rates of unintended pregnancy, such as the United Kingdom and United States.
Our review looked at studies of different interventions to improve use of the copper IUD.
We did computer searches for relevant studies and looked at the reference lists of study reports to identify more studies.
We found nine studies of moderate to low quality.
Three studies on contraceptive counselling and referrals by community workers showed an increase in use of the copper IUD.
Two studies on antenatal contraceptive counselling and one study on postnatal couple counselling, with provision of an information leaflet before being discharged from the maternity ward, also showed an increase in use of the copper IUD.
A study on postnatal home visits and two studies on enhanced postabortion contraceptive counselling did not show an increase in use of the copper IUD.
More high‐quality research is needed to look at the longer‐term effectiveness of interventions to improve use of the copper IUD.
