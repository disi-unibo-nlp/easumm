Short‐acting beta2‐agonists for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease This review has shown that regular use for at least seven days of inhaled beta‐2 medicines that relieve airways obstruction and can also improve the symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in most patients but not all.
Patients are far more likely to prefer treatment with these type of medicines than with placebo, and less likely to fail or drop‐out from treatment when treated with such medicines.
Regular treatment with such inhaled medicines should be reserved for those patients who report symptomatic and clinical benefit from their use.
Newer, long acting bronchodilators are currently available, and they may be more practical and/or effective in these patients.
However, this review indicates that these older inexpensive drugs are effective in the treatment of COPD.
