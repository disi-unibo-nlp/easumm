Vaginal misoprostol is effective in inducing labour but more research is needed on safety Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby.
Misoprostol is a hormone given by insertion through the vagina or rectum, or by mouth to ripen the cervix and bring on labour.
The review of 121 trials found that larger doses of misoprostol are more effective than prostaglandin and that oxytocin is used in addition less often.
However, misoprostol also increases hyperstimulation of the uterus.
With smaller doses, the results are similar to other methods.
The trials reviewed are too small to determine whether the risk of rupture of the uterus is increased.
More research is needed into the safety and best dosages of misoprostol.
Another Cochrane review has shown that the oral route of administration is preferable to the vaginal route.
