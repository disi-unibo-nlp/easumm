Immediate closure or delayed closure for treating traumatic wounds in the first 24 hours following injury Acute traumatic wounds, for example tears, cuts, and scrapes, are a common reason why people go to the emergency department.
Primary closure (which is bringing the edges of the wound together with stitches, adhesive tape, staples or glue) is usually used on wounds which are treated quickly (within 6 hours of injury) and which are clean of debris.
Wounds can be contaminated by dirt and debris and in these cases may not be closed until later, meaning a delayed closure.
If this happens, the wound is cleaned, left for two to three days, checked to see if it is still clean and then closed.
This is thought to reduce the chances of becoming infected.
Primary closure has the potential benefit of rapid wound healing but may lead to an increased chance of infection.
We wanted to determine the effects on healing, and any adverse effects, of immediate closure compared with delayed closure.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials but found no studies which answered the question.
There is currently no evidence to suggest the best timing for closing acute traumatic wounds to promote the best healing.
