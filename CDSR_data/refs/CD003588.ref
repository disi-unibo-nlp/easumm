Optimal timing for intravascular administration set replacement The tubing (administration set) attached to venous and arterial catheters may contribute to bloodstream infection.
The rate of infection may be increased or decreased by scheduled replacement of administration sets.
The objective of this review was to identify any association between the frequency with which administration sets were replaced and rates of microbial colonization, bloodstream infection and death.
We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE) to June 2012.
We identified 16 studies with 5001 participants for inclusion in this updated review.
No evidence suggests that bloodstream infection was more or less likely with more frequent changes, although the quality of included trials was low to moderate.
Some evidence indicates that mortality was increased in neonates receiving parenteral nutrition when administration set replacement was less frequent.
