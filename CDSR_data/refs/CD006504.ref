Cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease and dementia The clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) have much in common.
As patients with DLB and PDD have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, blocking its breakdown using a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement.
Six trials showed a statistically significant improvement in global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND‐PD) patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors.
There was no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND‐PD.
In a single trial, no statistically significant improvement was observed in patients with DLB who were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and further trials are necessary to clarify the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient group.
