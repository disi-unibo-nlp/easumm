Medical day hospital care for the elderly versus alternative forms of care Day hospitals are one way of delivering healthcare to older people.
They are out‐patient facilities which older patients attend for a full or near full day and receive multidisciplinary health care ‘under one roof.’ Sixteen trials involving 3689 participants were included in this review and compared day hospitals with other comprehensive services (including inpatient and outpatient services), home based care and no comprehensive services.
Attendance at a day hospital offers benefits compared to providing no treatment which include reducing the risk of needing more help with daily activities such as washing or dressing.
Furthermore, patients are less likely to suffer one of the following: dying, being institutionalised or becoming more dependent on others.
There is no apparent benefit when day hospitals are compared with other comprehensive services or home care.
The economic value of day hospitals when compared with other health care services remains unclear.
