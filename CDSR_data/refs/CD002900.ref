The review found that both, D&C and vacuum aspiration, are safe and effective methods for first trimester termination of pregnancy and complications are rare.
There are several different surgical techniques for early termination of pregnancy (abortion in the first three months).
These are dilatation and curettage (D&C to scrape out the contents of the uterus), vacuum aspiration (sucking out the contents of the uterus with a manual or power‚Äêoperated device).
Hysterotomy (surgery through the uterus, like caesarean section) is not commonly used.
The cervix (opening of the uterus) can be prepared beforehand with hormones to minimise the risk of damage.
