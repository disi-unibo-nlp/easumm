Preoperative intra aortic balloon pumps in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting may suffer from heart failure in the immediate hours following surgery due to stunning of the heart muscle.
Drugs may be required to support the heart if this happens.
Increasingly, a device called an intra aortic balloon pump is used as a mechanical assist device to help such patients.
The device is a balloon which is positioned close to the heart in the main blood vessel called the aorta.
By inflating and deflating with beats of the heart it acts to increase blood flow to the heart as well as reduce the amount of work the heart is doing.
This is a temporary device which supports the heart during the immediate post operative period.
Recent evidence suggests that certain patients may benefit from a period of support with the balloon pump before their operation in order to try and optimise heart function before the stress of surgery.
This review suggests the intra aortic balloon pump may be beneficial in terms of survival from the operation however there are many problems with the validity of the trials used in this review and a categorical answer to this question requires further randomised controlled trials.
