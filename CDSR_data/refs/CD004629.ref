Interferon‐alpha in the maintenance therapy of follicular non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma The aim of this systematic review is to outline the possible benefits (i.e.
prolonging survival) and also the disadvantages (adverse events) of therapy with interferon‐alpha, administered alone or in combination with other proven drug regimens (otherwise known as chemotherapy) to patients affected by follicular non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Interferons are proteins secreted by vertebrate cells that exhibit various biological actions.
They confer resistance against many different viruses, inhibit proliferation of normal and malignant cells, augment natural killer cell activity, and show several other immunomodulatory functions.
Interferons, types alfa‐2a or alfa‐2b, are usually administered in combination with other drugs to treat a variety of infective and neoplastic diseases.
The results showed a significant benefit in progression‐free survival in patients treated with interferon‐alpha alone or combined with chemotherapy as compared with comparator therapies.
There was, however, less evidence that interferon‐alpha supported any benefit on overall survival.
Furthermore, the presence of relevant drug‐related adverse events suggested that a careful analysis of the risks and benefits has to be performed when making a specific clinical decision about this therapy.
