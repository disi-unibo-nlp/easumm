Therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy No evidence to support routine therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of epilepsy.
No evidence was found to indicate that the routine measurement of serum drug concentrations to inform drug dose adjustments is superior to drug dose adjustments made on clinical grounds alone in newly‐diagnosed epilepsy patients treated with a single drug: carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone.
One under‐powered study was found, and this review does not exclude the possibility that therapeutic drug monitoring might be useful in patients with newly‐diagnosed epilepsy, nor does it exclude the possible usefulness of monitoring in special situations or in selected patients.
