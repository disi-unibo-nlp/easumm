Genetic testing for predicting and preventing severe skin rashes caused by drugs Review question The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if genetic testing for certain genotypes (i.e.
the presence or absence of a particular gene variation) before prescribing drugs can prevent serious skin reactions in people prescribed drugs that are known to cause delayed type hypersensitivity reactions (i.e.
allergic skin rash up to six weeks after taking the prescribed medicine).
People who had this type of test were compared with those who did not.
We searched for all relevant studies so we could analyse them to answer this question, but we found only one study.
Background Different types of medications can cause unwanted effects, which include skin rashes.
These reactions are often a mild skin rash; however, rarely (but possibly) the drug may cause skin detachment, fever, and internal organ involvement, which can be life‐threatening.
Severe cases may require hospitalisation and treatment in specialised burns units.
It is not fully understood how these reactions occur and which people are at increased risk of developing these reactions, but it is known that genetic factors may play a role.
Research has been conducted into the use of simple genetic tests to predict these reactions and thus prevent them.
Study characteristics We found only one relevant study.
It included 1956 adult participants, of whom 74% were men, who tested positive for HIV‐type 1 and were eligible to start highly active antiretroviral therapy including a medication called abacavir.
(Antiretrovirals are a drug class used for treating patients with HIV infection.)
The age of study participants ranged from 18 to 77 years; the average age was 42 years.
The participants were from 19 countries around the world in 265 healthcare centres (e.g.
hospitals, clinics).
This study investigated whether the following can reduce the rate of serious skin reactions to abacavir: genetic testing for the genetic marker HLA‐B*57:01 before prescribing abacavir (i.e.
prospective testing) versus no prospective genetic testing for HLA‐B*57:01.
HLA‐B*57:01 is known to be key in developing severe skin reactions to the HIV antiretroviral drug, abacavir.
Participants who tested positive for the genotype were not given abacavir; instead, they were given a different antiretroviral therapy.
The study lasted six months and each participant was observed for six weeks.
GlaxoSmithKline, the company that manufactures abacavir, funded the study.
Control participants had HLA‐B*5701 pharmacogenetic testing after they had received abacavir as standard of care.
Key results Our one included study did not report data for all participants, and clinical assessment of hypersensitivity (HSS) was done at the time of study entry, at baseline (day one) and at weeks one, two and six, without using predefined criteria.
These can be important sources of bias and the quality of evidence was therefore judged to be moderate.
Available data showed that prospective HLA‐B*57:01 screening probably reduces the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir (including, but not limited to, our secondary outcomes of hypersensitivity (HSS) syndrome and Stevens‐Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (i.e.
severe and blistering skin reactions caused by medications)).
Based on these results, we would expect that out of 1000 people who did not have prospective pharmacogenetic screening (i.e.
screening to assess how someone might respond to a particular drug), 78 would experience a hypersensitivity reaction including SJS/TEN (clinical assessment), compared with between 22 and 52 people who did have prospective pharmacogenetic screening to test for HLA‐B*57:01.
Furthermore, we would expect that out of 1000 people who did not have prospective pharmacogenetic screening (standard care), 27 would experience a hypersensitivity reaction including SJS/TEN (immunologically confirmed), compared with zero participants who had prospective pharmacogenetic screening to test for HLA‐B*57:01.
A patch test on the skin provided immunological confirmation 6 to 10 weeks after clinical diagnosis.
The study did not measure the other outcomes of this review.
The evidence is current to July 2018.
Quality of the evidence The included study was rated as being of moderate quality.
Some patients were withdrawn from the study and not included in the analyses, and the investigator that diagnosed HSS reactions did not use a predefined clinical criteria of hypersensitivity.
These issues caused us to downgrade the certainty of the evidence.
