Sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus artesunate versus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine for treating uncomplicated malaria Sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP plus AQ) performed better than sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP plus AS) when treating uncomplicated malaria Malaria is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes that kills thousands of people worldwide.
Artemisinin‐based combination treatments are strongly advocated, but uncertainty about their availability (and cost) remains a major concern.
The review includes four small randomized controlled trials, all from Africa, comparing SP plus AS with SP plus AQ for treating uncomplicated malaria.
SP plus AQ performed better at destroying blood parasites at 28 days, although resistance to the drugs may have increased since the trials were performed.
Adverse events were poorly reported.
