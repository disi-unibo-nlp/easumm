Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV‐1 infection Using ART and chemotherapy together increases the likelihood of KS remission and reduces the risk of death in HIV‐infected children diagnosed with KS.
We found four observational studies that examined this question.
Overall, we found that, though data are sparse and not adequately statistically adjusted, ART and chemotherapy together compared to chemotherapy alone and ART and chemotherapy compared to ART alone increases the likelihood of KS remission and reduces the risk of death in HIV‐infected children diagnosed with KS.
The quality of this evidence is, however, weak.
Future clinical trials of KS treatment options in HIV‐infected children are needed.
