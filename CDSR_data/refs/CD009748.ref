Motivational interviewing for young people living with HIV Many young people are living with HIV.
Motivational interviewing is a specific way of counselling which has been shown to be beneficial in the general population.
It helps people adopt better health behaviours.
It is not certain whether it can help youth living with HIV.
We found two trials with a total of 237 participants which we included in this review.
Both trials report that motivational interviewing can help young people to use condoms more often, and also to reduce the amount of HIV in their blood stream.
One trial reports a reduction in alcohol use.
Motivational interviewing did not affect retention in care.
Some results of interest, like adherence to medication, number of deaths and quality of life were not reported by these trials, and should be reported in subsequent studies.
Additionally, all these studies were conducted in a high income country therefore these results cannot be applied to low income countries.
