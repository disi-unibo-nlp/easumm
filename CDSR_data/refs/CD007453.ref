Interventions for treatment of neonatal hyperglycemia in very low birth weight infants Higher‐than‐normal blood sugar levels are frequently seen in babies born very early (before 32 weeks gestation) or with very low birth weight (< 1500 grams) and who are fed totally or partially by vein.
Several types of adverse outcomes have been associated with high blood sugar levels, including increased risks for death, infections, eye problems, and bleeding into the brain.
It is not known if treatment to lower the baby's blood sugar helps to prevent those complications and, if so, which treatment is best.
These treatment options include decreasing the amount of sugar delivered by vein to nourish the baby or administration of insulin.
This review of trials found no evidence of significant effects of these treatments on the risks of death or major complications.
However, the studies reviewed were very small.
There is a need for larger trials to answer these questions.
