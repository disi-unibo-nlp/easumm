Evidence for the efficacy of piracetam for dementia or cognitive impairment is inadequate for clinical use but sufficient to justify further research Piracetam was one of the first drugs used for dementia and comes from the class of drugs called nootropics, whose putative actions are still poorly defined.
Most of the trials of piracetam were undertaken many years ago and did not use methods which would be currently considered standard.
Some of the studies suggested there may be some benefit from piracetam but overall the evidence is not consistent or positive enough to support its use for dementia or cognitive impairment.
