Early psychological interventions to treat acute traumatic stress symptoms Traumatic events can have a significant impact on individuals', families' and communities' abilities to cope.
In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties.
However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions and interventions provided to all have not been effective at preventing PTSD.
A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to reduce psychological distress for individuals exposed to trauma.
This review evaluated the results of 15 studies that tested a diverse range of psychological interventions aimed at treating acute traumatic stress problems.
There was evidence to support the use of trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy with such individuals, although there were a number of potential biases in identified studies which means the results should be treated with some caution.
Further research is required to evaluate longer terms effects of TF‚ÄêCBT, to explore potential benefits of other forms of intervention and to identify the most effective ways of providing psychological help in the early stages after a traumatic event.
