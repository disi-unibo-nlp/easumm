Modest salt reduction lowers blood pressure in all ethnic groups at all levels of blood pressure without adverse consequences The public health recommendations in most countries are to reduce salt intake from the current levels of approximately 9‐12 grams per day to less than 5‐6 grams per day.
Our pooled analysis of randomised trials of 4 weeks or more in duration shows that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure both in individuals with raised blood pressure and in those with normal blood pressure.
The fall in blood pressure is shown in both whites and blacks, men and women.
Additionally, our results show that a longer‐term modest reduction in salt intake has no adverse effect on hormone and lipid levels.
These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake.
This will likely lower population blood pressure and reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.
Furthermore, our results are consistent with the fact that the lower the salt intake, the lower the blood pressure.
The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5‐6 grams per day will lower blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 grams per day will lower blood pressure more.
Therefore, 3 grams per day should become the long‐term target for population salt intake.
