Metalloporphyrins for treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates Metalloporphyrins may reduce very high levels of jaundice in newborn babies, but more research is required on safety and to compare it with other treatments.
Jaundice is very common in newborn babies, and is caused by the liver producing too much bilirubin, a yellow‐coloured bile substance.
A very high level of bilirubin can damage the developing brain, and is treated with phototherapy (light therapy) or exchange transfusions.
Metalloporphyrins are drugs that can prevent the formation of bilirubin, but they might also cause photosensitivity (sensitivity to light) and anaemia (decreased hemoglobin levels in the blood).
The review of trials found some evidence that metalloporphyrins might be able to reduce bilirubin, but more research is needed on short and long‐term effects and to compare it with other treatments.
