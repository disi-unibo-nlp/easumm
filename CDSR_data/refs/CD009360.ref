Inspiratory muscle training for the recovery of function after stroke Inspiratory muscle training involves the training of specific muscles including diaphragmatic muscles and external intercostal muscles.
When these muscles contract, they act to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, which forces air into the lungs.
Routine training of inspiratory muscles is performed using a training device that gives the participants an inhale resistance set according to their endurance or maximal inspiratory pressure during inspiration.
Inspiratory muscle training aimed to improve the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles, which has shown possible effects for functional recovery after stroke.
The authors found two small heterogeneous randomised trials that investigated the effect of inspiratory muscle training.
These studies do not provide enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the effect of inspiratory muscle training for patients with stroke.
There is also no evidence relating to the safety of inspiratory muscle training.
Future well‚Äêdesigned studies are needed.
