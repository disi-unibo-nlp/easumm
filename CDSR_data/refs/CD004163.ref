Identification (through screening) of children in the first four years of life for early treatment for otitis media with effusion (OME) Otitis media with effusion (OME ‚Äê also known as 'glue ear') is a common condition in children, where sticky fluid accumulates in the middle ear.
Although the fluid usually resolves without treatment, it may remain and cause long periods of hearing loss.
This may lead to problems with language development and behaviour.
Children with OME may show no other symptoms so some have suggested that all children should be checked (screened) for this condition.
However, the review of trials in the developed world found that checking children for, and early treatment of, OME before they are four does not result in improved outcomes.
