Levomepromazine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in people with advanced disease This is an update of the review published in 2013.
Nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick) are common and unpleasant symptoms that are often experienced by people with advanced disease.
There are several different drug therapies which are available to treat these symptoms, known as antiemetics.
Levomepromazine was originally used to treat schizophrenia but is also used to control nausea and vomiting.
It can be given as a tablet or as an injection.
In February 2015, we were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials investigating whether levomepromazine is an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in patients receiving palliative care.
There is a need for randomised studies to find out which drugs are the most effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in these patients.
In the updated review we identified one ongoing study which aims to assess how well levomepromazine improves nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer.
