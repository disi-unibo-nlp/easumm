Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for primary dysmenorrhoea High‐frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.
Dysmenorrhoea is a very common complaint that refers to painful menstrual cramps in the uterus.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) involves the sending of an electric current by placing electrodes on the skin to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain.
It is thought to alter the body's ability to receive and understand pain signals rather than by having a direct effect on the uterine contractions.
The review of trials found that high‐frequency TENS may help but there is not enough evidence to assess the effect of low‐frequency TENS.
More research is needed.
