Prostanoids for intermittent claudication Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of lower limb ischaemia that results from peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
It is evident as muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue) in the leg muscles that occurs during exercise and is relieved by a short period of rest.
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostacyclin (PGI2), also known as prostanoids, are vasoactive drugs used in PAD to reduce arterial insufficiency.
The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of prostanoids in patients with IC.
We identified 18 randomised studies with a total of 2773 participants, of which four studies compared the effects of PGE1 versus placebo.
Overall, there was insufficient high quality evidence to suggest that PGE1 improves walking distances in people with IC.
There was also a lack of evidence to determine if PGE1 was more effective than laevadosin, naftidrofuryl or L‚Äêarginine.
Evidence on the efficacy of prostacyclin was inconclusive.
Results suggest that, compared with PGE1, prostacyclin may be associated with an increased occurrence of side effects including headache, diarrhoea and facial flushing.
