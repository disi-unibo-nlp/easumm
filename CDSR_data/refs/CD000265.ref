Compression bandages and stockings to help the healing of venous leg ulcers Venous leg ulcers can occur when blood returning from veins in the legs to the heart is slow or obstructed.
These ulcers can take a long time to heal (weeks or months) and can cause distress to patients, as well as being very costly to the health service.
Compression bandages help blood to return to the heart from the legs, and there are a variety of types of bandage systems available; some are just a single bandage, while others require the application of several different types of bandages to the leg.
Compression stockings are sometimes used as an alternative to compression bandages.
This review examined the effectiveness of compression bandages versus no compression, and compared different types of compression bandages and stockings.
We looked at how well these different treatments work in terms of ulcer healing.
We found that applying compression was better than not using compression, and that multi‐component bandages worked better than single‐component systems.
Multi‐component systems (bandages or stockings) appear to perform better when one part is an elastic (stretchy) bandage.
A very detailed analysis showed that a system called the 'four‐layer bandage' or '4LB' (i.e.
four different bandages applied to the leg, including an elastic one) heals ulcers faster than the 'short‐stretch bandage' or 'SSB' (a type of bandage with very minimal stretch).
