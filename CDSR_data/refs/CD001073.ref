D‐Penicillamine for preventing retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease of premature infants that continues to be a serious problem.
The drug D‐penicillamine, given by mouth, is commonly used to treat poisoning by iron or copper or other heavy metals.
In research studies of D‐penicillamine used for another problem that premature infants have (high bilirubin), it was observed that the treated infants had less ROP.
However, this systematic review did not show any significant benefits of this drug for the outcomes of ROP, death or development of nerves.
Thus, the use of this drug cannot be recommended for the prevention of ROP based on available evidence.
