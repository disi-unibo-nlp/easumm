Benzopyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs Lymphoedema is an accumulation of excess fluid, mainly in the arms and legs.
It can occur in several ways: from birth; as a result of a parasitic infection; or as a complication of cancer surgery.
The most common treatments are compression hosiery (e.g.
bandaging, sleeves, etc.
), skin care and exercise.
The drugs commonly known as benzo‐pyrones have been prescribed to prevent the fluid leakage and collection which characterises lymphoedema.
This review found that there was not enough good quality evidence to draw conclusions about whether benzo‐pyrones are useful either in reducing lymphoedema or the pain and discomfort associated with it.
