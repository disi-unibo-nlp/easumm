Does use of an electronic health record improve the delivery of stop smoking treatment to patients?
In many countries a large investment is being made in technology to computerize patient medical records.
One potential of electronic health records (EHR) is that they could be used to remind doctors and other clinic staff to record tobacco use, to give brief advice to quit, to prescribe medications and to refer to stop smoking counselling.
They could also help refer people to these services and be used to measure how well a clinic was doing.
EHRs could also help make the delivery of tobacco use treatments standard practice by providing electronic referrals for additional treatment services (e.g., referral to a telephone tobacco quit line).
We included 16 studies in this review, nine of which were observational studies so were lower quality than randomized controlled trials.
Of the recommended actions for doctors with tobacco using patients we found only modest improvements associated with the EHR changes.
Specifically, documentation of tobacco use and referral to cessation counselling appear to increase following EHR changes.
However, these studies did not test for and/or demonstrate an increase in the number of people who quit smoking.
