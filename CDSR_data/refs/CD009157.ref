Tiotropium versus long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists (LABAs) in the management of COPD Tiotropium is an inhaled medication that helps open the airways (bronchodilator) and is used to manage persistent symptoms of COPD.
We found seven studies including 12,223 participants that compared tiotropium with long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists (LABAs), which are another type of bronchodilator.
This systematic review found that currently there is insufficient evidence to suggest which of these treatments provides greater long‐term benefit in quality of life.
Furthermore, both treatments had similar effects on symptoms, lung function and death rates.
Tiotropium appears better than LABAs in preventing COPD exacerbations (worsening of COPD symptoms) and reducing the number of COPD‐related hospitalisations.
Furthermore, there were fewer participants during the study period with serious adverse events or who withdrew early from the studies with tiotropium compared with LABA treatment.
However, there was no difference in the total number of people who were hospitalised.
We found six economic evaluations looking at the cost and effectiveness of tiotropium and the LABA salmeterol that were conducted in the UK, Greece, Netherlands, Spain, or USA.
All the studies estimated tiotropium to be better than salmeterol based on medical outcomes (exacerbations or quality of life) and/or lower total costs, including respiratory medications and hospitalisations.
However, these results were very uncertain.
