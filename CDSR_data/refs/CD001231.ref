Ambulatory versus conventional methods for monitoring blood pressure during pregnancy Not enough evidence to show whether wearing a blood pressure monitoring device for 24 hours during pregnancy is better at detecting hypertension than clinic tests.
High blood pressure (hypertension), when associated with protein in the urine (pre‐eclampsia), can lead to serious complications during pregnancy.
Measuring and monitoring blood pressure has therefore been a central feature of pregnancy care.
However, the value of one‐off measurements at a clinic visit have been questioned.
Blood pressure measurement devices have been developed which the woman wears during her normal activities.
These take several measurements, usually over a 24‐hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring).
The review of trials found there was no evidence to assess the effects of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during pregnancy.
