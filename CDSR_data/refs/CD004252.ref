Muscle relaxants for non‐specific low‐back pain Muscle relaxants are effective for short‐term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low back pain.
However, the incidence of drowsiness, dizziness and other side effects is high.
Muscle relaxants must be used with caution and it must be left to the discretion of the physician to weigh the pros and cons and to determine whether or not a specific patient is a suitable candidate for a course of muscle relaxants.
Large high quality trials are needed that directly compare muscle relaxants to analgesics or NSAIDs and future studies should focus on reducing the incidence and severity of side effects.
