Medicines to prevent vestibular migraine Review question Which medicines are effective for preventing vestibular migraine?
Background Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine in which the main symptoms relate to dizziness and the balance system.
It is a common problem, known to affect 1% of the general population and possibly more because it is thought to be under diagnosed.
There is still no agreement on which is the best treatment available to prevent attacks of vestibular migraine.
Study characteristics We found only one ongoing study on this topic.
This study is investigating a beta‚Äêblocker (metoprolol) compared with a placebo (sham treatment).
Key results We identified no completed randomised controlled trials that met the review inclusion criteria.
Results of the ongoing study are awaited.
Recruitment of the last patient is expected by the end of 2016.
The evidence in this review is current to June 2015.
