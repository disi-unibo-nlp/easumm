Clozapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review compared the clinical effects of clozapine with the other atypical antipsychotics.
Twenty‚Äêseven studies fulfilled the review's criteria and provided data to compare clozapine with antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and zotepine.
Clozapine was somewhat more efficacious than zotepine.
Also, inefficacy of treatment led more frequently to leaving the studies early in the risperidone group suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine.
The principal drawback of clozapine were its adverse effects which lead to significantly higher numbers of participants leaving the studies early compared to olanzapine and risperidone.
Clozapine was associated with more sedation and hypersalivation than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone and with more seizures than olanzapine and risperidone.
There was a higher incidence of white blood cell decrease in clozapine groups than olanzapine and more weight gain than in risperidone groups.
On the other hand clozapine produced fewer movement disorder than risperidone and less prolactin increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and zotepine.
