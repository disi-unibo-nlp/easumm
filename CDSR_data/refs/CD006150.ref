Adjunctive corticosteroids for  Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia in patients with HIV infection Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP), formerly called  Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia, is the most common opportunistic infection among patients infected with HIV.
In 1990, based on evidence from five randomised controlled trials, an expert panel recommended the use of corticosteroids for HIV‐infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood).
The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of adjunctive (additional) corticosteroids on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients co‐infected with HIV and PCP.
We searched for eligible studies up to April 2014.
We included seven studies in this review and six in the meta‐analysis (combining of study data).
The number and size of the trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV‐infected patients co‐infected with PCP is small (the six trials included in the meta‐analysis comprised 242 individuals in the intervention groups and 247 individuals in the control groups; the trial on infants comprised 47 individuals in the intervention group and 53 in the control group).
Follow‐up ranged from three to 14 months.
The evidence from this review was of high quality for mortality and of moderate quality for need for mechanical ventilation and suggests a beneficial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia.
For infants (18 months or younger) with HIV and suspected PCP there is insufficient evidence on whether the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids could improve survival (the confidence interval for the estimate of effect is wide, includes both clinically relevant benefit and harm and is of moderate quality).
