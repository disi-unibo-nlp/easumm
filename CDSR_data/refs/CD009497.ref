Electrocoagulation for liver metastases Can electrocoagulation (high‐frequency electrical current) applied locally destroy cancer spread to the liver?
Background When cancer spreads to other sites in the body, one of the most common sites is the liver.
Besides cancer of the liver (primary, or original liver cancer), liver metastases (new cancers that develop in parts of the body besides the original cancer) from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver.
More than half of the people whose cancer spread to the liver die from complications.
Metastases in the liver can be destroyed using several different methods; one of these is electrocoagulation by diathermy.
This method requires that a special electrode be placed in or near the cancer site.
The electrode is used to transmit high‐frequency electrical currents, which generate high temperatures.
This causes the proteins within the tissue to coagulate, or clot, thereby destroying it.
The electrode is positioned by cutting into the abdomen with a laparotomy (open surgery) or a laparoscopy (keyhole surgery).
Methods We looked for randomised clinical trials that assessed the effect of electrocoagulation by diathermy, administered alone or with another intervention, versus no intervention, or any other treatment, in people with cancer of any location that had spread to the liver.
We looked at the effect of electrocoagulation on the risk of death, quality of life, adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention), time to death, failure to clear liver metastases or recurrence of liver metastases, time to progression of liver metastases, and tumour response.
Study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 6 October 2020.
We only identified one randomised clinical trial.
The trial allocated participants at random to four intervention groups: electrocoagulation (use of diathermy) alone; electrocoagulation plus dimethyl sulphoxide; electrocoagulation plus allopurinol; versus a control group, which only received a solution of allopurinol by mouth.
The treatment was started on the fifth day after surgical removal of the sigmoid colon (last section of the bowel), and participants were followed for five years.
The trial included 306 participants, but data were only collected on 223 participants.
Key results On the basis of one randomised clinical trial, at high risk of bias and few participants, we found insufficient evidence to detect whether electrocoagulation by diathermy alone, compared with a solution of allopurinol (control), made a difference in risk of death and post‐operative death for people with liver metastases from colon cancer; electrocoagulation in combination with allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide may slightly decrease the risk of death compared with the control intervention, but the evidence is also insufficient and uncertain.
It is very uncertain if there is a difference in post‐operative death between the electrocoagulation combined with allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide group versus the control intervention.
The data on other adverse events and complications, recurrence of liver metastases, time to progression of liver metastases, tumour response, and health‐related quality of life were either lacking or insufficient for analysis.
Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of low to very low certainty because the trial was not properly performed, putting it at high risk of bias regarding the reliability of the obtained data.
The trial included a relatively small number of participants and it described overall few events.
The reported results were insufficient as only few outcomes of interest to people with liver metastases and their doctors were reported.
Electrocoagulation by diathermy is no longer used in the way it is described in the trial as it has been replaced by other techniques.
This could be a reason for the lack of further trials.
