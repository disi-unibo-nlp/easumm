Intrarectal quinine versus intravenous or intramuscular quinine for treating  Plasmodium falciparum  malaria Quinine given through the rectum may be as effective as intravenous and intramuscular quinine for treating uncomplicated  Plasmodium falciparum  malaria.
The data reviewed also lead to the conclusion that a diluted proprietary quinine solution (made less acidic by adjustment to a pH of 4.5) given intrarectally using a syringe for two to three days has less harmful effects compared with intramuscular quinine given for the same time period.
Administration of intrarectal quinine (made less acidic by adjustment to a pH of 4.5) is significantly less painful than intramuscular injection of quinine.
More trials are needed for patients with severe malaria and in adults.
