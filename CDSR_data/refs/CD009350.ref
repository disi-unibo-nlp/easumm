Dietary flavonoid for preventing colorectal neoplasms Eight studies with 390,769 participants, mainly observational, were included in this systematic review.
The aim of the studies reviewed was to determine an association of the intake of total flavonoids, and eight main flavonoid subclasses, with colorectal neoplasms including CRC and adenomas.
The majority of the studies were of medium to high methodological quality.
The evidence that intake of dietary flavonoids reduces the risk of colorectal neoplasms was conflicting, and could partly be explained due to difficulties in quantifying the intake of flavonoids.
Therefore, the association of dietary flavonoids and prevention of colorectal neoplasms remains unproven.
