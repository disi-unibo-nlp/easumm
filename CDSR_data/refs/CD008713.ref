Lamivudine with or without adefovir dipivoxil for postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common types of cancer.
Surgical resection is considered the first‚Äêline therapy in early HCC, relapse is the main postoperative problem.
A large proportion of participants with HCC have hepatitis B virus infection.
Lamivudine with or without adefovir dipivoxil are considered effective and tolerable for chronic hepatitis B by suppressing the viral load and to reduce fibrosis in the liver, and are widely used as adjuvant therapy postoperatively.
As yet, there is no evidence that lamivudine with or without adefovir dipivoxil is effective or not for postoperative HCC.
The authors found no randomised clinical trials that could be included in the present review.
Hence, no conclusions could be drawn.
