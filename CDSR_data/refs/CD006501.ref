The role of prophylactic immunoglobulins in hematological malignancies Patients with hematological malignancies are prone to infections due to defects in their immune system.
One of the main defects is a reduction in the level of immunoglobulins.
For many years, the notion was that administration of pooled immunoglobulins from healthy donors might reverse this defect.
However, randomized controlled trials showed different results in terms of prolongation of survival, reduction of infections and side effects of treatments.
We conducted a systematic review assessing the role of administration of immunoglobulins from healthy donors as prophylaxis in patients with hematological malignancies.
Our review showed that in the context of bone marrow transplantation the administration of immunoglobulins did not have an effect on survival or other outcomes.
On the other hand, in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders like chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma, it reduced substantially the rate of infections.
Despite their high cost, prophylactic immunoglobulins might prove cost‚Äêeffective in this population.
