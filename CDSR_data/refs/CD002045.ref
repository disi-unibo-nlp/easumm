More evidence needed as to the best concentration of crystalloid to use in resuscitation fluids Fluid resuscitation is usually given when a patient has lost a lot of blood, but there is continuing uncertainty as to the best sort of fluid to use.
Some of the fluids used contain substances classified as "crystalloids", but should the concentration of crystalloids in the fluid be about the same as their concentration in human blood ("isotonic") or higher ("hypertonic")?
It is commonly believed that hypertonic crystalloid is the more effective at increasing blood volume but that there could be some disadvantages to using it.
This review has assessed the evidence from studies that compared the use of the two types of fluid with patients who had been injured or burned, or were having surgery.
Not enough evidence is available, however, to decide which crystalloid concentration is best.
More research is needed.
