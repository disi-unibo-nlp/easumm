Back schools for non‐specific low‐back pain There is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools are more effective for pain and function than other conservative treatments if the patients with chronic low‐back pain (LBP) are from the general public, primary or secondary care.
There is conflicting evidence whether back schools are more effective than placebo or waiting list controls for pain, function and return‐to‐work.
There is moderate evidence suggesting that back schools, in an occupational setting, reduce pain, and improve function and return‐to‐work status, in the short and intermediate‐term, compared to exercises, manipulation, myofascial therapy or advice, placebo or waiting list controls, for patients with chronic LBP.
