Complementary treatments such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs for bedwetting in children Night‚Äêtime bedwetting is common in childhood, and can cause stigma, stress and inconvenience.
Alarms offer the best chance of cure, and desmopressin may be used to reduce or stop wet nights during treatment.
Simple behavioural methods such as rewards also help, especially as first line treatment.
People often use complementary methods to treat their children, but the review of trials did not provide good evidence to support this.
There was no reliable information comparing complementary methods with established effective methods such as alarms and desmopressin.
Further research is needed.
