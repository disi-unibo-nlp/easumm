The COMT inhibitors entacapone and tolcapone show similar benefits in relieving levodopa‐induced complications in Parkinson's disease but more data on the safety of tolcapone is required.
As Parkinson's disease progresses the control of the symptoms often requires the addition of other drugs to levodopa.
The principle aim of COMT inhibitor therapy is to increase the duration of effect of each levodopa dose and thus reduce the time patients spend in the relatively immobile 'off' phase.
Tolcapone and entacapone can be used to reduce off time, reduce levodopa dose, and modestly improve motor impairment and disability.
This is based on, at best, medium term evidence.
However some participants on tolcapone had raised liver enzymes.
Post‐marketing surveillance identified three cases of fatal hepatic toxicity in patients treated with tolcapone.
As a result, tolcapone has been withdrawn from some countries and severe restrictions on its use have been imposed in others.
