Unwanted hair removal by laser systems and intense pulsed light sources Unwanted hair growth is a challenge and considerable resources are spent to achieve a hair‐free appearance.
Hair removal with laser devices (alexandrite, diode, neodymium:YAG, and ruby lasers) and intense pulsed light are widespread methods for hair removal although the long‐term effect is uncertain.
Eleven randomised controlled trials were included in the review, none of which were of high quality.
A large number of trials were excluded, mainly because of their non‐randomised designs.
There appeared to be a short‐term effect of approximately 50% hair reduction with alexandrite and diode lasers up to six months after treatment, whereas there was little evidence for an effect with intense pulsed light, neodymium:YAG or ruby lasers.
Long‐term hair removal was not recorded for any treatment.
Infrequently reported adverse effects were pain, skin redness, swelling, burned hairs and pigmentary changes.
