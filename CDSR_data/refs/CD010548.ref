High frequency jet ventilation versus high frequency oscillatory ventilation for pulmonary dysfunction in preterm infants Background:  Breathing difficulty due to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is one of the major causes of death in babies born prematurely.
Breathing machines providing what is known as conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), which is currently used to support these babies, potentially contribute to longer‚Äêterm lung injury known as chronic lung disease (CLD).
CLD occurs frequently in preterm babies who require breathing machines, and the type of breathing machine used may affect whether CLD occurs.
Two new types of breathing machines (known as high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)) have been tested in the hope that these methods of breathing support might reduce lung injury (CLD).
Our review question:  In preterm infants (born before term) at risk for or having RDS, we planned to compare the risks and benefits of two modes of breathing machines: HFJV and HFOV.
What the studies showed:  We identified no studies that compared these two modes of breathing support.
Overall:  This review found no evidence for comparison of the superiority or harmful side effects of HFJV over HFOV, or of HFOV over HFJV, in infants at risk for or having breathing difficulty due to RDS.
