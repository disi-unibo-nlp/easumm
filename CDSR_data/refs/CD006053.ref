Comparison of the stomach‐preserving versus classic 'Whipple' operation for people with cancer of the pancreas or the periampullary region Review question It is unclear whether the pylorus‐preserving Whipple procedure results in a higher rate of recurrence of the tumour because it is less extensive and therefore may be less radical, but it is also unknown whether quality of life is decreased after removal of the lower portion of the stomach.
Another uncertainty is whether the two methods are associated with different rates or types of complications.
Background Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.
Two surgical procedures can lead to a cure: the classic Whipple operation, in which part of the pancreas, the gallbladder, the duodenum, the pylorus (outlet of the stomach), and the distal (lower) part of the stomach are removed, and the so‐called pylorus‐preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, or pylorus‐preserving Whipple operation, in which the stomach and the pylorus are not removed.
Study characteristics We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 512 participants in this review.
The included trials revealed vast differences in sample size as well as clinical and methodological quality.
Key results We could identify no relevant differences in terms of main complications, long‐term survival, or death due to complications after the operation, but operating time, intraoperative blood loss, and need for blood transfusion seem to be less frequent in the group treated with the pylorus‐preserving Whipple operation.
Our conclusion is that, at present, no relevant difference is evident between the two surgical procedures for the treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancer.
Quality of the evidence The quality of the body of evidence is still low since all trials revealed some shortcomings in terms of methodological quality or reporting.
