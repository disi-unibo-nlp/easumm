The use of the anticoagulant heparin to reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (i.e.
bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants Review question:  Does heparin reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (i.e.
bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants?
Background:  Heparin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors.
On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as heparin may reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and progression of intraventricular haemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates.
This systematic review synthesises the available evidence on the effectiveness of heparin in preventing intraventricular haemorrhage in very preterm neonates.
Study characteristics:  We included two trials for a total of 155 very preterm newborn infants comparing low‚Äêdose heparin with the same solution without heparin.
Results:  The use of heparin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to solution without heparin.
Conclusions : The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of heparin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.
