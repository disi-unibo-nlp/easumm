Alternative dosing strategies for intravenous antibiotics to treat severe infections Intravenous (through the vein) antibiotics are used to treat severe bacterial infections.
Currently, the most common way to administer intravenous antibiotics is by intermittent infusion, whereby an antibiotic is infused into a patient over 30 minutes to 1 hour multiple times per day during the course of treatment.
To optimise the efficacy and potentially the safety of these antibiotics, alternative dosing strategies have been studied.
One proposed strategy is to administer intravenous antibiotics by continuous or extended infusions over 3 to 24 hours.
Twenty–nine randomised trials comprising more than 1600 participants were reviewed to study the effects of continuous infusion antibiotics versus intermittent infusion antibiotics.
When mortality, infection recurrence, clinical cure, super‐infection after treatment, and safety concerns were considered, no differences between the two dosing strategies were noted.
The authors conclude that because continuous antibiotic infusions provide no benefit over standard intermittent infusions, they cannot recommend continuous antibiotic infusions for widespread use.
