Orthodontic and orthopaedic treatment for anterior open bite in children Interventions were able to correct anterior open bite but this was based on data from two studies that have problems in their quality.
Open bite is characterised by a lack of vertical overlap of the upper and lower incisors.
This problem has several possible causes such as mouth breathing, sucking habits, alteration of development of jaw and maxilla.
It can make speech, swallowing, mastication and aesthetics difficult.
Several treatments have been used to correct anterior open bite.
The review authors evaluated three studies with the following treatments: Frankel's function regulator‐4 (FR‐4) with lip‐seal training, palatal crib with chincup, and repelling‐magnet splints versus bite‐blocks.
This last study could not be analysed because the author interrupted the treatment earlier than planned due to side effects.
