Interventions for treating phosphorus burns Phosphorus is a chemical element sometimes used in a military or industrial context.
Phosphorus burns resulting from military or industrial injuries are chemical burns that can be fatal.
Although rare, these burns are serious, often very deep and painful, and can be associated with lengthy periods of time in hospital for patients.
The usual procedure for dealing with phosphorus burns is to remove any affected clothing and wash the wounds with water or saline solution.
In addition, copper sulphate can be used to make the particles of phosphorus  more visible and easier to remove, however, copper sulphate is poisonous and can in itself be fatal if absorbed into the body.
This review found two retrospective studies (88 patients) that compared burns treated with or without copper sulphate.
The review found no evidence that using copper sulphate improves the outcome of the burn, indeed, based upon the limited available evidence, the review authors suggest that copper sulphate should not be used in the treatment of phosphorus burns.
No other studies were identified that could be used to assess other treatments for this type of burn.
