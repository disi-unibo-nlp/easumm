Preoxygenation for tracheal suctioning in intubated, ventilated newborn infants There is not enough evidence to demonstrate the effects of giving oxygen before tracheal suctioning for preterm babies receiving mechanical ventilation.
A baby born too early (before 34 weeks gestation) often has immature lungs.
This is a major cause of breathing failure and death.
Mechanical ventilation (machine assisted breathing) keeps the baby breathing and reduces the risk of lung injury and disease.
Endotracheal suctioning (removing unwanted fluid through the windpipe) is a routine part of mechanical ventilation, but can have serious complications such as pneumothorax (air in the lung cavity) and bradycardia (slow heart rate).
Giving oxygen just before suctioning (preoxygenation) may minimise the risk of these complications.
The review of trials did not find enough evidence on the effects of preoxygenation.
More research is needed.
