Antipsychotic drugs for non‐affective psychosis during pregnancy and postpartum Women who suffer with psychotic conditions who become pregnant are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs.
The risks of harm to the offspring associated with exposure to these drugs, in utero or through breast‐feeding, are unknown.
We aimed to find good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials on the risks and benefits of antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding for both the woman and the foetus/infant.
We found none.
Ethical constraints concerning randomisation of treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the logistics of such a study and a lack of impetus from the pharmaceutical industry in this area may explain the lack of research.
However, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in these women during pregnancy and lactation without sound evidence raises serious clinical and ethical concerns.
