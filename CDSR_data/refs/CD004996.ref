No evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements for patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterised by fatty deposition in the hepatocytes in the absence of excessive alcohol intake and of other known causes of fatty liver.
Hepatic injury might be improved by antioxidant supplements.
This systematic review identified six randomised clinical trials.
No liver‐related or unrelated deaths occurred in any of the included trials.
Adverse events were minor and non‐specific.
Treatment with antioxidant supplements showed a significant, though not clinically relevant, amelioration of aspartate aminotransferase, but not of alanine aminotransferase, as compared to placebo or other interventions.
Data on the radiological and/or histological response were too limited to draw any conclusions.
Further placebo‐controlled trials are necessary.
