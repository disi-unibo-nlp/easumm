The use of retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) to prevent progression of cervical intra‐epithelial neoplasia (CIN) Cervical cancer is preceded by cervical intra‐epithelial neoplasia (CIN).
Surgery for CIN is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma.
An effective chemo‐preventive agent might avoid the need for surgery and reduce the cost and morbidity of work‐up and treatment.
Retinoids are natural and synthetic derivatives of naturally occurring vitamin A.
Overall, the retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of severe CIN3 but may have activity in moderate CIN2.
Data are inadequate to allow assessment of whether the retinoids studied are effective in preventing progression of any grade of CIN.
