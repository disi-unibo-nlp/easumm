Use of noninvasive ventilation (a mask ventilator) holds promise as a method to make it easier to remove adults from conventional ventilators.
Patients with acute respiratory failure frequently require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (invasive positive‐pressure ventilation) to sustain life.
Complications of mechanical ventilation include respiratory muscle weakness, upper airway injury, ventilator‐associated pneumonia, sinusitis and associated death.
For these reasons, it is important to minimize the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Noninvasive positive‐pressure ventilation is achieved with an oronasal, nasal or total face mask connected to a positive‐pressure ventilator and does not require an indwelling artificial airway.
Results from 16 randomized controlled trials, predominantly of moderate to good quality, involving 994 selected participants, approximately two thirds with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had respiratory failure and were starting to breathe spontaneously, demonstrate that support with noninvasive ventilation can decrease death, weaning failure, pneumonia and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital.
Noninvasive weaning also decreased the total duration of ventilation and the time spent on invasive ventilation, as well as the number of participants who received a tracheostomy.
Although noninvasive weaning had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation related to weaning, it did not increase the reintubation rate.
Insufficient data were available to assess its impact on quality of life.
Noninvasive weaning significantly reduced mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies versus mixed population studies.
