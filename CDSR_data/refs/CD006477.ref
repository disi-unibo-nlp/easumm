Flavonoids for treating venous leg ulcers Venous leg ulcers (which appear as open sores) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the legs.
Compression of the leg, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), is known to help heal venous ulcers.
Flavonoids, which are commonly used as food supplements, occur in a variety of plant‚Äêbased foods and beverages, including cocoas, chocolates, teas and red wines.
They are sometimes used to try to promote ulcer healing in the leg.
This review of clinical trials concluded that there is some evidence to show that flavonoids can help heal venous leg ulcers, however, many trials were not reported well, and we could not know for certain whether the apparently beneficial effects were real or not.
This meant that we could not draw firm conclusions, or recommend routine use of flavonoids for people with leg ulcers.
Larger and better conducted trials are needed to assess the true clinical effect of flavonoids.
