No evidence of benefit of Acetyl‐l‐carnitine for dementia Acetyl‐l‐carnitine (ALC) is derived from carnitine and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial in dementia.
Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects.
However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings.
The early and later studies differ widely in methodology and assessment tools used, and are therefore difficult to compare.
There is no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of cognition, severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure.
An apparent beneficial effect on Clinical Global Impression assessed as a dichotomous variable may be due to chance.
There was also a significant treatment effect on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 weeks, but this result must be interpreted with caution in the context of significant heterogeneity in these trials.
ALC is not currently in routine clinical use.
