Spina bifida repair and infant and maternal health Spina bifida is the term used to describe a group of neural tube conditions where the fetal spinal cord does not close properly during the first month of pregnancy.
With open spina bifida some of the vertebrae are not completely formed but are split or divided and the spinal cord and its coverings (the meninges) protrude through the opening.
The most severe is where the spinal cord and meninges come out of the child's back (myelomeningocele).
Open spina bifida is often associated with hindbrain herniation, where the cerebellum and brainstem tissue extend into the large opening in the base of the skull, and hydrocephalus (enlargement of the fluid filled cavities in the brain).
Resulting disabilities include bladder and bowel incontinence, difficulties in moving about due to limb weakness, paralysis, deformity and loss of sensation.
Conventional treatment of spina bifida is surgical repair within two days of birth, which may include the placement of a shunt between the ventricles of the baby’s brain and the belly (peritoneum) to relieve hydrocephalus.
Spina bifida can be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasound or maternal serum alpha‐feto protein and in utero treatment could improve outcomes; although it involves surgical incision into the mother’s abdomen and uterus to access the unborn baby.
This review aimed to compare the effects of in utero repair versus repair as a newborn.
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 158 women who were from 19 to 27 weeks pregnant with a baby with severe spina bifida and evidence of hindbrain herniation.
For neonatal mortality, there was no clear difference identified for prenatal versus postnatal repair.
However, the numbers of neonates who died were low and so the review was likely underpowered to detect any difference.
Prenatal repair was associated with reduced need for shunt placement and a reduction in the risk of moderate to severe hindbrain herniation after birth.
No direct complications of the repair procedure were evident, including orthopaedic deformities.
Prenatal repair was associated with an increased risk of the women experiencing preterm ruptured membranes and subsequent preterm birth (both before 34 and 37 weeks).
Severe maternal illness (infection and need for blood transfusion) were not clearly different; although the review was underpowered to detect any difference in these important, less common outcomes.
The included trial was of high quality (low risk of bias) but included a small number of pregnancies.
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend in utero repair for unborn babies with spina bifida.
