When is the best time to start antiretroviral therapy in children 2 to 5 years old who have HIV infection?
Antiretroviral combination therapy (cART) has been shown to be effective in slowing down the progression of AIDS and in reducing HIV‐related illnesses and death.
In infants and children who are diagnosed with HIV infection and are below two years of age the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that cART should be started immediately.
In children aged 2 to 5 years the WHO 2010 recommendations stated that treatment should be started when the body’s defence system has started to weaken (as indicated by a decline in a child’s CD4 cell count) or complications have occurred.
This systematic review was undertaken to help inform the 2013 WHO guidelines which aimed to revise the recommendations of when to start therapy in 2 to 5 years old children.
The authors identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immediate with deferred initiation of cART in HIV‐positive children aged 1 to 12 years in Thailand or Cambodia.
Additional analyses of 122 children enrolled in the two studies at ages 2 to 5 years were made available for this review.
A cohort study from South Africa in HIV‐positive children (median age 3.5 years) starting tuberculosis treatment and ART was also included.
Results showed that we still lack enough evidence to determine whether early or late initiation of cART is best in children aged 2 to 5 years.
The authors recognized the lack of evidence but highlighted the potential value of simplifying WHO recommendations to start cART in all children below five years with the goal of providing programmatic advantage to treatment programmes in resource‐limited settings.
