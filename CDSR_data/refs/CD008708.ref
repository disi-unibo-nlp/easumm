Transplantation of blood‐forming stem cells for people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia Review question We reviewed whether different types of stem cell transplantation are safe and effective in people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia.
Background Thalassaemia is a disorder that occurs because of a mutation in either the α‐ or β‐globin genes causing decreased production of haemoglobin (a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and increased destruction of red blood cells.
Decreased production of haemoglobin and destruction of red blood cells leads to anaemia and significant morbidity in affected individuals.
While anaemia can be treated effectively with regular blood transfusions, repeated transfusions lead to the accumulation of iron in the body, which unless treated with iron chelation can result in multiorgan disease particularly heart and lung.
These toxicities tend to accumulate over time leading to reduced quality of life and early death.
Additionally, blood transfusions do not provide a cure.
The use of hematopoietic (blood‐forming) stem cell transplantation involves replacing the unhealthy hematopoietic stem cells with normal hematopoietic stem cells from either a healthy donor (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) or genetically correcting the recipient's own cells and reinfusing them back into the individual (autologous gene therapy).
These stem cells then produce normal red blood cells containing normal amounts of globin chains and thus ameliorate anaemia.

Key results The review authors did not find any randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia.
