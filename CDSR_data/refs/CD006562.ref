5‐FU for genital warts in nonimmunocompromised individuals Genital warts is one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infection, with an estimated occurrence of about 32 million cases worldwide each year.
The warts affect the genital area and cause such symptoms as itching, burning, discomfort, pain, or bleeding with intercourse.
Because of the recurrence and the stigma associated with genital warts, frequently there are psychological burdens associated with the disease that possibly could become traumatic as feeling of shame, worry, fear, anger, and lowered self‐esteem develop.
Lesions can spread on one person and because they are easily spread between people, genital warts potentially can be a serious public health problem.
There are many options for treating genital warts, but none so far are superior to the others.
At this time, there is no available evidence that treatment efficiently eliminates genital warts or hinders its progression to malignancy.
This review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of topical 5‐FU for treatment of genital warts in nonimmunocompromised individuals.
Evidence from the studies we reviewed showed that 5‐FU had better results for cure than placebo or no treatment; MCSA; and Podophylin 2%, 4% or 25%.
No statistical difference was found when 5‐FU was compared with CO2 Laser treatment, and results were poor when 5‐FU was compared with 5‐FU + INFα‐2a (high dose) or 5‐FU + CO2 Laser INFα‐2a (high dose).
The weak point of this review was the great variability in the methods and quality of the studies that we included.
