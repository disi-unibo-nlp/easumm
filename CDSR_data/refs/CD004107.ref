Options for self‐management education for adults with asthma Guidelines for the treatment of asthma recommend that patients be educated about their condition, obtain regular medical review, monitor their condition at home with either peak flow or symptoms and use a written action plan.
This is known to improve health outcomes when compared to usual medical care.
A number of variations on optimal self‐management have now been described.
This review examines the efficacy of some of these options.
The results showed that self‐adjustment of medications according to a written action plan gave a similar improvement in health outcomes to adjustment of medications by a doctor.
Either symptom diaries or peak expiratory flow monitoring may be used for monitoring asthma and reducing the intensity of the education appears to dilute the effect.
