Psychological treatments for the management of irritable bowel syndrome In this review, the effectiveness of psychological therapies for adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome was evaluated.
Studies involving cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and relaxation therapy or stress management were reviewed.
Although it is difficult to draw conclusions because of differences between studies and quality issues, the results suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy may be effective immediately after finishing treatment.
It is unclear whether the effects of these therapies are sustained thereafter.
These results have to be interpreted with caution as the quality of the studies was sub‚Äêoptimal.
Physicians should be aware of the limitations of these therapies and should choose an appropriate therapy based on the individual patient's characteristics.
