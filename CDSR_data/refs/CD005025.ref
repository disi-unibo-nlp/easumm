Reminder packaging to help people take long‐term medications People often miss taking prescribed medication, because of forgetfulness, changing medication schedules or busy lifestyles.
It is estimated that between 40% and 60% of people do not take medication as prescribed, which can lead to worse health outcomes.
Packaging of medications with reminder systems for the day and/or time of the week is an attempt to help people take long‐term medications.
We assessed twelve studies involving 2196 participants who were taking self‐administered medications for at least one month.
The studies involved different types of packaging, and different medications for various health problems.
We found that reminder packaging increased the proportion of people taking their medications when measured by pill count; however, this effect was not large.
We also found some evidence that reminder packaging may be beneficial in improving clinical outcomes such as blood pressure.
Reminder packing for certain individuals may represent a simple method for improving the adherence to medications; further research is needed to improve the design and targeting of these devices.
