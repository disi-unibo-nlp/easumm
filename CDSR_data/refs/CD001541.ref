Treatments for ingrowing toenails Ingrowing toenails are a common problem and occur when the edge of the nail grows into flesh at the side of the nail, causing a painful injury.
This punctured skin can become inflamed and infected.
This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'.
We have broadened the scope of this review to include all types of treatment for ingrowing toenails.
As well as including non‐surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails, we have also looked at surgical interventions with pre‐ and postoperative interventions to reduce postoperative complications.
We included 24 randomised controlled trials, with a total of 2826 participants, and our aim was to determine which is the most effective treatment.
By comparison with non‐surgical interventions, surgical interventions are more effective in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail.
We found that none of postoperative treatments used, such as antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone‐iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, reduced the risk of postoperative infection or postoperative pain, or gave a shorter healing time.
Different non‐surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no agreement about a standard first‐choice treatment.
