Thumb‐in‐palm surgery appears to lead to modest improvement in hand function and quality of life in people with cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder caused by damage to the brain around birth.
It causes muscle spasms and contractions that can lead to a condition called thumb‐in‐ palm deformity, severely limiting hand function.
Thumb‐in‐palm surgery is sometimes tried to improve ability to use the thumb.
This review found no randomized controlled trials of thumb‐in‐palm surgery, but some other types of studies.
Although some people with CP who had thumb‐in‐palm surgery experienced some improvement in movement, the improvement was generally modest.
Trials are needed to show if thumb‐in‐palm surgery can improve function and quality of life for people with CP.
