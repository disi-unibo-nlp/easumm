Self management programmes for people living with the long‐term effects of stroke Review question What are the effects of self management programmes for people who have had a stroke?
Background A stroke is caused by an interruption in the blood supply to parts of the brain resulting in damage that affects people's lives and changes their ability to live independently and with quality.
It has been proposed that special training, called 'a self management programme', teaches people about stroke, helps them develop the skills to work with their problems and challenges, and helps them identify and achieve their own goals and help themselves.
Study characteristics We found 14 studies up to April 2016 involving 1863 participants that looked at the benefits of these programmes for people with stroke.
They were conducted in a variety of countries in a variety of formats ‐ sometimes in groups, sometimes individually, and for varying time periods.
Key results We found that such programmes may improve the quality of life after stroke.
People with stroke reported improvements in their ability to live the way they wanted and that they felt more empowered to take charge of their lives, rather than be dependent on other people for their happiness and satisfaction with life.
There were no reports of any risks or negative effects.
Quality of the evidence The majority of the studies were well conducted and represent credible evidence that self management programmes may benefit people with stroke who are living in the community.
