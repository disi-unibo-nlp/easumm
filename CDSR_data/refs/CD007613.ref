Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for people with chronic heart failure and anaemia Chronic heart failure is a disorder in which the heart is unable to pump blood and deliver oxygen adequately throughout the body.
Patients with heart failure may also suffer from anaemia, a condition of reduced red blood cells and diminished ability of the blood to carry oxygen.
These patients appear to have worse symptoms and poorer survival and may benefit from additional therapy for their anaemia.
Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESAs) with iron supplements have been used since the 1980s to treat anaemia in chronic kidney disease and cancer patients.
ESAs have the same action as erythropoietin, a hormone that is naturally produced by the kidneys to increase red blood cell production.
This review shows that ESAs improves anaemia, exercise tolerance, quality of life and reduces symptoms in heart failure patients with a mild anaemia.
ESAs may also reduce hospital admission and improve survival.
There was no increase in major side effects in those receiving ESA therapy compared to control over the 2‐12 month study period (maximum 12 months) although the effects of treatment over a longer period are not known.
More research is needed to clarify the full effects and safety of ESAs as a treatment for anaemia in these patients.
