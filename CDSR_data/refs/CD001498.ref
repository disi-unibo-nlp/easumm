Insufficient evidence of the efficacy of thiamine for people with Alzheimer's disease Preclinical and laboratory studies show an effect of thiamine on the release and breakdown of acetylcholine.
Some intellectual functions, including attention and memory, are influenced by neurons which release acetylcholine.
Cholinergic function is impaired in Alzheimer's disease.
It has therefore been hypothesized that thiamine may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.
Biochemical abnormalities in thiamine‚Äêdependent enzymes have been found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
The three included randomized controlled trials totaled less than 50 participants and insufficient detail in the results did not allow combination of the data.
Thus the review found no evidence of the efficacy of thiamine for people with Alzheimer's disease.
