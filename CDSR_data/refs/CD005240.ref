Motorcycle rider training for preventing road traffic crashes Riders of motorcycles (a two‐wheeled vehicle that is powered by a motor and has no pedals ‐  Oxford English Dictionary Online ), especially novice riders, have an increased risk of being involved in fatal crashes compared to other road users.
Motorcycle rider training could be an important way of reducing the number of crashes and the severity of injuries.
The authors of this review examined all research studies that report an evaluation of the effectiveness of motorcycle rider courses in reducing the number of traffic offences, motorcycle rider crashes, injuries and deaths.
This review included 23 research studies, including three randomised trials, two non‐randomised trials, 14 cohort studies and four case‐control studies.
The types of rider training that were evaluated varied in content and duration.
The findings suggest that mandatory pre‐licence training may present a barrier to completing a motorcycle licensing process, thus possibly indirectly reducing crash, injury, death and offence rates through a reduction in exposure to riding a motorcycle.
However, on the basis of the existing evidence, it is not clear if (or what type of) training reduces the risk of crashes, injuries, deaths or offences in motorcyclists and the selection of the best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended.
It is likely that some type of rider training is necessary to teach motorcyclists basic motorcycle handling techniques and to ride a motorcycle safely.
It is therefore important that further research work be conducted to rigorously evaluate motorcycle rider training courses, particularly in low income countries where the main burden of motorcycle injuries and deaths occur.
