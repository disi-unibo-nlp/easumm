Techniques of intrauterine fetal transfusion for women with red‐cell isoimmunisation for improving health outcomes Red‐cell alloimmunisation can occur when there are incompatibilities between a woman's blood type and that of her unborn baby (such as Rhesus or Kell).
During pregnancy, the baby's blood can cross the placenta and enter the woman's circulation, which may cause her immune system to produce antibodies, that can then destroy the baby's red blood cells (haemolysis).
This can cause the baby to become anaemic (have a low red blood cell count), and if severe, it may require a blood transfusion while the baby still remains within the uterus (called an intrauterine blood transfusion).
This review of two randomised controlled trials, involving 44 pregnant women, found that there is currently insufficient information about the optimal technique for performing fetal intrauterine fetal blood transfusions.
One of the studies compared two different muscle relaxants to keep the baby still during the procedure, and the other gave intrauterine fetal blood transfusions with and with intravenous immunoglobulin, without any clear differences.
