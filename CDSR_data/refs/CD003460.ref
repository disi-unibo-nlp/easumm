Bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome This review evaluates the effectiveness of medical therapies for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
We considered studies involving bulking agents (a fibre supplement), antispasmodics (smooth muscle relaxants) or antidepressants (drugs used to treat depression that can also change pain perceptions) that used outcome measures including improvement of abdominal pain, global assessment (overall relief of IBS symptoms) or symptom score.
We found that bulking agents are not effective for treating IBS.
There is evidence that antispasmodics including cimetropium/dicyclomine peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine are effective for the treatment of IBS.
Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of IBS.
The side effects of these medications were not evaluated in this review.
Physicians should be aware of the limitations of drug therapies and discuss these limitations with their patients before prescribing medication for IBS.
