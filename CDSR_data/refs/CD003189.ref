Granulopoiesis‐stimulating factors in the prevention of adverse effects during the therapeutic treatment of malignant lymphoma.
Lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymph nodes.
It can be treated with chemotherapy (anti‐cancer drugs), but this disrupts the immune system and lowers white cell counts.
This can increase a person's risk of infection and limit the amount of chemotherapy that can be given.
Granulopoiesis‐stimulating factors (GSF) can increase the body's production of white cells.
The review found that treatment with GSF increases white cell counts and reduces the risk of infection in people receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma.
However, GSF treatment did not improve survival.
More research is needed to improve GSF treatments.
