High‐carbohydrate, high‐protein, low‐fat tube feeds versus low‐carbohydrate, high‐protein, high‐fat tube feeds for patients with severe burns Patients with severe burn injuries have increased metabolic needs.
For this and other reasons, they are often fed a formula through a tube inserted directly into the stomach or small intestine, a process known as enteral feeding.
Aggressive enteral feeding of burn patients with a high‐protein diet is a core component of the treatment of severe burn injuries.
However, the optimal proportions of fats and carbohydrates in feeding formulas are unknown.
This review of 93 burn patients in two randomized controlled trials found that high‐carbohydrate, high‐protein, low‐fat enteral feeds reduced incidence of pneumonia compared with low‐carbohydrate, high‐protein, high‐fat enteral feeds in patients hospitalized with severe burn injuries.
No conclusions could be made about the effect of different enteral feeding regimens on death.
The strength of this review's findings were limited by the number, size, and quality of eligible trials.
Further research is needed before strong scientific conclusions and sound clinical recommendations can be made.
