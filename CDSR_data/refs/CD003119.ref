Insufficient evidence of benefits of vinpocetine for people with dementia Preclinical data of uneven quality suggest a potential beneficial effect of vinpocetine in chronic cerebrovascular diseases and on cognitive performance in a variety of animal models.
Clinical trials to test these hypotheses were performed before currently used criteria for dementia had become generally accepted.
The results show improvement after the treatment with vinpocetine versus placebo, but the number of demented patients treated for at least six months was small.
The available data does not demonstrate many side effect problems.
Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use.
