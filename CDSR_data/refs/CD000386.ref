Chloroquine or amodiaquine combined with sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine for treating uncomplicated malaria Using amodiaquine and sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine together to treat uncomplicated malaria instead of sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine alone may reduce treatment failure; adding chloroquine to sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine may not be beneficial Chloroquine, amodiaquine, and sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine are relatively inexpensive drugs to treat malaria.
Treatment failure is a problem when these drugs are used alone because malaria parasites have become resistant to them.
Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, a combination of amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine may reduce treatment failure in some locations.
It appears less likely that chloroquine plus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine will have a treatment benefit over sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine alone.
