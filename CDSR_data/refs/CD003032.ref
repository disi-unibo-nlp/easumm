Ethosuximide, sodium valproate or lamotrigine for absence seizures in children and adolescents Background Epilepsy is a disorder where seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain.
Absence epilepsy involves seizures that cause a sudden loss of awareness.
It often starts in childhood or adolescence.
Three antiepileptic drugs are often used for absence epilepsy: valproate, ethosuximide and lamotrigine.
This review aims to determine which of these three antiepileptic drugs is the best choice for the treatment of absence seizures in children and adolescents.
Results The review found some evidence (based on eight small trials) that individuals taking lamotrigine are more likely to be seizure free than those using placebos.
The review found robust evidence that patients taking ethosuximide or valproate are more likely to be seizure free than those using lamotrigine.
However, because of the lower risk of adverse effects, the use of ethosuximide is preferred over valproate in patients with absence childhood epilepsy.
With regards to both efficacy and tolerability, ethosuximide represents the optimal initial empirical monotherapy for children and adolescents with absence seizures.
The evidence is current to September 2020.
