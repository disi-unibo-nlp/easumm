Types of urethral catheters for management of short‐term voiding problems in hospitalised adults Background on the condition Urethral catheters are small tubes passed into the bladder via the urethra (outlet for urine).
They are often used for a short time after major surgery.
Urethral catheters are also used if a person is unable to empty the bladder when they need to (urinary retention).
They are also used for monitoring urine output in hospitalised patients.
About half of all hospitalised adults who have urethral catheters for longer than a week will get a urinary tract infection (UTI).
The main findings of the review Twenty‐six trials were included in this systematic review involving 12,422 hospitalised adults in 25 parallel group trials, and 27,878 adults in one large cluster‐randomised cross‐over trial.The review of evidence from trials found that although antiseptic‐coated (silver alloy) catheters reduced the number of bacteria in the urine, they did not reduce the number of UTIs caused by the presence of the catheter.
Catheters coated with antimicrobials (antibiotics, nitrofurazone) designed to kill or stop the growth of bacteria may reduce both the number of bacteria in the urine as well as number of people having UTI caused by the presence of the catheter.
However, the evidence is relatively weak, and any benefit is likely to be small and hence unlikely to be meaningful to either patients or clinicians.
Adverse effects These antibiotic catheters are also more likely to cause discomfort for patients compared with standard catheters, and they are more expensive.
Conclusions The best approaches to reducing the risk of UTI include reducing the numbers of unnecessary catheterisations, or reducing the time period during which the catheter is used by removing it as early as possible.
