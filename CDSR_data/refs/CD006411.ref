Educational games to improve health care professional practice and care for patients There have been many ways developed to improve how health care professionals care for their patients.
One way is to use games to improve their knowledge and skills, and change their attitudes and performance.
This review found two eligible studies.
The first study evaluated a game based on the TV show Family Feud and taught about infection control.
The second study evaluated the use of a "Snakes and Ladders" board game in continuing medical education on stroke prevention and management.
The two studies did not consistently show a beneficial effect on knowledge.
We are therefore very uncertain whether games improve health care professional practice or patient care.
