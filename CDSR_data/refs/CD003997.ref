Steroids for improving recovery following tonsillectomy in children After children have a tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (surgery to remove the adenoids and/or tonsils), pain, nausea, vomiting and delays to return to eating are common.
The corticosteroid drug dexamethasone is sometimes given in a single intravenous dose (through the veins) during surgery to try to prevent vomiting after the operation.
We included 19 randomized controlled trials in the review, with a total of 1756 patients.
The review of trials found that a dose of corticosteroid during tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy can prevent vomiting for one out of every five children who gets the drug.
Children also return to a normal diet more quickly and they have less pain after surgery.
