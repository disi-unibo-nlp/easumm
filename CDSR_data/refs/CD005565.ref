Corticosteroid regimens for treatment of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) after allogenic stem cell transplantation Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute and chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD) but their effect on length and quality of life of patients has not been studied systematically.
In this systematic review, we tried to compare the effect of treatment regimens used for GvHD in the absence and presence of corticosteroids, or with different doses of corticosteroids.
After searching relevant sources, we located only two studies that met our criteria to be included in the study.
Their results are described in detail in the text of the review.
In brief, these studies are in favor earlier remission and slightly better outcome in patients but more evidence is needed in this field.
