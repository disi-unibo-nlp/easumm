Antifibrinolytic amino acids for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver disease Review question â€¨ We reviewed antifibrinolytic amino acids for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver disease.
Background Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (vomiting of blood) is one of the most frequent causes of illness and death in the course of liver disease.
People with liver disease frequently have haemostatic abnormalities, which include hyperfibrinolysis (increased prevention of blood clotting).
Antifibrinolytic amino acids have been suggested for the treatment of gastrointestinal emergency, but it is unknown whether they are of benefit or cause harm when used for treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver disease.
Study characteristics We found no randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in this updated review on the benefits and harms of antifibrinolytic amino acids for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with liver diseases.
The evidence is current to February 2015.
Key results Accordingly, we cannot recommend or refute antifibrinolytic amino acids for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people with acute or chronic liver disease.
Quality of evidence We found no randomised clinical trials.
