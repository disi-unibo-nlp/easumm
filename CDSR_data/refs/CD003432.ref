This systematic review focuses on long‐term outcome of laparoscopic versus open surgery for colorectal cancer, including long‐term complications and cancer outcome.
Laparoscopic resection of carcinoma of the colon is associated with a long term outcome no different from that of open colectomy.
In the case of rectal cancer, data on long term outcome are scarce and the results of large randomised trails have to be awaited.
Laparoscopic approach offers short‐term benefits to patients, such as less pain and quicker recovery.
However, concern about port‐site metastases (laparoscopic incision wound) and irradical laparoscopic resections withheld many surgeons from performing laparoscopic surgery for cancer.
Minimally invasive surgery for colon and rectal cancer has mainly been performed within the framework of randomized clinical trials.
