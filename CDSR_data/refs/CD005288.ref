Chinese herbal medicine may help reduce menstrual pain.
Dysmenorrhoea is a very common complaint that refers to painful menstrual cramps in abdomen.
Primary dysmenorrhoea refers to pain of an unknown cause (i.e.
no medical condition is identified).
Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs or the contraceptive pill have been used successfully for treatment but more women are looking for non‐drug therapies.
Chinese herbal medicine has been used for centuries in China and it is currently used in public hospitals in China for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.
The review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in reducing menstrual pain in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea, compared to conventional medicine such as NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill, acupuncture and heat compression.
No significant adverse effects were identified in this review.
However the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies.
