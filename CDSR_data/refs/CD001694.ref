Aerosolized diuretics for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung disease There is no evidence of benefit from routine use of inhaled diuretics in preterm babies at risk of chronic lung disease.
Lung disease in babies born early (preterm) is often complicated with excess accumulation of water in the lungs.
Medications that reduce body water (diuretics) might help the baby recover from lung disease.
In theory, giving the diuretic as an inhaled mist (aerosol) could drain water from the lung more than from the rest of the body, which could reduce adverse effects.
The review found several small trials of a single type of diuretic (furosemide).
A single dose improved lung function, but only temporarily.
No information was available about long term outcome.
