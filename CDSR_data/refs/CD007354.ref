Benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in advanced diseases in adults Background Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in advanced cancer and other diseases at the end of life.
Treating breathlessness sufficiently remains very difficult.
Benzodiazepines are a group of sedating medicines (drugs), including lorazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam, that are used mainly for sleep disturbance and anxiety, but are widely used for the relief of breathlessness.
Key results In this updated systematic review we aimed to determine whether benzodiazepines relieved breathlessness in adults with advanced disease.
In August 2016, we found eight studies.
Benzodiazepines caused more side effects such as drowsiness or somnolence when compared to placebo but caused less side effects when compared to morphine.
Our review therefore supports the use of benzodiazepines only if other first‐line treatments, such as opioids and non‐drug treatments, have failed.
However, there is still an urgent need for more studies in this field to find better ways to relieve this burdensome symptom in people with advanced diseases.
We concluded in summary that there is no evidence that benzodiazepines relieve breathlessness in adults with advanced disease.
