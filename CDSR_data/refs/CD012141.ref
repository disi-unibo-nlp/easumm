Early planned removal versus expectant management of peripherally inserted central catheters to prevent infection in newborn infants Review question   In newborn infants with a peripherally inserted central catheter in place, does early removal of the catheter reduce the risk of complications, including infection?
Background   Infection in the bloodstream is a frequent and harmful complication for newborn infants who have a peripherally inserted central catheter (a long, narrow, soft and flexible plastic tube inserted through the skin into a vein and advanced several centimetres into the infant's large blood vessels; used as a stable route to deliver drugs and nutrition).
Bloodstream infection may cause death and disability.
One potential method of reducing the risk of this and other serious complications is to remove the catheter within about two weeks after insertion rather than leaving it for longer until no longer required.
Study characteristics/key results   We did not find any randomised controlled trials that assessed whether removing peripherally inserted central catheters within two weeks prevents infection or other complications in newborn infants.
Conclusions   There are no trial data available to help clinicians to address this common clinical dilemma.
Due to the potential for benefit and harm, such a trial may be warranted.
