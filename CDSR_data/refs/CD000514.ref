Clot‐dissolving drugs (different doses, routes of administration and agents) for breaking down a blood clot blocking a blood vessel in the brain Many strokes are due to a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain.
Treatments to dissolve the clot (also called thrombolytic treatment) can improve the chance of making a good recovery from a stroke.
This review aimed to find out if there were important differences between different clot‐dissolving drugs.
It also aimed to find out if there were differences in effect when giving the same drug in different doses or by different routes (into an artery or a vein).
The review, which included 20 studies involving 2527 participants, showed that there was some evidence that lower doses of thrombolytic agents led to serious bleeding in the brain less often.
However, it was not clear if the benefit from lower doses was as big as with higher doses.
There was no evidence to show that one thrombolytic agent was clearly better than another, or that intra‐arterial treatment was better than intravenous treatment.
Therefore, more larger randomised controlled trials are required to answer questions about which drug, or dose or route of administration is best for thrombolysis.
At present, rt‐PA as currently licensed in many countries, should be regarded as best practice.
