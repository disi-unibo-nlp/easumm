Single dose oral nefopam for postoperative pain in adults Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures.
Acute postoperative pain of moderate or severe intensity is often used (as a model) to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers.
In this case we could find no studies that tested oral nefopam against placebo.
It is possible that the studies were performed, but not reported, because they were used only to register nefopam with licensing authorities throughout the world.
However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident, at present, about using oral nefopam for acute painful conditions.
