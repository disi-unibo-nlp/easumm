Should the primary cancer be surgically removed in asymptomatic patients with unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer?
A majority of patients with advanced colorectal cancer cannot be cured of their disease.
This is because it has spread widely throughout the body and is therefore not resectable.
In many of these patients, the original cancer that caused the problem is relatively asymptomatic and the patient is not aware of it.
Most of these patients will be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy.
From a clinical perspective, a major problem in dealing with these patients is what to do with the primary cancer.
Some studies have suggested that resecting the primary cancer can prolong survival and prevent complication arising from the cancer, such as obstruction or bleeding.
This review addresses the question of whether surgically removing the primary cancer is beneficial to patients with advanced and unresectable colorectal cancer.
No randomised controlled trials were identified.
