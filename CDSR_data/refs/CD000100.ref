Hepatitis B vaccine prevents hepatitis B infection in health‐care workers Plasma‐derived vaccine significantly prevents hepatitis B events in health‐care workers.
Recombinant vaccine does not significantly differ from plasma‐derived vaccine in eliciting protective hepatitis B surface antibody levels.
Both vaccines are well tolerated.
The intramuscular route causes significantly more systemic adverse events, and the intradermal route causes significantly more local adverse events.
The deltoid injection seems more effective than the gluteal injection in eliciting antibodies.
The standard vaccination schedule (0, 1, and 6 months) elicits a better antibody response than a rapid vaccination schedule (0, 1, and 2 months).
It is unknown whether hepatitis B vaccine protects health‐care workers from infection of mutated hepatitis B virus.
