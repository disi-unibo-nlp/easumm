Oestrogens for urinary incontinence in women Urinary incontinence is the leakage of urine when coughing or exercising (stress urinary incontinence) or after a strong uncontrollable urge to urinate (urgency urinary incontinence).
In women who have gone through the menopause, low oestrogen levels may contribute to urinary incontinence.
The review found 34 trials including more than 19,000 women of whom over 9000 received oestrogen.
The review found that significantly more women who received local (vaginal) oestrogen for incontinence reported that their symptoms improved compared to placebo.
There was no evidence about whether the benefits of local oestrogen continue after stopping treatment but this seems unlikely as women would revert to having naturally low oestrogen levels.
Trials investigating systemic (oral) administration, on the other hand, found that women reported worsening of their urinary symptoms.
The evidence comes mainly from two very large trials including 17,642 incontinent women.
These trials were investigating other effects of hormone replacement therapy as well as incontinence, such as prevention of heart attacks in women with coronary heart disease, bone fractures, breast and colorectal cancer.
In addition, in one large trial women who did not have incontinence at first were more likely to develop incontinence.
There may be risks from long‚Äêterm use of systemic oestrogen, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer of the breast and uterus.
