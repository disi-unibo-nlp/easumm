Tailoring asthma interventions based on exhaled nitric oxide In this review involving 1010 adults and children with asthma, we found that tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide (compared to clinical symptoms with or without spirometry/peak flow) was beneficial in reducing the final (but not the overall) daily inhaled corticosteroid doses in adults.
However in children inhaled corticosteroid dose was increased when exhaled nitric oxide guided strategy was used.
There was no difference between groups in other asthma outcomes (exacerbations, spirometry, FeNO or symptom control).
Thus tailoring the dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on exhaled nitric oxide cannot be routinely advocated.
