Timing of surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage There is no evidence on the best time for surgical treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is a life‚Äêthreatening condition.
It is due to the bursting of an aneurysm (a weakness in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain).
This can be treated by a surgical operation to place a clip over the aneurysm neck.
There is uncertainty about whether to perform the operation immediately, or to wait a few days.
The review found only one randomised trial which assessed the effect of the timing of surgery.
From the limited evidence available, the timing of surgery was not a critical factor in determining the outcome from an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, but further research is needed.
