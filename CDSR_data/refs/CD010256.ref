Intravenous beta 2 ‐agonists and intravenous aminophylline for acute asthma Beta 2 ‐agonist and aminophylline drugs are used for the treatment of asthma and work by opening the airways to help people breathe more easily.
Both drugs can be given intravenously (IV) (directly through a vein).
The question this review considered was whether there was any important difference between these drugs for patients with acute asthma.
This review examined all the randomised controlled trials comparing IV beta 2 ‐agonists to aminophylline.
We found 11 studies involving 350 patients (157 children and 193 adults) with acute asthma.
No consistent evidence favouring either IV beta 2 ‐agonists or IV aminophylline was found from randomised trials of patients with acute asthma.
It is recommended that these results should be viewed carefully alongside the conclusions from separate Cochrane reviews comparing IV beta 2 ‐agonists plus inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists versus inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists alone and IV aminophylline plus inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists versus inhaled beta 2 ‐agonists alone.
