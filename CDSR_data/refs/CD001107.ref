Inhaled steroids for episodic viral wheeze of childhood A wheeze that is recurrent and caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is different to asthma.
Episodic recurrent wheezing happens in children who have no symptoms in between episodes and is different to wheezing that is persistent.
Corticosteroids are used to relieve a wheeze caused by a viral infection.
This review of trials found high dose inhaled corticosteroids help treat mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood.
There is no evidence to support the use of maintenance low dose inhaled corticosteroids to prevent or manage episodic mild wheeze caused by a virus.
More research is needed.
