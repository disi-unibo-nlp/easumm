Length of treatment with vitamin K antagonists and prevention of recurrence in patients with venous thromboembolism Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when a blood clot is formed in a deep vein, or when it detaches itself and lodges in the lung vessels.
These clots can be fatal if blood flow to the heart is blocked.
Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are given to people who have experienced a VTE, to prevent recurrence.
The major complication of this treatment is bleeding.
The continuing risk of bleeding with drug use and uncertainty regarding the extent of the risk of recurrence make it important to look at the proper duration of treatment with VKA for these patients.
The review authors searched the literature and were able to combine data from 11 randomized controlled clinical trials (3716 participants) comparing different durations of treatment with VKA in patients with a symptomatic VTE.
Participants receiving prolonged treatment had around five times lower risk of recurrence of VTE.
On the other hand, they had about three times higher risk of bleeding complications.
Prolonged treatment did not reduce the risk of death.
Prolonged use of VKA strongly reduced the risk of recurrent clots as long as they were used, but benefit decreased over time and the risk of major bleeding remained.
