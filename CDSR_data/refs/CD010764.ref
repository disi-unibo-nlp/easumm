Controlling blood glucose in treating diabetic foot ulcers (sores) Background:  People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers (sores) for a number of reasons.
This includes nerve damage and reduced blood flow to the feet and legs.
Having high blood glucose may affect the ability of foot ulcers to heal and therefore intensively controlling blood glucose may be beneficial.
Review question:  This Cochrane review aimed to answer the question; how does controlling blood glucose more intensively compared to conventional blood glucose control influence foot ulcer healing in people with diabetes?
What we found:  We did not find any trials which have been completed on this topic with available results.
The only trial which met our criteria for inclusion had been terminated due to encountering difficulties with recruiting participants.
Therefore we cannot be sure whether controlling blood glucose intensively when people have diabetic foot ulcers is beneficial or harmful.
The lack of evidence however should not deter efforts to achieve optimal glycaemic control in people with diabetic foot ulcers to encourage healing as is current practice.
We believe there are currently two trials underway which may provide some evidence on this topic once completed.
