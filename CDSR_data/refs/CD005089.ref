Partial exchange transfusion to prevent neurodevelopmental disability in infants with polycythemia Polycythemia is a condition in which there are too many red blood cells in the blood circulation.
Polycythemia may occur with many different conditions.
Some of the babies affected by polycythemia include those born after 42 weeks (post‐term), small for gestational age (SGA )/intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR ), identical twins who share the same placenta and develop twin to twin transfusion, infants of diabetic mothers, and those with chromosomal abnormalities.
Mild polycythemia may not cause problems.
However, too many red blood cells can make the blood "viscous', making it harder to circulate through the vessels and to the organs and cause complications.
The accepted treatment of polycythemia is partial exchange transfusion (PET).
PET involves slowly removing some of the blood volume and replacing the withdrawn blood with fluids to help dilute the red blood cell concentration.Treatment of polycythemia with PET is controversial.
It may be associated with earlier improvement of symptoms.This review of trials found that there is no evidence of long‐term benefit from PET in polycythemic infants, but the estimates of these effects are extremely imprecise due to the large number of surviving infants who were not assessed.
