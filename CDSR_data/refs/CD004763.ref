Laser photocoagulation for treating neovascular age‐related macular degeneration Laser photocoagulation was the first treatment introduced to try to halt the progression of neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), in which newly formed vessels or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) grow under the macula leading to the occurrence of a scotoma or blind spot in the central visual field.
One disadvantage is that it causes a dark spot in the visual field.
This is of concern when the lesion is in the centre of the macula.
Fifteen trials involving a total of 2064 participants were included.
Three types of photocoagulation were used in the trials: direct photocoagulation of the entire CNV, perifoveal photocoagulation and grid photocoagulation.
Control groups in the trials included observation only, submacular surgery and different lasers.
This review found that the use of photocoagulation is effective for people with lesions that are outside the centre of the macula.
However, these types of lesions are less common in AMD.
Severe loss of vision can be prevented in about one in six people.
