A comparison of a local anaesthetic injection below the collarbone with other injection techniques for providing anaesthesia of the lower arm Surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm, from the elbow to the hand, may be provided by injecting local anaesthetic around the brachial plexus (the bundle of nerves passing from the spinal cord in the neck to the arm, through the shoulder).
There are several commonly‐used techniques of blocking the brachial plexus but it is not clear which, if any, is the best.
This updated systematic review compared the effects of blocking the brachial plexus by injecting local anaesthetic in the area below the collarbone (the infraclavicular block) with other techniques.
We searched the databases until June 2013, and included 22 studies involving 1732 patients of whom 842 had an infraclavicular block and 930 had brachial plexus blockade with another technique.
These other techniques were axillary block (injection in the armpit area; 14 studies), supraclavicular block (injection in the area just above the collarbone; six studies), mid‐humeral block (injection in the upper arm; two studies) and parascalene block (injection in the lower neck area; one study).
One study compared an infraclavicular block with both an axillary block and a supraclavicular block.
The infraclavicular block had a high success rate and was as good as all other blocks in providing anaesthesia of the lower arm.
Advantages of the infraclavicular block included a reduced risk of pain from the tourniquet applied to the upper arm during surgery and a faster performance time (four minutes on average) compared to more complex techniques of axillary or mid‐humeral block that used three or four separate injections (instead of just one).
Side‐effects were uncommon, and no difference was seen between the infraclavicular block and all other blocks in this regard.
In conclusion, this review showed that the infraclavicular block is an effective and safe choice for producing anaesthesia of the lower arm.
