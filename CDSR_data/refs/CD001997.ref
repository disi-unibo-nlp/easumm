Elective delivery in diabetic pregnant women Induction of labour at 38 weeks pregnancy for women with diabetes treated with insulin lowers the chances of delivering a large baby.
Women with diabetes or gestational diabetes are more likely to have a large baby, which can cause problems around birth.
Early elective delivery (labour induction or caesarean section) aims to avoid these complications.
However, early elective delivery can also cause problems.
The review found only one trial of labour induction for women with diabetes treated with insulin.
Induction of labour lowered the number of large babies without increasing the risk of caesarean section.
However, there was not enough evidence to definitively assess this intervention.
