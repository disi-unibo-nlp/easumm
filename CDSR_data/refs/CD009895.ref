Which studies were included in the review?
Databases were searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of DMT for depression up to October 2014, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity.
Three studies (147 participants) met inclusion criteria: two of adults (men and women); and one of adolescents (females only).
What does the evidence from the review tell us?
Due to the low number of studies and low quality of evidence, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of DMT for depression.
It was not possible to compare DMT with medication, talking therapies, physical treatments or to compare types of DMT due to lack of available evidence.
Key findings were: Overall, there is no evidence for or against DMT as a treatment for depression.
There is some evidence to suggest DMT is more effective than standard care for adults, but this was not clinically significant.
DMT is no more effective than standard care for young people.
Evidence from just one study of low methodological quality suggested that drop‚Äêout rates from the DMT group were not significant, and there is no reliable effect in either direction for quality of life or self esteem.
A large positive effect was observed for social functioning, but since this was from one study of low methodological quality the result is imprecise.
What should happen next?
Future studies should be of high methodological quality, comparing DMT with other treatments for depression, and include economic analyses.
