Drugs as treatment for self‐injurious behaviour in adults with intellectual disabilities Self‐injurious behaviour (SIB) among people with intellectual disability is relatively common and often persistent.
It is difficult to treat, and presents challenges to those with caring responsibilities and to clinicians.
Several types of drugs have been used by clinicians to help with this problem but none is licensed for self injury.
In this review we aimed to assess if medications used in the management of SIB in adults with intellectual disability are safe and help reduce the behaviours.
We looked for studies that compared antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilisers with no active medication (placebo).
We found only five studies: four examined the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist (which works through modulating pain perception) and one examined the antidepressant clomipramine.
There were only a total of 50 participants included in these studies, which was not enough to determine whether or not the intervention resulted in any improvement.
Three of the naltrexone studies and the one clomipramine study indicated the drugs resulted in clinical improvement in SIB, but more evidence is needed.
The data is too limited for us to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the benefits or safety of any medications for SIB in this population.
We need more studies where many more participants are involved to know whether medications help in reducing SIB and if they are safe.
