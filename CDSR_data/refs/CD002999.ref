Psychosocial interventions to help people with chronic bronchitis and emphysema to quit smoking.
Smoking cessation is the most important treatment for smokers with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking cessation interventions can be divided into psychosocial interventions (e.g.
counselling, self‚Äêhelp materials, and behavioral therapy) and pharmacotherapy (e.g.
nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion).
Although a lot of research has been done on the effectiveness of interventions for "healthy" smokers, the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for smokers with chronic bronchitis and emphysema has so far gained far less attention.
However, there is some evidence that combining psychosocial intervention with pharmacotherapy could be effective for this group of smokers trying to quit smoking.
More research is needed to determine what kinds of interventions are most effective for which kind of patient.
