Higher versus lower protein intake in formula‐fed low birth weight infants Review question Does feeding preterm or low birth weight infants (< 2.5 kilograms) higher protein intake during the initial hospital stay improve growth and developmental outcomes?
Background Infants grow quickly and need more protein for each kilogram of body weight than older children and adults.
Infants born with low birth weight, for example, those who are born prematurely, need more protein because of their fast growth rates.
Study characteristics We identified six eligible trials that enrolled a total of 218 infants through searches updated to August 2, 2019.
Key results Higher protein intake (3 to 4 versus less than 3 grams of protein per kilogram) resulted in slightly greater weight gain, of around 2 grams per kilogram per day.
We are uncertain whether this difference in protein intake affects head and length growth because not many infants were studied.
Existing research does support specific recommendations regarding formula with protein content that provides more than 4 g/kg/d.
No harmful effects were observed.
Certainty of evidence The review was limited in the conclusions made because differences in protein content among comparison groups in some individual trials were small and formulas differed substantially across studies; some studies included healthier and more mature preterm infants.
Information on long‐term outcomes is limited.
