The effectiveness of low‐dose corticosteroids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity over the moderate term Low dose corticosteroid use in RA is currently widespread with up to 80% of patients using prednisone or similar corticosteroid preparations in many arthritis practices, but the value of corticosteroids for the treatment of RA has been debated by several authors.
We included studies that used prednisone (or a comparable corticosteroid preparation) at a mean dose of less than or equal to 15 mg per day.
We included studies that utilized either placebo controls or active controls (i.e.
comparative studies).
Very few studies directly assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroids for RA treatment and many were of poor methodologic quality.
Only seven of 34 studies identified by our search met criteria for inclusion.
Our results indicated that corticosteroids were significantly more effective than placebo controls for four of six outcomes assessed [standardized mean difference for tender joints = ‐0.37 (95%CI: ‐0.59, ‐0.14), swollen joints = ‐0.41 (‐0.67, ‐0.16), pain = ‐0.43 (‐0.74, ‐0.12), and functional status = ‐0.57 (‐0.92, ‐0.22)].
The results for grip strength and ESR were not significant [GS = +0.30 (‐0.19, +0.80), weighted mean difference (WMD) for ESR = ‐7.03 (‐18.06, +4.01)].
The single trial that compared prednisone to aspirin indicated no statistically significant difference between these groups for joint tenderness (0.10 (‐0.35, +0.55) and for ESR [0.00 (‐11.09, +11.09].
Overall, the four outcomes assessed in the single trial that compared prednisone to chloroquine suggested that there was no statistically significant differenece in the effectiveness of these two agents [SMD for joint tenderness = +0.23 (‐0.30, +0.75), swollen joints = +0.43 (‐0.11, +0.96), functional status = ‐0.27 (‐0.80, +0.26), and WMD for ESR = ‐16.00 (‐30.58, ‐1.42)].
