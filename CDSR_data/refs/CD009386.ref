Internet‐based programmes for people with heart disease Review question Are Internet‐based support programmes for people with heart disease helpful in improving their heart disease condition?
Background Heart disease is the most common cause of ill health and preventable death.
Cardiac rehabilitation is a programme that helps people with heart disease gain better health.
It is held in group classes that take place at hospitals or within the community.
People attend these classes once or twice a week for around six to eight weeks.
The classes usually involve exercising, and receiving advice on ways to improve their health.
People needing these programmes are not always able to attend them.
An alternative is to provide this programme through the Internet.
In this review we looked at whether programmes delivered through the Internet are helpful in improving death rates, the need for surgery, repeated heart attacks, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, health‐related quality of life (HRQOL), diet, physical activity, medication compliance, healthcare usage, and costs.
Study characteristics The evidence is current to December 2014.
We included 18 studies.
Eleven are complete, and seven are ongoing.
In the completed studies, 1392 people with coronary heart disease were recruited.
The average age of participants ranged from 54.9 to 66.27 years.
The majority of people recruited were men.
Studies were carried out worldwide, and in a variety of healthcare settings.
Seven studies tested broad programmes targeting multiple lifestyle factors related to heart disease.
Four studies tested programmes focused only on increasing levels of physical activity.
The length of the programmes in the included studies ranged from six weeks to one year.
These programmes were compared to no intervention in six studies, some support in three studies, and full traditional rehabilitation in two studies.
Key results There is no evidence to date to suggest that Internet‐delivered programmes help reduce rates of death or future cardiac surgery, but this was based on a small number of studies.
There is also no strong evidence to date suggesting a benefit of these programmes for lipid levels or blood pressure.
There is some evidence to suggest improvements in HRQOL and behaviour change, but there is insufficient evidence to date to draw firm conclusions.
Studies have not yet measured the impact of Internet‐delivered programmes on medication compliance.
There was very limited information on healthcare utilisation and cost of interventions.
The reporting of the seven ongoing studies will add to the evidence base.
Quality of the evidence The evidence was generally of low quality.
The included studies were at some risk of bias, with six studies judged at high risk of bias for some risk of bias domains.
The results of this review therefore need to be interpreted cautiously.
There is currently limited evidence on the effects of Internet‐based interventions for the treatment of coronary heart disease.
We identified seven ongoing trials, which we will incorporate into this review when the results are available.
