Artemisinin derivatives for treating severe malaria Artemisinin drugs improve survival in severe malaria.
Artemisinin drugs come originally from a plant that has been used since ancient times in China as a traditional medicine for fever and malaria.
They are fast acting and effective against malaria parasites that have developed resistance to quinine.
The review shows that treatment with artemisinin drugs may be better than quinine at preventing death in adults and children with severe and complicated malaria.
There is no evidence so far against early treatment with suppositories in rural areas whilst patients are transferred to hospital.
Few side effects have been reported with these drugs.
