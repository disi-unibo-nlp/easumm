Treating hypertension greatly reduces the risk of serious health problems such as heart disease or stroke in African American women and in older women Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
Several treatments exist, including many drugs, to try to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of serious health problems.
Hypertension is a significant risk for heart disease in women, and certain groups such as African American women or older women (over 55 years) are more likely to suffer from hypertension.
The review found that treating women for hypertension greatly reduced the risk of heart disease and stroke in older women and in African American women of all ages.
Treating hypertension in these women is therefore important.
