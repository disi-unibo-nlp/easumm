Antibiotic prophylaxis for first trimester induced abortion Infection of the upper genital tract, including the uterus and fallopian tubes, can cause complications after induced abortion.
Antibiotics given around the time of the abortion (prophylaxis) could prevent this complication.
We found 19 randomised controlled trials that looked at the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on post‐abortal upper genital tract infection amongst women requesting induced abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.
We looked at the effect of any antibiotic prophylaxis regimen on the outcome.
Overall, the risk of post‐abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving antibiotics was 59% that of women who received placebo.
There were, however, differences between the trial results over and above what would be expected by chance alone.
It should be noted that, if the infection is caused by a sexually transmitted organism, antibiotic prophylaxis will not protect the woman from becoming re‐infected if her sexual partner has not been treated.
None of the trials was done in lower or middle income countries, which is where the risk of post‐abortal complications is highest.
Further trials are needed to determine whether combinations of antibiotics can prevent more infections than single antibiotics, or whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be restricted to women with positive results of screening tests before the abortion.
