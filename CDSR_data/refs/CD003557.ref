Antibiotics and antiseptics to help healing venous leg ulcers Venous leg ulcers are a type of wound that can take a long time to heal.
These ulcers can become infected, and this might cause further delay to healing.
Two types of treatment are available to treat infection: systemic antibiotics (i.e.
antibiotics taken by mouth or by injection) and topical preparations (i.e.
treatments applied directly to the wound).
Whether systemic or topical preparations are used, patients will also usually have a wound dressing and bandage over the wound.
This review was undertaken to find out whether using antibiotics and antiseptics works better than usual care in healing venous leg ulcers, and if so, to find out which antibiotic and antiseptic preparations are better than others.
In terms of topical preparations, some evidence is available to support the use of cadexomer iodine (a topical agent thought to have cleansing and antibacterial effects).
Current evidence does not support the use of honey‐ or silver‐based products.
Further good quality research is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of antibiotic tablets and topical agents such as povidone‐iodine, peroxide‐based products and other topical antibiotics and antiseptics in healing venous leg ulceration.
