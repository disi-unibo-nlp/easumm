Urinary diversion and bladder reconstruction/replacement using intestinal segments for intractable incontinence following bladder surgery The normal urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that lies deep in the pelvis.
It functions through the balanced activity of many inter‚Äêrelated nerves and muscles that contain or empty urine as needed.
If the bladder has been damaged by disease, surgery can be performed to divert the urine from the bladder (urinary diversion), to reconstruct the bladder or to replace the bladder with intestinal segments.
The review did not find enough evidence from trials to show which surgical options are the most effective.
One small trial suggested that the ileum bowel segment (small bowel) may be better compared to ileocolonic bowel segment (combination of small and large bowel) for night time incontinence.
More research is needed to determine the most effective surgical methods for urinary diversion, reconstruction or replacement of the urinary bladder that has been damaged by disease.
