Antivirals for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a condition in which wart‚Äêlike growths occur in the upper airway of children or adults.
This can cause difficulty in breathing or a change in voice.
This condition is usually treated by repeated surgery to remove these 'warts', but it has been proposed that additionally using antiviral medications may help this condition.
This review found one good quality study of cidofovir (an antiviral agent) injected into the warts at the time of surgical removal.
After one year of treatment, however, this study found no benefit of the injected cidofovir when compared to injected salt water solution (placebo).
There is still a need for a larger randomised study which includes more patients, and higher doses of cidofovir.
