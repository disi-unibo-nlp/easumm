Prophylactic oral/topical non‐absorbed antifungal agents to prevent invasive fungal infection in very low birth weight infants Review question: In very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, does prophylactic oral/topical non‐absorbed antifungal therapy reduce the risk of invasive fungal infection, mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes?
Background: Fungi such as candida (the organism that causes thrush) can cause bloddstream and other severe infections in VLBW infants (birth weight less than 1500 grams).
These infections are often difficult to diagnose and frequently cause death or disability.
Therefore, it may be appropriate to attempt to prevent such infections by giving VLBW infants antifungal drugs as a routine part of their care.
This review assessed specifically the effect of giving infants antifungal drugs that reduce skin and gut carriage of fungi to reduce the chances of a severe infection developing.
Study characteristics: Four trials, in which a total of 1800 infants participated, examined whether giving VLBW infants a drug to prevent fungi growing on the skin or in the gut reduced the risk of bloodstream or other severe infection.
The trials used one of two commonly available drugs (nystatin or miconazole) and compared these with either a placebo ("dummy" drug) or no drug.
These trials, however, had some design weaknesses that make it less certain that their results can be taken at face value.
Key results: The overall analysis suggested that this treatment might reduce severe infection rates in VLBW infants but there was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of dying.
Conclusions: Larger and higher quality trials are needed to resolve this uncertainty.
