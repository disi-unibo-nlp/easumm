Domiciliary oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Some people with chronic lung disease (COPD ‚Äê chronic bronchitis or emphysema) have low levels of oxygen in their blood.
Oxygen levels might be low all the time, or only at night when breathing slows during sleep.
Some people use bottled oxygen through the night at home, to try and improve their breathing.
The review of trials found that when people with COPD and low levels of blood oxygen did this for the long term, their survival rates improved.
However, it did not lengthen survival of people whose oxygen levels were only moderately low, or only low at night.
