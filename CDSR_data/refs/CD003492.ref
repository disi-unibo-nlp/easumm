Lithium versus antidepressants in the long‐term treatment of unipolar affective disorder This systematic review investigated the efficacy and tolerability of lithium compared to antidepressants for the long‐term treatment of unipolar affective disorder.
Eight randomised studies (reporting on 475 participants) were included in the review.
We found no reliable evidence of any robust differences between lithium and antidepressants but nor could we reliably exclude the possibility of clinically significant differences.
In this review some studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder.
The review suggests that, while lithium may be of benefit in preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder, there remains uncertainty about the treatment effect in comparison with antidepressants.
Interpretation of this review should consider that the number of participants in the studies was small and the included studies had methodological shortcomings.
