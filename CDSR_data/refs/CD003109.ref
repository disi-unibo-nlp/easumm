Advanced training in trauma life support for ambulance crews Injury is one of the top ten causes of death and disability worldwide.
It results in an early loss of life for many young people and ongoing high medical care costs among survivors.
Advanced life support (ALS) training for ambulance crews with emphasis on trauma is believed to have contributed to a reduction in the number of deaths from injury in predominantly high‐income countries where this service is available.
ALS services are also being adapted for low‐ and middle‐income countries.
This review of trials found there is no evidence to suggest that ALS training for ambulance personnel improves the outcomes for injured people.
