Detecting recurrent colorectal cancer by testing for blood carcino‐embryonic antigen (CEA).
Background After surgery for cancer in the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer), most people are intensively followed up for at least five years to monitor for signs of the cancer returning.
When this occurs, it usually causes a rise in a blood protein called CEA (carcino‐embryonic antigen).
An increased level of CEA can be picked up by a blood test, which is normally done every three to six months after colorectal cancer surgery.
Those people with raised CEA levels are further investigated by x‐ray imaging (usually a scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis).
We conducted this review to help decide what level of blood CEA should lead to further investigation.
Key Results This review shows that setting a low cut‐off point will increase the number of genuine cases of colorectal cancer recurrence that are detected (true positives), but a low cut‐off will also cause unnecessary alarm by incorrectly classifying too many cases that are not actually recurrences (false positives).
In addition, this review shows that a rise in CEA does not occur in up to 20% of patients with a true recurrence (false negatives).
The current evidence supports using the highest cut‐off point assessed (10 µg/L), but that adding another diagnostic modality (e.g.
a single scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at 12 to 18 months) is necessary in order to avoid the missed cases.
