Surgical interventions for pharyngeal pouch A pharyngeal pouch is a pocket which can develop in the pharynx (throat), just above the entrance to the oesophagus (gullet).
It may cause difficulty in swallowing, sensation of a lump in the throat and troublesome regurgitation of food.
Food may become lodged in the pouch and this, as well as regurgitation, may lead to weight loss, hoarseness of voice and recurrent chest infections.
A pharyngeal pouch is treated by surgery which may either be 'open' (through an incision in the neck) or 'endoscopic' (through the mouth).
The review found no evidence to show which surgical method is more effective.
