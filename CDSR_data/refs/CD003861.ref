The effects of water compared with other solutions for wound cleansing Water is frequently used for cleaning wounds to prevent infection.
This can be tap water, distilled water, cooled boiled water or saline (salty water).
Using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults does not increase the infection rate; however, there is no strong evidence that cleansing per se is better than not cleansing.
The reviewers concluded that where tap water is high quality (drinkable), it may be as good as other methods such as sterile water or saline (salty) water (and more cost‚Äêeffective), but more research is needed.
