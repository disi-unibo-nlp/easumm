Calcium channel blockers for pulmonary arterial hypertension Background The blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs is normally much lower than the blood pressure in the rest of the body.
Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pulmonary arterial pressure gradually rises which causes damage to the heart, and can finally lead to heart failure and death.
Calcium channel blockers are drugs which can relax the pulmonary arteries and decrease resistance and pressure of these vessels; this may benefit patients with pulmonary hypertension.
What we did We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing calcium channel blockers with placebo.
What we found We found only one trial.
This trial has not been published in full and instead was presented as an abstract at a conference.
Therefore we had only limited data from this trial to consider.
The trial assessed the use of calcium channel blockers for pulmonary hypertension and did not reveal any improving effect on patient's exercise capacity (a primary outcome of this review) by calcium channel blocker.
We believe more research is needed, specifically RCTs should be done on this topic.
This is because evidence from several non‚Äêrandomized controlled studies suggest possible benefits, but we cannot be certain without RCTs.
