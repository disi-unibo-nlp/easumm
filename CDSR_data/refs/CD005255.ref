Responsive feeding versus scheduled feeding for preterm infants Review question:  Does a policy of feeding preterm infants on a responsive basis compared to feeding prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals improve growth, length of hospital stay and parent satisfaction?
Background:  Feeding preterm infants in response to their hunger and satiation cues (responsive, cue‐based, or infant‐led feeding) rather than at scheduled intervals might enhance infants' and parents' experience and satisfaction, help in the establishment of independent oral feeding, increase nutrient intake and growth rates, and allow earlier hospital discharge.
Study characteristics:  We searched for all available evidence up to January 2016.
We found nine eligible randomised controlled trials (including a total of 593 infants) that examined whether feeding preterm infants in response to their own feeding and satiation cues (sometimes called 'demand' feeding) is better than feeding set volumes of milk at predefined intervals.
These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding.
Results:  Although the trials were generally small and most had some methodological weaknesses, analysis suggests that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain and reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding.
The quality of this evidence is low, and the importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the length of hospitalisation.
None of the included trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views.
Conclusions:  This Cochrane review does not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding improves outcomes for preterm infants or their families.
Responsive feeding might help infants transition more quickly to oral feeding, but more randomised controlled trials would be needed to confirm this finding.
