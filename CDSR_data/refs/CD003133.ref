The addition of anti‐leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids versus placebo for chronic asthma Inhaled steroids remain the cornerstone of asthma treatment.
Anti‐leukotrienes constitute a new class of drugs that can be taken by mouth and do not have the side effects associated with steroids.
We looked to see how effective these drugs were when they were added to the treatment of patients who needed steroid inhalers to control their asthma.In asthmatics that are not well controlled on inhaled steroids, the addition of anti‐leukotrienes brings modest improvement in asthma control but it remains unclear whether they are as effective as increasing the dose of inhaled steroids.
Higher doses of anti‐leukotrienes are more effective, but associated with an increased risk of side effect that occurs with these particular drugs.
In asthmatics that are well controlled on inhaled steroids, the addition of anti‐leukotrienes did not allow a reduction in the amount of inhaled steroid used but they seemed to have a beneficial effect on the asthma control.
There are only two studies that have looked at these issues in children; this is insufficient to firmly conclude whether anti‐leukotrienes are useful in children.
