Benefits of antihypertensive drugs for mild hypertension are unclear Individuals with mildly elevated blood pressures, but no previous cardiovascular events, make up the majority of those considered for and receiving antihypertensive therapy.
The decision to treat this population has important consequences for both the patients (e.g.
adverse drug effects, lifetime of drug therapy, cost of treatment, etc.)
and any third party payer (e.g.
high cost of drugs, physician services, laboratory tests, etc.).
In this review, existing evidence comparing the health outcomes between treated and untreated individuals are summarized.
Available data from the limited number of available trials and participants showed no difference between treated and untreated individuals in heart attack, stroke, and death.
About 9% of patients treated with drugs discontinued treatment due to adverse effects.
Therefore, the benefits and harms of antihypertensive drug therapy in this population need to be investigated by further research.
