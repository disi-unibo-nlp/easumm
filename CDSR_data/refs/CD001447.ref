Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) is a fatal neurological disease which produces paralysis of the limb, swallowing and breathing muscles.
There is no available treatment to stop or reverse its progressive course.
In this review, we examine the evidence from four randomized clinical trials involving 1477 people with ALS.
The methodological quality of the trials was acceptable and three of the trials were easily comparable (although one of them included older patients with more advanced ALS).
The searches for this review were last updated in 2011, when we found no new randomized controlled trials.
The results indicate that riluzole 100 mg probably prolongs median survival in people with ALS by two to three months and the safety of the drug is not a major concern.
The evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that participants taking riluzole probably survive longer than participants taking placebo.
The beneficial effects are very modest and the drug is expensive.
There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength.
Adverse effects from riluzole are relatively minor and for the most part reversible after stopping the drug.
