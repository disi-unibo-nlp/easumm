Drug therapy to treat high levels of uric acid in people with high blood pressure Background This is the second update of this Cochrane Review.
The evidence is current to May 2020.
Uric acid is the natural end product of the breakdown of the body's tissues and a person's food, particularly protein.
Uric acid is usually removed from the blood by the kidneys, and removed from the body in the urine.
If too much uric acid is produced, or the kidneys are not able to remove it from the blood, uric acid levels in the blood increase (termed hyperuricaemia).
A link between hyperuricaemia and high blood pressure (hypertension) has been recognized since the 19th century.
This review aims to evaluate whether lowering uric acid levels in the blood could also lower blood pressure.
Study characteristics In this update, we examined 722 records, and selected 26 for further evaluation.
We did not find any additional studies to add to the three studies (211 participants) that were already included in the review.
These studies evaluated adolescents and adults.
They compared drug therapy, given to decrease uric acid, with a placebo control, in people diagnosed with hypertension.
What the research says We found inconclusive results as to whether drug therapy to lower uric acid reduced blood pressure more than placebo, in people who had high blood pressure and high blood levels of uric acid.
Drug therapy decreased blood levels of uric acid better than placebo.
The results for side effects were inconclusive between the drug therapy and placebo groups.
There is not enough evidence to show that drugs that lower blood levels of uric acid also reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension.
More research on this question is needed.
Certainty of the evidence Low‐certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy to treat high blood levels of uric acid reduces blood pressure.
We reduced the certainty of the evidence because the studies presented limited data and inconsistent results for this outcome.
High‐certainty evidence found that uric acid‐lowering drug therapy decreases uric acid.
Low‐certainty evidence failed to establish whether drug therapy increased the occurrence of side effects.
We reduced the certainty of the evidence because of issues with study design, lack of data, and inconsistent results across studies.
We cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.
