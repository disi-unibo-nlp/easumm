Conservative management of symptomatic and/or complicated haemorrhoids in pregnancy and the puerperium Not enough evidence on non‐surgical interventions for treating problematic piles (haemorrhoids) during pregnancy and in the early weeks after birth (puerperium).
Piles (haemorrhoids) are swollen veins in the back passage (anus).
They normally help empty the back passage and prevent involuntary losses.
If swollen in pregnancy, they can cause pain, itching, burning sensation and occasionally bleeding.
These problems usually resolve after the baby is born.
The incidence is low in countries where the diet is mainly fibre‐based.
Non‐surgical treatments during pregnancy include increasing fibre in the diet and drugs to improve circulation or relieve pain.
The review of two trials, involving 150 women, found no studies on dietary modifications, but information on some drugs that looked promising but had insufficient data.
More research is needed.
