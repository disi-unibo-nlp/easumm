Ileostomy or colostomy for temporary decompression of colorectal anastomosis Anastomotic leakage after left‚Äêsided colorectal resections is a serious complication, which leads to increase morbidity and mortality and prolonged the hospital stay.
Proximal fecal diversion may limit the consequences of anastomotic failure.
It remains controversial whether a loop ileostomy or a loop transverse colostomy is a better form of fecal diversion.
This review included five randomised trials (334 patients), comparing loop ileostomy (168 patients) and loop colostomy (166 patients) used to decompression of a colorectal anastomosis.
Except for stoma prolapse, none of the reported outcomes reported were statistically or clinically significant.
Continuous outcomes, such as lenght of hospital stay, was not included due to insufficient data reported in the primary studies.
