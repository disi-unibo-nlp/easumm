Single dose oral aceclofenac for postoperative pain in adults Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures.
Acute postoperative pain of moderate or severe intensity is often used (as a model) to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers.
In this case we could find only a single study testing oral aceclofenac 150 mg against placebo, and aceclofenac was not statistically better than placebo.
It is possible that other studies were done, possibly at larger or more effective doses, but not reported because they were used only to register aceclofenac with licensing authorities throughout the world.
However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral aceclofenac for acute painful conditions.
