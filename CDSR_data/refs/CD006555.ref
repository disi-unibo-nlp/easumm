Exercises for the prevention of recurrences of episodes of low‐back pain Back pain is a common disorder that has a tendency to recur.
We conducted this review to see if exercises, either as part of treatment or as a post‐treatment programme could reduce back pain recurrences.
We searched for studies that included persons with back pain experience, interventions consisting of only exercises and that measured recurrences of back pain.
There were nine studies with 1520 participants.
There was moderate quality evidence that post‐treatment exercises can reduce both the rate and the number of recurrences of back pain.
However, the results of exercise treatment studies were conflicting.
Adverse (side) effects of exercising were not mentioned in any of the studies.
Limitations of this review include the difference in exercises across studies, thus making it difficult to specify the content of such a programme to prevent back pain recurrences.
