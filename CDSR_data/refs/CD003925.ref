Orientation and mobility training for people with low vision Progressive visual impairment often affects people as they age.
Training is used to help people with low vision maintain travel independence, with new orientation and mobility skills to compensate for reduced visual information.
Orientation is the ability to recognise one's position in relation to the environment, whereas mobility is the ability to move around safely and efficiently.
Orientation and mobility (O&M) training teaches people to use their remaining vision and other senses to get around.
Canes and optical aids may also be used.
We found two small studies with a total of 63 people comparing O&M training delivered by a trained volunteer to physical exercise.
These studies did not show a difference between the two interventions, but they had little power to do so because of the small sample size and poor methodological quality.
There were no adverse effects of O&M training in these studies.
There is little evidence from randomised controlled trials on which type of O&M training is better for people with low vision who have specific characteristics and needs.
