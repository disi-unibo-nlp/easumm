Interventions for vaginismus Vaginismus is when the muscles in the vagina tighten and prevent a woman having (vaginal) intercourse.
It can cause distress, relationship problems and also infertility.
Many treatments have been tried including sex therapy, education, hypnosis and drug treatments.
Sex therapy may involve relaxation techniques and gradually inserting a dilator or finger into the vagina (this may be called systematic desensitisation).
This review found five poor to moderate quality studies, of which four with a total of 282 women provided data.
There was not enough evidence to say if systematic desensitisation worked better than another treatment.
Further studies including larger numbers of women are needed to show if systematic desensitisation if effective for the treatment of women with vaginismus.
