Preoperative fasting for adults to prevent perioperative complications General anaesthetic reduces reflexes that stop regurgitated gastric juices reaching the lungs.
As this can be dangerous, people are often advised to have nothing to eat or drink from the midnight before surgery.
However, the review of trials found that drinking clear fluids up to a few hours before surgery did not increase the risk of regurgitation during or after surgery.
Some people are considered more likely to regurgitate under anaesthetic, including those who are pregnant, elderly, obese or have stomach disorders.
More research is needed to determine whether these people can also safely drink up to a few hours before surgery.
