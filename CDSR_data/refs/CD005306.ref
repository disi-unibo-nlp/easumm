This review examines the net impact of providing written action plans to children with asthma and their parents We did not find any trial examining the benefit of providing versus not providing a written action plan to children with asthma.
Four clinical trials with 355 children were identified which compared the effect of symptom‐based versus to peak flow written action plans when all other co‐interventions were similar.
Children assigned to a symptom‐based plan less frequently required an acute care visit for asthma compared to those who received a peak flow based plan.
Most other outcomes were similar with the exception of more children intending to continue using the symptom‐based compared to the peak‐flow based written action plan.
