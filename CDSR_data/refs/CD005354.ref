Recombinant FSH versus urinary gonadotrophins (HMG, purified FSH, highly purified FSH) for ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF and ICSI cycles Several systematic reviews compared recombinant FSH with urinary gonadotrophins (HMG, purified FSH, highly purified FSH) for ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF and ICSI cycles and these reported conflicting results.
We included 42 trials with in total 9606 couples.
Comparing rFSH with urinary gonadotrophins overall did not result in any difference in live birth rate, OHSS or any of the other outcomes.
Comparing rFSH with HMG/HP‐HMG resulted in a significantly lower live birth rate in the rFSH group though differences were small.
There was no proof of a difference in live birth when comparing rFSH with FSH‐P or with FSH‐HP.
We may conclude that all these gonadotrophins are equally effective and safe, and that further trials are unwarranted.
