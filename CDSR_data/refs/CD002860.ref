Nitric oxide donors for the treatment of preterm labour Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) increases the baby's risk of death or disability.
Several drugs are available to try and slow down labour so that corticosteroid drugs can be given to help the baby's lungs mature quickly.
Nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) are drugs that may slow down contractions.
They can cause headaches, low blood pressure and increased heart rate for the mother, but they might cause fewer problems than some of the other options.
This review gathered the evidence on nitric oxide donors compared with no treatment and compared with other drugs to inhibit preterm labour.
We identified 12 trials involving 1227 women.
We found that there is not enough evidence to show whether or not nitric oxide donors can slow down preterm labour.
