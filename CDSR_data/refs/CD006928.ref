Macular translocation for age‐related macular degeneration It is unclear if macular translocation can improve vision in patients with wet AMD, the form of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) caused by the abnormal growth of new blood vessels in the region of the central retina called macula.
Age‐related macular degeneration leads to the development of a blind spot in the centre of the visual field and is the most common cause of legal blindness among the elderly in the western world.
Macular translocation is a surgical procedure that involves the detachment of the retina which includes the macula into a less‐damaged area.
Some ophthalmologists have suggested that this surgery can help patients improve vision.
We found a small study suggesting that vision might improve, but severe complications can arise during the process of retinal displacement.
Thus, macular translocation might not be considered for most patients with wet AMD given the treatment options already available.
