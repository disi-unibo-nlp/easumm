Endothelin receptor antagonists for persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension Background:  Some newborn babies develop abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lung.
This condition is called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
Babies with PPHN present with breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels.Traditionally such babies are managed with respirators and administration of a special gas called nitric oxide.
In many cases, babies do not improve in spite of these measures.
A new class of drugs called endothelin receptor antagonists are being tested for PPHN.
Method:  We systematically reviewed the medical literature through December 2015 to gather current evidence on the use of this class of drugs in newborn babies.
Results:  We found very limited data from two included studies for the use of this class of drugs in newborn babies.
Overall, the quality of evidence was considered low because of the very small sample size and methodological issues in the included studies.
Conclusion:  More research is needed to find out if endothelin receptor antagonists are useful in newborn babies with PPHN.
At present the use of these medications for this condition can not be recommended.
