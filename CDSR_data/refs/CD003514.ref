Bed rest with or without hospitalisation for hypertension during pregnancy Not enough evidence to say if bed rest in pregnancy helps women and their babies when women have high blood pressure.
High blood pressure in pregnant women can contribute to babies being small, being born too soon and having considerable health problems.
Women with high blood pressure are often advised to rest in bed either at home or in hospital.
It is suggested that this might help to reduce the mother's blood pressure and so provide benefits for the baby.
However, there may be adverse effects; for example, some women may find it stressful, it may contribute to blood clots in the legs and can put a burden on the woman's family.
Although one small trial suggested that there may be some possible benefits, there are insufficient data to be confident.
Moreover, trials did not address possible adverse effects of bed rest.
More women seemed to prefer normal activity at home rather than resting in hospital, if a choice were given.
Further research is needed.
