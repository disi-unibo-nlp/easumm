"Background Seizures after stroke are an important clinical problem and may result in poor outcomes. The indications of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure prophylaxis after stroke remain unclear. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of AEDs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke. For primary prevention, we aimed to assess whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in people who have a stroke but do not have a seizure. For secondary prevention, we aimed to assess whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in people who have a stroke and at least one post‐stroke seizure. Search methods We searched the following databases on 9 March 2021: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to March 08, 2021). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy and Stroke. We also checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from these searches. Selection criteria We selected randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies that recruited participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic. We excluded studies that only recruited participants with subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, or other non‐stroke diagnoses such as tumour‐ or infection‐related infarction or haemorrhage. We also excluded studies that recruited only participants who had undergone neurosurgery. We included participants of all ages suffering any seizure type who were assigned to AEDs or placebo groups. Data collection and analysis In accordance with standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion before evaluating trial risk of bias and extracting relevant data. The primary outcome assessed was the proportion of participants who experienced seizures in the follow‐up period. We presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Where we had sufficient data, we calculated random‐effects (Mantel‐Haenszel) meta‐analyses for dichotomous outcomes; otherwise, we reported results narratively. We used the I 2  statistic to analyse statistical heterogeneity. We planned to use funnel plots to assess publication bias in meta‐analyses with at least 10 included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results Two studies with a total of 856 subjects were included. AEDs were not shown to be effective in primary prophylaxis of post‐stroke seizure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.26; 2 studies, 856 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The first study was a randomised double‐blind study comparing valproic acid with placebo for primary seizure prevention up to one year after stroke. The study included 72 adults with intracerebral haemorrhage. There was no difference in the risk of post‐stroke seizures (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.16) or of death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.58). The second study was a substudy on the use of diazepam in acute stroke. It was a randomised double‐blind study, comparing a three‐day diazepam treatment versus placebo for primary seizure prevention up to three months after stroke in 784 adults with acute stroke. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of post‐stroke seizures for all stroke or subgroups of haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke (RR for all stroke 0.47, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.22). In a subgroup analysis of anterior circulation cortical infarcts, primary prophylaxis with diazepam was associated with a reduced risk of post‐stroke seizures (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.95). Risks of mortality did not differ between the diazepam and the placebo group at two weeks (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.26) and three months follow‐up (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26). We assessed both studies to be at a low overall risk of bias. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence as low to moderate. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of AEDs on the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke. Further well‐conducted studies are warranted for this important clinical problem.","Effects of antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke Review question Is there evidence to support the routine use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke? Background Seizures after a stroke are clinically important. It is unclear whether AEDs are effective in preventing seizures after a stroke in adults. Results We found two prospective randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials, assessing the effect of AEDs on primary seizure prevention after stroke. The first study included 72 adults, comparing valproic acid with placebo, and it showed no difference in post‐stroke seizure between the intervention and controlled group. The second study included 784 adults, comparing diazepam with placebo, and it showed no difference in post‐stroke seizure between the diazepam group and placebo group. However, a subgroup analysis of the anterior circulation cortical infarcts showed a possible benefit with prophylactic diazepam within the first three months after stroke. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of AEDs to prevent seizures after stroke. Further research on whether AED prophylaxis is indicated in all strokes or in strokes with specific characteristics is warranted. Quality of the evidence We assessed the included studies to be at an overall low risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence to be low to moderate. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in estimation of effect and may change the conclusions. The evidence is current to 9 March 2021.",CD005398
"Background In people with acute ischaemic stroke, platelets become activated and can cause blood clots to form and block an artery in the brain, resulting in damage to part of the brain. Such damage gives rise to the symptoms of stroke. Antiplatelet therapy might reduce the volume of brain damaged by ischaemia and also reduce the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, thereby reducing the risk of early death and improving long‐term outcomes in survivors. However, antiplatelet therapy might also increase the risk of fatal or disabling intracranial haemorrhage. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of immediate oral antiplatelet therapy (i.e. started as soon as possible and no later than two weeks after stroke onset) in people with acute presumed ischaemic stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and two trials registers, and performed forward reference/cited reference searching in August 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antiplatelet therapy (started within 14 days of the stroke) with control in people with definite or presumed ischaemic stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and assessed trial quality. For the included trials, they extracted and cross‐checked the data. They assessed risk of bias of each study using the Risk of Bias 1 (RoB1) tool and overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 11 studies involving 42,226 participants. Three new trials have been added since the last update (743 participants). As per the previous version of this review, two trials testing aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg once daily, started within 48 hours of onset, contributed 96% of the data. The risk of bias was low. The maximum follow‐up was six months. With treatment, there was a decrease in death or dependency at the end of follow‐up (odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 0.99; 7 RCTs, 42,034 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). For every 1000 people treated with aspirin, 13 people would avoid death or dependency (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 79). Authors' conclusions Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg daily, given orally (or by nasogastric tube or per rectum in people who cannot swallow) and started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke, significantly decreased death and dependency, and reduced the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications; long‐term outcomes were improved.","Oral antiplatelet therapy for acute ischaemic stroke Review question We wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of oral antiplatelet therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke to see if oral antiplatelet medicines reduced the number of deaths and improved the long‐term outcomes in survivors. Background Most strokes are caused by a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain that is usually due to a blood clot (called an ischaemic stroke). Immediate treatment with antiplatelet medicines such as aspirin may prevent new clots from forming and hence improve recovery after stroke. However, antiplatelet medicines may also cause bleeding in the brain, which could offset any benefits. Study characteristics We identified 11 studies, up to August 2020, for inclusion in the review. These studies included 42,226 participants. Three new trials have been added since the last update. As per the previous version of this review, two studies contributed 96% of the data. Most participants in the review were elderly, with a significant proportion over 70 years of age. Males and females were almost equally represented in the trials. There appeared to be some variation in stroke severity among the included trials. The scheduled duration of treatment varied from five days to three months and the scheduled follow‐up period varied from 10 days to six months. Key results Aspirin, at a dose of 160 mg to 300 mg daily, started within 48 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, saved lives and reduced the risk of further stroke occurring in the first two weeks. If treatment was started more than 48 hours after onset but within 14 days, the limited evidence from this review and other external data suggest that aspirin is of benefit even starting at this late stage. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg daily, given orally (or by a tube through the nose and into the stomach or by the rectum in people who cannot swallow) and started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke, reduced the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications; long‐term outcomes were improved. Almost all the evidence in this review came from trials of aspirin. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence contributing to these results was generally good.",CD000029
"Background Infants born at term by elective caesarean section are more likely to develop respiratory morbidity than infants born vaginally. Prophylactic corticosteroids in singleton preterm pregnancies accelerate lung maturation and reduce the incidence of respiratory complications. It is unclear whether administration at term gestations, prior to caesarean section, improves the respiratory outcomes for these babies without causing any unnecessary morbidity to the mother or the infant. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effect of prophylactic corticosteroid administration before elective caesarean section at term, as compared to usual care (which could be placebo or no treatment), on fetal, neonatal and maternal morbidity. We also assessed the impact of the treatment on the child in later life. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register,  ClinicalTrials.gov  (20 January 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antenatal corticosteroid administration (betamethasone or dexamethasone) with placebo or with no treatment, given before elective caesarean section at term (at or after 37 weeks of gestation). Quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised controlled trials were also eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness (based on predefined criteria developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth), extracted data and checked them for accuracy and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnoea of the neonate (TTN), admission to neonatal special care for respiratory morbidity and need for mechanical ventilation. We planned to perform subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes according to gestational age at randomisation and type of corticosteroid (betamethasone or dexamethasone). We also planned to perform sensitivity analysis, including only studies at low risk of bias. Main results We included one trial in which participants were randomised to receive either betamethasone or usual care. The trial included 942 women and 942 neonates recruited from 10 UK hospitals between 1995 and 2002. This review includes only trials that met predefined criteria for trustworthiness. We removed three trials from the analysis that were included in the previous version of this review. The risk of bias was low for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. The risk of bias for selective outcome reporting was unclear because there was no published trial protocol, and therefore it is unclear whether all the planned outcomes were reported in full. Due to a lack of blinding we judged there to be high risk of performance bias and detection bias. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of concerns about risk of bias and because of imprecision due to low event rates and wide 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which are consistent with possible benefit and possible harm Compared with usual care, it is uncertain if antenatal corticosteroids reduce the risk of RDS (relative risk (RR) 0.34 95% CI 0.07 to 1.65; 1 study; 942 infants) or TTN (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.11; 1 study; 938 infants) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs are consistent with possible benefit and possible harm. Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of admission to neonatal special care for respiratory complications, compared with usual care (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.90; 1 study; 942 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The proportion of infants admitted to neonatal special care for respiratory morbidity after treatment with antenatal corticosteroids was 2.3% compared with 5.1% in the usual care group. It is uncertain if antenatal steroids have any effect on the risk of needing mechanical ventilation, compared with usual care (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.27; 1 study; 942 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). The effect of antenatal corticosteroids on the maternal development of postpartum infection/pyrexia in the first 72 hours is unclear due to the very low certainty of the evidence; one study (942 women) reported zero cases. The included studies did not report any data for neonatal hypoglycaemia or maternal mortality/severe morbidity. Authors' conclusions Evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests that prophylactic corticosteroids before elective caesarean section at term probably reduces admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory morbidity. It is uncertain if administration of antenatal corticosteroids reduces the rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or transient tachypnoea of the neonate (TTN). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes was found to be low or very low, apart from the outcome of admission to neonatal special care (all levels) for respiratory morbidity, for which the evidence was of moderate certainty. Therefore, there is currently insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions.  More evidence is needed to investigate the effect of prophylactic antenatal corticosteroids on the incidence of recognised respiratory morbidity such as RDS. Any future trials should assess the balance between respiratory benefit and potential immediate adverse effects (e.g. hypoglycaemia) and long‐term adverse effects (e.g. academic performance) for the infant. There is very limited information on maternal health outcomes to provide any assurances that corticosteroids do not pose any increased risk of harm to the mother.  Further research should consider investigating the effectiveness of antenatal steroids at different gestational ages prior to caesarean section. There are nine potentially eligible studies that are currently ongoing and could be included in future updates of this review.","Corticosteroids for preventing serious breathing problems in the newborn after caesarean section at term What is the issue? Babies born at term (at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy) by planned (elective) caesarean section, before onset of labour, are more likely to develop breathing complications than babies born vaginally. Giving injections called corticosteroids to the mother has been shown to reduce the risk of breathing problems in babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy, but it is not clear if they are also useful for babies born by caesarean section at term. Why is this important? Caesarean section increases the risk of a term newborn developing breathing problems, such as rapid breathing over the first few days (known as transient tachypnoea of the neonate) and the more serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The affected babies may need treatment in special care units. This risk decreases from 37 weeks to 39 weeks of gestation, at which stage it is low. Most caesarean sections are performed after 39 weeks of gestation, but there are some instances when babies need to be born earlier. The aim of this review was to investigate if corticosteroids can reduce the rates of breathing problems prior to caesarean section, without causing problems for the mother or the infant. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies that met our criteria for being trustworthy and compared the effects of corticosteroids against a placebo (dummy) treatment or against usual care. We rated our confidence in the findings based on factors such as the number of studies, study methods, number of women and babies involved, the number of events and the variability of the findings. What evidence did we find? We included evidence up until 20 January 2021. We included one trial that involved 942 women and 942 babies recruited from 10 UK hospitals. The women in the treatment group received two doses of the corticosteroid betamethasone by injection into the muscle. The women in the control group received usual care. No blinding procedures were used therefore all the women, caregivers and investigators were aware of who received corticosteroids and who received usual care. It is uncertain if corticosteroids reduce the risk of transient tachypnoea of the neonate (a mild breathing problem) or respiratory distress syndrome (i.e serious breathing problems) compared with usual care. Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of admission to neonatal special care for breathing complications compared with usual care. It is uncertain if corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of the baby needing additional breathing support (mechanical ventilation) compared with usual care. It is uncertain if antenatal corticosteroids have any effect on women developing infection or high temperature within 72 hours of giving birth (there were no cases in the one study involving 942 women).  We did not find any evidence about the baby's risk of low blood sugar or about the woman's risk of serious illness, death or wound infection. Certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence from the included randomised trial was very low to moderate. This means that we can not be completely confident that future trials will come to the same conclusions about the treatment benefits for the babies of mothers receiving a course of antenatal corticosteroids prior to caesarean section at term. What does this mean? The risk of being admitted to neonatal special care because of breathing problems was reduced in one study. It is uncertain if corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of serious breathing problems (respiratory distress syndrome) or rapid breathing (transient tachypnoea) in the neonate, compared with usual care. Further studies are needed to investigate if antenatal corticosteroids do reduce the risk of serious respiratory problems (such as respiratory distress syndrome). Future trials need to make sure they assess for possible short‐ and long‐term harm to both mother and baby after receiving a course of antenatal corticosteroids prior to caesarean section at term. Further research could consider assessing whether any benefits or harms identified by giving a course of antenatal corticosteroids are affected by the gestational age at which the planned caesarean is performed.   There are nine potentially eligible studies that are currently ongoing and could be included in future updates of this review.",CD006614
"Background Disease‐related malnutrition has been reported in 10% to 55% of people in hospital and the community and is associated with significant health and social‐care costs. Dietary advice (DA) encouraging consumption of energy‐ and nutrient‐rich foods rather than oral nutritional supplements (ONS) may be an initial treatment. Objectives To examine evidence that DA with/without ONS in adults with disease‐related malnutrition improves survival, weight, anthropometry and quality of life (QoL). Search methods We identified relevant publications from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching. Last search: 01 March 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DA with/without ONS in adults with disease‐related malnutrition in any healthcare setting compared with no advice, ONS or DA alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, extracted data and graded evidence. Main results We included 94, mostly parallel, RCTs (102 comparisons; 10,284 adults) across many conditions possibly explaining the high heterogeneity.  Participants were mostly older people in hospital, residential care and the community, with limited reporting on their sex. Studies lasted from one month to 6.5 years.  DA versus no advice ‐ 24 RCTs (3523 participants) Most outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.96), or at later time points. We had no three‐month data, but advice may make little or no difference to hospitalisations, or days in hospital after four to six months and up to 12 months. A similar effect was seen for complications at up to three months, MD 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.32) and between four and six months. Advice may improve weight after three months, MD 0.97 kg (95% CI 0.06 to 1.87) continuing at four to six months and up to 12 months; and may result in a greater gain in fat‐free mass (FFM) after 12 months, but not earlier. It may also improve global QoL at up to three months, MD 3.30 (95% CI 1.47 to 5.13), but not later. DA versus ONS ‐ 12 RCTs (852 participants) All outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.26), or at later time points. Either intervention may make little or no difference to hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.04 to 3.24), but ONS may reduce hospitalisations up to six months. There was little or no difference between groups in weight change at three months, MD ‐0.14 kg (95% CI ‐2.01 to 1.74), or between four to six months. Advice (one study) may lead to better global QoL scores but only after 12 months. No study reported days in hospital, complications or FFM. DA versus DA plus ONS ‐ 22 RCTs (1286 participants) Most outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.80) or at later time points. At three months advice may lead to fewer hospitalisations, RR 1.70 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.77), but not at up to six months. There may be little or no effect on length of hospital stay at up to three months, MD ‐1.07 (95% CI ‐4.10 to 1.97). At three months DA plus ONS may lead to fewer complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI o.56 to 0.99); greater weight gain, MD 1.15 kg (95% CI 0.42 to 1.87); and better global QoL scores, MD 0.33 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57), but this was not seen at other time points. There was no effect on FFM at three months. DA plus ONS if required versus no advice or ONS ‐ 31 RCTs (3308 participants) Evidence was moderate‐ to low‐certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality at three months, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.16) or at later time points. Similarly, little or no effect on hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.15), at four to six months and up to 12 months; on days in hospital at three months, MD ‐0.12 (95% CI ‐2.48 to 2.25) or for complications at any time point. At three months, advice plus ONS probably improve weight, MD 1.25 kg (95% CI 0.73 to 1.76) and may improve FFM, 0.82 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.29), but these effects were not seen later. There may be little or no effect of either intervention on global QoL scores at three months, but advice plus ONS may improve scores at up to 12 months. DA plus ONS versus no advice or ONS ‐ 13 RCTs (1315 participants) Evidence was low‐ to very low‐certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.52) or at later time points. No study reported hospitalisations and there may be little or no effect on days in hospital after three months, MD ‐1.81 (95% CI ‐3.65 to 0.04) or six months. Advice plus ONS may lead to fewer complications up to three months, MD 0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.89) (one study). Interventions may make little or no difference to weight at three months, MD 1.08 kg (95% CI ‐0.17 to 2.33); however, advice plus ONS may improve weight at four to six months and up to 12 months. Interventions may make little or no difference in FFM or global QoL scores at any time point. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of an effect of any intervention on mortality. There may be weight gain with DA and with DA plus ONS in the short term, but the benefits of DA when compared with ONS are uncertain. The size and direction of effect and the length of intervention and follow‐up required for benefits to emerge were inconsistent for all other outcomes.  There were too few data for many outcomes to allow meaningful conclusions. Studies focusing on both patient‐centred and healthcare outcomes are needed to address the questions in this review.","Advice on diet for adults with malnutrition that is the result of disease Review question Can dietary advice with or without oral nutritional supplements (ONS) improve disease‐related malnutrition in adults? Background Ill people often have a poor appetite or feel sick because of medicines or other treatments and eat less than usual. Eating less over a longer time can cause weight loss, malnutrition, more health problems and death. Healthcare professionals may offer advice about dietary changes to help people to re‐establish good eating habits. They might recommend high‐protein and high‐energy foods so that these people can gain weight and improve their nutrition and general health. It is common for sick people to be offered ONS with or without advice about changing their food intake. To find the best answer to our review question, we looked for studies that compared five different treatment options: dietary advice compared with no advice; dietary advice compared with ONS; dietary advice plus ONS compared with dietary advice; dietary advice plus ONS if appropriate compared with no dietary advice; and dietary advice plus ONS compared with no dietary advice and no ONS. To make these comparisons fair, we looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where the people taking part had an equal chance (like the flip of a coin) of being in either group that was being compared.  Search date The evidence is current to: 01 March 2021. Study characteristics We found 94 studies (with a total of 10,284 people) that we could include in our review. Although older people have a higher risk of malnutrition, the people in these studies ranged from 17 to over 80 years of age and they were living either at home, in the community, or in hospital. They had a wide range of health conditions, including cancer, dementia and kidney disease. The studies reported on the participants for the length of their hospital stay or in some people in the community for up to six and a half years. Key results There is no evidence that any of the treatments affected how long many of the people in the studies lived. They did report some positive changes in energy intake (measured in calories), protein intake, weight, muscle bulk and quality of life. There were some reductions in complications and the length of time spent in hospital. However, there is no clear evidence about which treatment is the most helpful or the time it takes to achieve any benefit. Few studies reported results separately for men and women and so we cannot comment on whether there were any overall differences by sex. No studies recorded information about adverse events (harms) so we cannot offer a summary about possible harms. More research is needed to work out the best ways to help people who are losing weight because of illness in order to improve their clinical outcomes and quality of life. Certainty of the evidence Overall we rated the certainty of the evidence as low for most results, which means that we cannot be confident about the findings we report. There were several reasons for this. Some of the treatment comparisons that we looked at had only a few studies  and some of those had small numbers of participants. There were problems with the design of some studies that may have affected the results. Some people knew which treatment they were receiving. We think this may influence the way that they reported some changes, e.g. their energy and protein intake, body weight and quality of life. We think that the way the decision about which group a person went into at the start of the study may have affected the  results for some outcomes, e.g. change in weight, change in muscle bulk and mortality. We needed to see particular results to help us understand whether adults living with disease‐related malnutrition can improve their survival, weight and general quality of life if they receive advice about diet with or without ONS. None of the studies reported all of the results that we needed to do this. We were not able to estimate whether participants gain any benefits from the treatments, such as shortening the length of hospital stay, lowering the risk of readmission to hospital or developing complications. The low certainty of evidence, with no evidence in many areas, means we cannot  make statements about any benefits and the possible disadvantages of these treatments despite the fact they are being used extensively in clinical practice. We recommend that future studies should be designed to measure these important patient‐centred and healthcare outcomes as well as any potential harms.",CD002008
"Background A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function caused by lack of blood supply. Stroke can lead to death or physical and cognitive impairment and can have long lasting psychological and social implications. Research shows that stroke survivors and their families are dissatisfied with the information provided and have a poor understanding of stroke and associated issues. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the effects of active or passive information provision for stroke survivors (people with a clinical diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)) or their identified carers. The primary outcomes are knowledge about stroke and stroke services, and anxiety. Search methods We updated our searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register on 28 September 2020 and for the following databases to May/June 2019: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 5) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; 2019, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library (searched 31 May 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (searched 2005 to May week 4, 2019), Embase Ovid (searched 2005 to 29 May 2019), CINAHL EBSCO (searched 2005 to 6 June 2019), and five others. We searched seven study registers and checked reference lists of reviews. Selection criteria Randomised trials involving stroke survivors, their identified carers or both, where an information intervention was compared with standard care, or where information and another therapy were compared with the other therapy alone, or where the comparison was between active and passive information provision without other differences in treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We categorised interventions as either active information provision or passive information provision: active information provision included active participation with subsequent opportunities for clarification and reinforcement; passive information provision provided no systematic follow‐up or reinforcement procedure. We stratified analyses by this categorisation. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. Main results We have added 12 new studies in this update. This review now includes 33 studies involving 5255 stroke‐survivor and 3134 carer participants. Twenty‐two trials evaluated active information provision interventions and 11 trials evaluated passive information provision interventions. Most trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors where outcomes were self‐reported. Fewer than half of studies were at low risk of bias regarding random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, incomplete outcome data or selective reporting. The following estimates have low certainty, based on the quality of evidence, unless stated otherwise. Accounting for certainty and size of effect, analyses suggested that for stroke survivors, active information provision may improve stroke‐related knowledge (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.65; 3 studies, 275 participants), may reduce cases of anxiety and depression slightly (anxiety risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 5 studies, 1132 participants; depression RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 6 studies, 1315 participants), may reduce Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety score slightly, (mean difference (MD) ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.10 to ‐0.36; 6 studies, 1171 participants), probably reduces HADS depression score slightly (MD (rescaled from SMD) ‐0.8, 95% CI ‐1.27 to ‐0.34; 8 studies, 1405 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and may improve each domain of the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment short‐form (WHOQOL‐BREF) (physical, MD 11.5, 95% CI 7.81 to 15.27; psychological, MD 11.8, 95% CI 7.29 to 16.29; social, MD 5.8, 95% CI 0.84 to 10.84; environment, MD 7.0, 95% CI 3.00 to 10.94; 1 study, 60 participants). No studies evaluated positive mental well‐being. For carers, active information provision may reduce HADS anxiety and depression scores slightly (MD for anxiety ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.51 to 0.70; 3 studies, 921 participants; MD for depression ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐1.53 to 0.92; 3 studies, 924 participants), may result in little to no difference in positive mental well‐being assessed with Bradley's well‐being questionnaire (MD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐1.34 to 0.98; 1 study, 91 participants) and may result in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (MD 1.22, 95% CI ‐7.65 to 10.09; 1 study, 91 participants). The evidence is very uncertain (very low certainty) for the effects of active information provision on carers' stroke‐related knowledge, and cases of anxiety and depression. For stroke survivors, passive information provision may slightly increase HADS anxiety and depression scores (MD for anxiety 0.67, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 1.71; MD for depression 0.39, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 1.38; 3 studies, 227 participants) and the evidence is very uncertain for the effects on stroke‐related knowledge, quality of life, and cases of anxiety and depression. For carers, the evidence is very uncertain for the effects of passive information provision on stroke‐related knowledge, and HADS anxiety and depression scores. No studies of passive information provision measured carer quality of life, or stroke‐survivor or carer positive mental well‐being. Authors' conclusions Active information provision may improve stroke‐survivor knowledge and quality of life, and may reduce anxiety and depression. However, the reductions in anxiety and depression scores were small and may not be important. In contrast, providing information passively may slightly worsen stroke‐survivor anxiety and depression scores, although again the importance of this is unclear. Evidence relating to carers and to other outcomes of passive information provision is generally very uncertain. Although the best way to provide information is still unclear, the evidence is better for strategies that actively involve stroke survivors and carers and include planned follow‐up for clarification and reinforcement.","Providing information to stroke survivors and their carers What was the review about? We reviewed the evidence about the effects of providing information to people after stroke. These were people who have had a stroke or mini‐stroke (transient ischaemic attack (TIA)), or their carers, such as friends and family. We mainly looked at the effect on their knowledge of stroke and stroke care, their mood and their quality of life. Background A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function caused by lack of blood supply. Stroke can lead to death or physical and mental problems. It can have a major effect on the person's life and those around them. Stroke survivors and their carers often say they have not been given enough facts about stroke. They often do not feel ready for life after leaving hospital. Some people say they were overwhelmed. The information was not explained to them or was given at the wrong time. Information may help people to manage their health better and adjust to life after stroke. We wanted to know whether it was better or worse to be given extra information. We also wanted to know if the way information was provided matters. Study characteristics We found 33 studies involving 5255 stroke survivors and 3134 carers. In 11 studies, information was provided passively as a leaflet, DVD, medical history or personalised booklet. In 22 studies, information was provided actively, often combining ways such as talks, demonstrations, meetings and phone calls. Key results For stroke survivors, providing information actively may improve knowledge of stroke and stroke care. It may slightly reduce anxiety and depression, but this may not be noticeable. It may also improve quality of life. The evidence was less clear for providing information passively. However, it may slightly worsen anxiety and depression. Again, this may not be by a noticeable amount. For carers the evidence is very uncertain or absent. Confidence in the evidence We generally had low or very low confidence in the evidence. We were moderately confident that the depressive symptoms of stroke survivors were slightly reduced by active information provision. Our confidence was often limited by the following factors. • The people in the studies knew if they were giving or receiving more information than usual. This may have affected what they did or how they said they felt. • Too few people had been studied. • The results were not precise, so they could show either benefit or harm. • The results of individual studies did not agree with each other enough. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies in May and June 2019 and searched one source again in September 2020. The studies were published between 1987 and 2019.",CD001919
"Background Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Without treatment, approximately 30% of patients will experience spontaneous remission and one third will have persistent proteinuria. Approximately one‐third of patients progress toward end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. Immunosuppressive treatment aims to protect kidney function and is recommended for patients who do not show improvement of proteinuria by supportive therapy, and for patients with severe nephrotic syndrome at presentation due to the high risk of developing ESKD. The efficacy and safety of different immunosuppressive regimens are unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review, first published in 2004 and updated in 2013. Objectives The aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different immunosuppressive treatments for adult patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 April 2021 with support from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects of immunosuppression in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome were included. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data synthesis were performed using Cochrane‐recommended methods. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results Sixty‐five studies (3807 patients) were included. Most studies exhibited a high risk of bias for the domains, blinding of study personnel, participants and outcome assessors, and most studies were judged unclear for randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment. Immunosuppressive treatment versus placebo/no treatment/non‐immunosuppressive treatment In moderate certainty evidence, immunosuppressive treatment probably makes little or no difference to death, probably reduces the overall risk of ESKD (16 studies, 944 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99; I² = 22%), probably increases total remission (complete and partial) (6 studies, 879 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97; I² = 73%) and complete remission (16 studies, 879 participants: RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.75; I² = 43%), and probably decreases the number with doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (9 studies, 447 participants: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.80; I² = 21%). However, immunosuppressive treatment may increase the number of patients relapsing after complete or partial remission (3 studies, 148 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.86; I² = 0%) and may lead to a greater number experiencing temporary or permanent discontinuation/hospitalisation due to adverse events (18 studies, 927 participants: RR 5.33, 95% CI 2.19 to 12.98; I² = 0%). Immunosuppressive treatment has uncertain effects on infection and malignancy. Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids versus placebo/no treatment/steroids Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids had uncertain effects on death but may reduce the overall risk of ESKD (9 studies, 537 participants: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Total (9 studies, 468 participants: RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; I² = 70%) and complete remission (8 studies, 432 participants: RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.38; I² = 37%) may increase, but had uncertain effects on the number of patients relapsing, and decreasing the number with doubling of SCr. Alkylating agents may be associated with a higher rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation or hospitalisation (8 studies 439 participants: RR 6.82, 95% CI 2.24 to 20.71; I² = 0%). Oral alkylating agents with or without steroids had uncertain effects on infection and malignancy. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with or without steroids versus placebo/no treatment/supportive therapy/steroids We are uncertain whether CNI with or without steroids increased or decreased the risk of death or ESKD, increased or decreased total or complete remission, or reduced relapse after complete or partial remission (low to very low certainty evidence). CNI also had uncertain effects on decreasing the number with a doubling of SCr, temporary or permanent discontinuation or hospitalisation due to adverse events, infection, or malignancy. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with or without steroids versus alkylating agents with or without steroids We are uncertain whether CNI with or without steroids increases or decreases the risk of death or ESKD. CNI with or without steroids may make little or no difference to total remission (10 studies, 538 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15; I² = 53%; moderate certainty evidence) or complete remission (10 studies, 538 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.56; I² = 56%; low certainty evidence). CNI with or without steroids may increase relapse after complete or partial remission. CNI with or without steroids had uncertain effects on SCr increase, adverse events, infection, and malignancy. Other immunosuppressive treatments Other interventions included azathioprine, mizoribine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, traditional Chinese medicines, and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions on these treatments. Authors' conclusions This updated review strengthened the evidence that immunosuppressive therapy is probably superior to non‐immunosuppressive therapy in inducing remission and reducing the number of patients that progress to ESKD. However, these benefits need to be balanced against the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. The number of included studies with high‐quality design was relatively small and most studies did not have adequate follow‐up. Clinicians should inform their patients of the lack of high‐quality evidence. An alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) combined with a corticosteroid regimen had short‐ and long‐term benefits, but this was associated with a higher rate of adverse events. CNI (tacrolimus and cyclosporin) showed equivalency with alkylating agents however, the certainty of this evidence remains low. Novel immunosuppressive treatments with the biologic rituximab or use of adrenocorticotropic hormone require further investigation and validation in large and high‐quality RCTs.","Immunosuppressive treatment for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy What is the issue? Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the kidneys. The term ""primary"" is used to describe membranous nephropathy that is not caused by another disease in the body. PMN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition, where the membrane of the kidney is damaged and becomes permeable for proteins. Primary membranous nephropathy is diagnosed through findings in a kidney biopsy and the presence of nephrotic syndrome. PMN is not harmful in about one‐third of patients, who will have a spontaneous ""complete remission"", which means that the disease will resolve by itself. However, about another one third will experience spontaneous remission but will have some protein in the urine that continues with normal kidney function. These patients usually only require supportive treatments that do not interact with the immune system. Without treatment, about 15% to 50% of patients progress to end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) within 10 years. In some patients, PMN can be severe or continues to get worse even after using 6 months of supportive treatments. In these patients, extra treatment that dampens the activity of the immune system may be used to reduce damage to the kidney. It is not clear which of these treatment(s) is the most helpful and what side effects can occur. Therefore, the duration and intensity of immunosuppressive treatment need to be balanced against possible side effects. There are different classes of drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (drugs based on the body's stress response hormone cortisol). What did we do? We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant specialised register up to 1 April 2021. We have combined studies to compare different treatment regimens with immunosuppressive therapy to assess which treatments help to treat patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with the least side effects. What did we find? This review identified sixty‐five studies with 3807 patients. Different types of immunosuppressive treatment include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), biologicals (e.g. rituximab) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. These drugs may or may not be combined with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), which also suppresses the immune system. After combining the results of available studies together, we found that compared with no treatment, supportive treatment or steroids alone, the use of immunosuppressive treatment probably reduced the number of patients who progressed to ESKD by about 40% and increased the number of patients that achieved complete remission. However, immunosuppressive treatment may lead to more adverse events, which can cause treatment to be stopped or lead to the patients needing to go to hospital. The different drugs that can be used in the immunosuppressive treatment were also examined in our review. We found that alkylating agents probably increases complete remission but may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain whether alkylating agents increase infection or cancer. Based on the currently available evidence, the effectiveness of using calcineurin inhibitors is still unclear, but there is low certainty of the evidence, that CNI may lead to similar remission rates compared to alkylating agents. Furthermore, other treatment options such as mycophenolate mofetil, adrenocorticotropic hormone, rituximab and others have only been examined in a few studies. There is not enough data to draw final conclusions on the use of these treatments in adults with PMN and nephrotic syndrome.    Conclusions The treatment of patients with PMN and nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive therapy compared to no treatment or supportive therapy alone probably protects the kidney but may increase side effects. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids may decrease disease activity and the use of alkylating agent combined with steroids probably has the short‐term and long‐term benefits of limiting damage to the kidney. Other therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less certainty regarding their safety and effectiveness from these studies.",CD004293
"Background Conventional treatment of X‐linked hypophosphatemia with oral phosphate and calcitriol can heal rickets, but it does not always raise serum phosphate concentrations significantly, nor does it always normalize linear growth. Some clinical trials suggest that combining recombinant human growth hormone therapy with conventional treatment improves growth velocity, phosphate retention, and bone mineral density, but some clinical trials suggest that it appears to aggravate the pre‐existent disproportionate stature of such children. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether recombinant human growth hormone therapy for children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia is associated with changes in longitudinal growth, mineral metabolism, endocrine function, renal function, bone mineral density, body proportions, and also with any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE and the reference lists of identified trials and other reviews. We also undertook some additional handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 12 January 2021 Selection criteria All randomized controlled studies or quasi‐randomized controlled studies comparing growth hormone (alone or combined with conventional treatment) with either placebo or conventional treatment alone in children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for risk of bias and extracted data from eligible studies. GRADE criteria were used to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included two studies (20 participants) in the review. In one cross‐over study, results showed that recombinant human growth hormone therapy may improve the height standard deviation (SDS) score (z score), but we are unsure whether the intervention was the reason behind a transient increase in serum phosphate and tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption. In the second, parallel study, treatment may also have improved the height SDS from baseline in the rhGH group compared to the control group, although no significant difference was seen between groups after three years, MD 0.50 SDS (95 % CI ‐0.54 to 1.54) (low‐certainty evidence). The treatment was possibly well‐tolerated during both studies with only transient adverse effects seen in three participants (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether growth hormone improves serum phosphate levels or change in TmP/GFR (very low‐certainty evidence). The treatment may make little or no difference to alkaline phosphatase levels (low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We do not have enough high‐certainty evidence to recommend the use of recombinant human growth hormone therapy in children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia.","Synthetic human growth hormone for treating X‐linked hypophosphatemia (or vitamin D‐resistant rickets) in children Review question Can human growth hormone lead to improved clinical outcomes (such as increased growth and bone mineral density, as well as better kidney and hormone function) without side effects in children with X‐linked hypophosphataemia? Background X‐linked hypophosphataemia is a genetic disorder which causes abnormal levels of phosphate in the body. This can lead to short stature and rickets. Standard treatment of X‐linked hypophosphatemia can heal rickets, but does not always raise the level of phosphates in the blood or return growth levels to normal. It is unclear whether combining human growth hormone therapy with standard treatment improves the phosphate levels, growth rates and bone mineral density. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 January 2021 Study characteristics We included two small studies with a total of 20 children aged between 2.5 and nine years old in this review.  There were equal numbers of boys and girls. Both trials were randomised so that participants had an equal chance of being put in the growth hormone group or the control group (children in the control group either got no additional treatment or a placebo (sham) treatment). One (parallel) trial compared children given the growth hormone to children who did not have any treatment for three years. The second trial was a cross‐over trial, so to start with one group of children were given human growth hormone therapy and the second group were given a placebo for a year and then the groups were given the opposite treatment for a further year. Results The parallel trial found no difference in height scores after treatment with growth hormone compared to no additional treatment. No serious side effects were seen in either of the trials. In the cross‐over trial, human growth hormone therapy improved the height standard deviation score (z score), and temporarily increased blood phosphate levels.  We found no conclusive evidence that shows that human growth hormone treatment works for this condition. There have not been enough studies of human growth hormone treatment for this condition and more research is needed. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Quality of the evidence We mostly graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low. This was because the trials were very small and only included a few children. We were also concerned that there might have been some bias in the results because of the design of the smaller cross‐over trial.",CD004447
"Background Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus‐induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti‐IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti‐IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti‐IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 09 September 2021. We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 16 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing anti‐IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager. Main results Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double‐blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively. Authors' conclusions There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti‐IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function.","Use of anti‐IgE treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of anti‐IgE therapy for treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited disease which is not uncommon in the Western World. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by extreme sensitivity to aspergillus (a fungus) and may occur in 2% to 15% of people with cystic fibrosis. Corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are the mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but lengthy or repeated use of corticosteroids may lead to serious side effects. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs as a result of the action of IgE antibodies (a type of protein). A drug that acts against these IgE antibodies (anti‐IgE therapy), such as omalizumab, may be a possible treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. The drug is given as an injection below the skin every two to four weeks. The review aimed to show whether anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis is effective and to highlight any possible side effects. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We could only include one small study in the review (14 participants) and this was stopped early because not enough people agreed to join the study as volunteers. The study lasted six months and compared omalizumab (Xolair®) injections under the skin of the upper arm or the thigh to placebo injections (dummy treatment containing no active medication). Volunteers were given of 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo daily along with itraconazole (an antifungal drug) twice daily and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Key results The full results of the study were not published. Only limited results on side effects were published online. Six out of nine volunteers (66.67%) in the omalizumab group and one out of five volunteers (20%) in the placebo group reported one or more serious side effects. Due to the lack of evidence, we are not able to make recommendations either in favour of, or against the use of, anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. More research into this treatment is needed.",CD010288
"Background This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019. Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre‐ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. Search methods We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. Selection criteria We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs of blinded or open‐label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials were excluded). We included cross‐over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash‐out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non‐hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. Data collection and analysis We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure‐free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. Main results Following title, abstract, and full‐text screening, we included eight full‐text articles reporting on four double‐blind, placebo‐controlled RCTs. We included two cross‐over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non‐hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. Meta‐analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure‐free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I 2  = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I 2  = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. Authors' conclusions This review provides very low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses. Further clinical trials are needed in this area.","Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy Background Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. Objectives The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. Methods We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. Results We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. The evidence is current to July 2021. Certainty of the evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. Conclusions We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area.",CD013225
"Background Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices which produce an aerosol formed by heating an e‐liquid. Some people who smoke use ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organizations, advocacy groups and policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is an update conducted as part of a living systematic review. Objectives To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long‐term smoking abstinence. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 May 2021, and reference‐checked and contacted study authors. We screened abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) 2021 Annual Meeting.   Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross‐over trials, in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer or data on safety markers at one week or longer, or both. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow‐up, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels of carcinogens or toxicants or both. We used a fixed‐effect Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta‐analyses. Main results We included 61 completed studies, representing 16,759 participants, of which 34 were RCTs. Five of the 61 included studies were new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated seven (all contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 42 at high risk overall (including all non‐randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 1.93; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 1924 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 6). There was low‐certainty evidence (limited by very serious imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.19: I 2  = 0; 3 studies, 1183 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non‐nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 1447 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate‐certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.72; I 2  = 0; 6 studies, 1033 participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.74; I 2  = 0%; 6 studies, 2886 participants). In absolute terms this represents an additional six quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 15). However, this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some evidence that non‐serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I 2  = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 participants), and again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.24; I 2  = 0%; 7 studies, 1303 participants).  Data from non‐randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non‐nicotine ECs. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect  evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow‐up was two years and the  number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up‐to‐date information to decision‐makers, this review is now a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available.

What are electronic cigarettes? Electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) are handheld devices that work by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine and flavourings. E‐cigarettes allow you to inhale nicotine in a vapour rather than smoke. Because they do not burn tobacco, e‐cigarettes do not expose users to the same levels of chemicals that can cause diseases in people who smoke  conventional cigarettes. Using an e‐cigarette is commonly known as 'vaping'. Many people use e‐cigarettes to help them to stop smoking tobacco. In this review we focus primarily on nicotine e‐cigarettes. Why we did this Cochrane Review Stopping smoking lowers your risk of getting lung cancer, heart attacks and many other diseases. Many people find it difficult to stop smoking. We wanted to find out if using e‐cigarettes could help people to stop smoking, and if people using them for this purpose experience any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the use of e‐cigarettes to help people stop smoking. We looked for randomized controlled trials, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We also looked for studies in which everyone received an e‐cigarette treatment. We were interested in finding out: · how many people stopped smoking for at least six months; and · how many people had unwanted effects, reported on after at least one week of use. Search date:  We included evidence published up to 1st May 2021. What we found We found 61 studies in 16,759 adults who smoked. The studies compared e‐cigarettes with: · nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches or gum; · varenicline (a medicine to help people stop smoking); · nicotine‐free e‐cigarettes; · other types of nicotine‐containing e‐cigarettes (e.g. pod devices, newer devices); · behavioural support, such as advice or counselling; or · no support for stopping smoking. Most studies took place in the USA (26 studies), the UK (11), and Italy (7). What are the results of our review? More people probably stop smoking for at least six months using nicotine e‐cigarettes than using nicotine replacement therapy (4 studies, 1924 people), or nicotine‐free e‐cigarettes (5 studies, 1447 people). Nicotine e‐cigarettes may help more people to stop smoking than no support or behavioural support only (6 studies, 2886 people). For every 100 people using nicotine e‐cigarettes to stop smoking, 9 to 14 might successfully stop, compared with only 6 of 100 people using nicotine‐replacement therapy, 7 of 100 using nicotine‐free e‐cigarettes, or four of 100 people having no support or behavioural support only. We are uncertain if there is a difference between how many unwanted effects occur using nicotine e‐cigarettes compared with nicotine replacement therapy, no support or behavioural support only.  There was some evidence that non‐serious unwanted effects were more common in groups receiving nicotine e‐cigarettes compared to no support  or behavioural support only. Similar low numbers of unwanted effects, including serious unwanted effects, were reported for other comparisons. There is probably no difference in how many non‐serious unwanted effects occur in people using nicotine e‐cigarettes compared to non‐nicotine e‐cigarettes. The unwanted effects reported most often with nicotine e‐cigarettes were throat or mouth irritation, headache, cough and feeling sick. These effects reduced over time as people continued using nicotine e‐cigarettes. How reliable are these results? Our results are based on a small number of studies, and in some the  data varied widely. We are moderately confident that nicotine e‐cigarettes help more people to stop smoking than nicotine replacement therapy or nicotine‐free e‐cigarettes.  More studies are still needed to confirm this. Studies comparing nicotine e‐cigarettes with behavioural or no support also showed higher quit rates in people using nicotine e‐cigarettes, but provide less certain data because of issues with study design.  Most of our results for the unwanted effects may change when more evidence becomes available. Key messages Nicotine e‐cigarettes probably do help people to stop smoking for at least six months. They probably work better than nicotine replacement therapy and nicotine‐free e‐cigarettes. They may work better than no support, or behavioural support alone, and they may not be associated with serious unwanted effects. However, we need more evidence to be confident about the effects of e‐cigarettes, particularly the effects of newer types of e‐cigarettes that have better nicotine delivery than older types of e‐cigarettes.",CD010216
"Background This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first‐line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited. Objectives To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout. Search methods We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. Selection criteria We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low‐dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update. Main results We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three‐arm trial compared high‐dose colchicine (52 participants), low‐dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high‐dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti‐gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open‐label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low‐quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low‐dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low‐dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low‐dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low‐dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low‐quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high‐dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high‐dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high‐dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high‐dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low‐quality evidence from a single trial comparing high‐dose to low‐dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low‐quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low‐dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow‐up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high‐dose versus low‐dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low‐dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low‐quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision). Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence that low‐dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low‐quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high‐ and low‐dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low‐quality evidence suggests that high‐dose (but not low‐dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low‐quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low‐dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.","Colchicine for treating acute gout flares Background Gout is a very common cause of inflammatory arthritis (pain, redness, warmth and swelling of affected joints) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. Uric acid is a normal waste product that is usually excreted with urine. However, in the case of gout, there is either excessive production of uric acid, or the body is not able to excrete it quickly enough, or a combination of both. An attack of gout usually occurs rapidly and usually resolves within 7 to 10 days. Colchicine is a drug that is used mainly in gout to treat an acute attack or to prevent an attack while starting uric acid‐lowering therapy. Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to August 2020. We included four trials (803 randomised participants) in this updated review, including two new trials. One three‐arm trial compared high‐dose colchicine (52 participants), low‐dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (fake medicine) (59 participants); one trial compared high‐dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti‐gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We selected low‐dose colchicine compared with placebo as the primary comparison; the low dose is consistent with doses used in practice. Trials were performed in hospital and multicentre settings in four countries, the majority of participants were male, and mean age ranged between 51.2 and 70 years. One trial received funding from a pharmaceutical company that was involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript writing. Key results Compared with placebo medication, low‐dose colchicine for people with acute gout may slightly improve treatment outcomes with little or no increased risk of adverse events at 32 to 36 hours. Proportion of participants reporting treatment success (defined as 50% or more reduction in pain) 25% more people (7% more to 42% more) reported success, or 25 more out of 100 ‐ 42 people out of 100 reported treatment success with colchicine ‐ 17 people out of 100 reported treatment success with placebo Total adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) 6% more people reported adverse events (13% more to 23% more), or 6 more out of 100 ‐ 26 people out of 100 reported side effects with colchicine ‐ 20 people out of 100 reported side effects with placebo Pain, reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported for this comparison. Other comparisons are briefly summarised here: High‐dose colchicine may improve symptoms compared with placebo, but with more adverse events. High‐dose may have little or no benefit over low‐dose colchicine but more adverse events. There may also be little or no benefit of low‐dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction, with a similar number of adverse events. There were no trials that compared colchicine to glucocorticoids. Quality of the evidence We found low‐quality evidence that low‐dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low‐quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high‐ and low‐dose colchicine improve treatment success when compared to placebo, high‐dose (but not low‐dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo while the number of adverse events may be similar with low‐dose colchicine compared with NSAIDs. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.",CD006190
"Background Maternal complications, including psychological/mental health problems and neonatal morbidity, have commonly been observed in the postpartum period. Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the weeks following birth may prevent health problems from becoming chronic, with long‐term effects. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. Objectives The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of different home‐visiting schedules on maternal and newborn mortality during the early postpartum period. The review focuses on the frequency of home visits (how many home visits in total), the timing (when visits started, e.g. within 48 hours of the birth), duration (when visits ended), intensity (how many visits per week), and different types of home‐visiting interventions. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (19 May 2021), and checked reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐, quasi‐RCTs and studies available only as abstracts) comparing different home‐visiting interventions that enrolled participants in the early postpartum period (up to 42 days after birth) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies in which women were enrolled and received an intervention during the antenatal period (even if the intervention continued into the postnatal period), and studies recruiting only women from specific high‐risk groups (e.g. women with alcohol or drug problems). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. The trials were carried out in countries across the world, in both high‐ and low‐resource settings. In low‐resource settings, women receiving usual care may have received no additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. The interventions and controls varied considerably across studies. Trials focused on three broad types of comparisons, as detailed below. In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. The aim of all interventions was broadly to assess the well‐being of mothers and babies, and to provide education and support. However, some interventions had more specific aims, such as to encourage breastfeeding, or to provide practical support. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data, and results were inconsistent overall. All studies had several domains with high or unclear risk of bias. More versus fewer home visits (five studies, 2102 women) The evidence is very uncertain about whether home visits have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality (very low‐certainty evidence). Mean postnatal depression scores as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) may be slightly higher (worse) with more home visits, though the difference in scores was not clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79; two studies, 767 women; low‐certainty evidence). Two separate analyses indicated conflicting results for maternal satisfaction (both low‐certainty evidence); one indicated that there may be benefit with fewer visits, though the 95% CI just crossed the line of no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02; two studies, 862 women). However, in another study, the additional support provided by health visitors was associated with increased mean satisfaction scores (MD 14.70, 95% CI 8.43 to 20.97; one study, 280 women; low‐certainty evidence). Infant healthcare utilisation may be decreased with more home visits (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64; four studies, 1365 infants) and exclusive breastfeeding at six weeks may be increased (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36; three studies, 960 women; low‐certainty evidence). Serious neonatal morbidity up to six months was not reported in any trial. Different models of postnatal care (three studies, 4394 women) In a cluster‐RCT comparing usual care with individualised care by midwives, extended up to three months after the birth, there may be little or no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 infants). The proportion of women with EPDS scores ≥ 13 at four months is probably reduced with individualised care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; one study, 1295 women). One study suggests there may be little to no difference between home visits and telephone screening in neonatal morbidity up to 28 days (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 women). In a different study, there was no difference between breastfeeding promotion and routine visits in exclusive breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.69; one study, 656 women). Home versus facility‐based postnatal care (eight studies, 5179 women) The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in postnatal depression rates at 42 days postpartum and also as measured on an EPDS scale at 60 days. Maternal satisfaction with postnatal care may be better with home visits (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.62; three studies, 2368 women). There may be little to no difference in infant emergency health care visits or infant hospital readmissions (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; three studies, 3257 women) or in exclusive breastfeeding at two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 study, 513 women). Authors' conclusions The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of home visits on maternal and neonatal mortality. Individualised care as part of a package of home visits probably improves depression scores at four months and increasing the frequency of home visits may improve exclusive breastfeeding rates and infant healthcare utilisation. Maternal satisfaction may also be better with home visits compared to hospital check‐ups. Overall, the certainty of evidence was found to be low and findings were not consistent among studies and comparisons. Further well designed RCTs evaluating this complex intervention will be required to formulate the optimal package.","Home visits in the early period after the birth of a baby What is the issue? Health problems for mothers and babies commonly occur or become apparent in the weeks following the birth. For the mothers these include postpartum haemorrhage (substitute excessive blood loss), fever and infection, abdominal and back pain, abnormal discharge (heavy or smelly vaginal discharge), thromboembolism (a blood clot), and urinary tract complications (being unable to control the urge to pee), as well as psychological and mental health problems such as postnatal depression. Mothers may also need support to establish breastfeeding. Babies are at risk of death related to infections (babies may be badly affected by infections), asphyxia (difficulties in breathing, caused by lack of oxygen), and preterm birth (being born prematurely). Why is this important? Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the early postpartum period may prevent health problems from becoming long‐term, with effects on women, their babies, and their families. This review looked at different home‐visiting schedules in the weeks following the birth. What evidence did we find? We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. Some trials focused on physical checks of the mother and newborn, while others provided support for breastfeeding, and one included the provision of practical support with housework and childcare. They were carried out in both high‐resource countries and low‐resource settings where women receiving usual care may not have received additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. The trials focused on three broad types of comparisons: schedules involving more versus fewer postnatal home visits (five studies), schedules involving different models of care (three studies), and home versus facility postnatal check‐ups (eight studies). In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data. Overall, our results were inconsistent. The evidence was very uncertain about whether home visits reduced newborn deaths or serious health problems with the mother. Women's physical and psychological health were not improved with more intensive schedules of home visits although more individualised care improved women's mental health in one study and maternal satisfaction was slightly better in two studies. Overall, babies may be less likely to have additional medical care if their mothers received more postnatal home visits. More home visits may have encouraged more women to exclusively breastfeed their babies and women to be more satisfied with their postnatal care. The different outcomes reported in different studies, how the outcomes were measured, and the considerable variation in the interventions and control conditions across studies were limitations of this review. The certainty of the evidence was generally found to be low or very low according to the GRADE criteria. What does this mean? Increasing the number of postnatal home visits may promote infant health and exclusive breastfeeding and more individualised care may improve outcomes for women. More research is needed before any particular schedule of postnatal care can be recommended.",CD009326
"Background Most disabling strokes are due to a blockage of a large artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt removal of the clot with intra‐arterial thrombolytic drugs or mechanical devices, or both, can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred, leading to improved recovery. However, these so‐called endovascular interventions can cause bleeding in the brain. This is a review of randomised controlled trials of endovascular thrombectomy or intra‐arterial thrombolysis, or both, for acute ischaemic stroke. Objectives To assess whether endovascular thrombectomy or intra‐arterial interventions, or both, plus medical treatment are superior to medical treatment alone in people with acute ischaemic stroke. Search methods We searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and Cochrane Vascular Group (last searched 1 September 2020), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 1 September 2020), MEDLINE (May 2010 to 1 September 2020), and Embase (May 2010 to 1 September 2020). We also searched trials registers, screened reference lists, and contacted researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any endovascular intervention plus medical treatment compared with medical treatment alone in people with definite ischaemic stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (MBR and MJ) applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. Two review authors (MBR and HL) assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We obtained both published and unpublished data if available. Our primary outcome was favourable functional outcome at the end of the scheduled follow‐up period, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. Eighteen trials (i.e. all but one included trial) reported their outcome at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were death from all causes at in the acute phase and by the end of follow‐up, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the acute phase and by the end of follow‐up, neurological status at the end of follow‐up, and degree of recanalisation. Main results We included 19 studies with a total of 3793 participants. The majority of participants had large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation, and were treated within six hours of symptom onset with endovascular thrombectomy. Treatment increased the chance of achieving a good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2: risk ratio (RR) 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 1.63; 3715 participants, 18 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence). Treatment also reduced the risk of death at end of follow‐up: RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 3793 participants, 19 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence) without increasing the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the acute phase: RR 1.46 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.36; 1559 participants, 6 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence) or by end of follow‐up: RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 1752 participants, 10 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence); however, the wide confidence intervals preclude any firm conclusion. Neurological recovery to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0 to 1 and degree of recanalisation rates were better in the treatment group: RR 2.03 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.40; 334 participants, 3 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence) and RR 8.25 (95% CI 1.63 to 41.90; 198 participants, 2 RCTs; moderate‐certainty evidence), respectively. Authors' conclusions In individuals with acute ischaemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation, endovascular thrombectomy can increase the chance of survival with a good functional outcome without increasing the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage or death.","Endovascular thrombectomy and intra‐arterial interventions for acute ischaemic stroke Review question This review addressed whether endovascular thrombectomy (removal of a blood clot in a blood vessel using a mechanical device) or intra‐arterial thrombolysis (injecting clot‐dissolving drugs directly into the clot), or both, provide better outcomes than standard treatment alone in stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel. Background The majority of disabling strokes are due to a blockage of a large blood vessel by a blood clot in the brain. Such strokes lead to brain tissue damage because of oxygen deprivation. An ischaemic stroke is a stroke where the restriction of blood flow causes damage and death to the surrounding tissue due to oxygen shortage. For these patients, the most intuitive means of treatment is removal of the blockage by either injecting clot‐dissolving drugs directly into the clot or removal of the blood clot using a mechanical device, or both. Prompt treatment can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred, leading to a good recovery. However, these treatments can also cause bleeding in the brain, which can result in poorer outcomes. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) of both endovascular mechanical thrombectomy and intra‐arterial thrombolysis to establish whether they are safe and effective treatments for stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel. Search date 1 September 2020 Study characteristics Randomised controlled trials of endovascular thrombectomy or intra‐arterial thrombolysis, or both, plus routine medical treatment compared with routine medical treatment alone in people with a definite acute ischaemic stroke. Study funding sources No funding sources. Key results We found 19 trials involving a total of 3793 participants. Treatment with endovascular thrombectomy can improve patients' chance of survival with the ability to function well without increasing the risk of bleeding in the brain or death. It is still unclear what the optimal time window is within which treatment is beneficial and whether treatment is effective in the posterior (supplying the rear part of the brain) circulation. There is also a need to study whether a strategy of primary endovascular thrombectomy or intra‐arterial thrombolysis, or both, is superior to a strategy where intravenous (injected into the vein) clot‐dissolving treatment is provided first in a local centre followed by transfer of selected patients to hospitals able to perform mechanical thrombectomy or intra‐arterial thrombolysis, or both. Certainty of the evidence We judged the available trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and so overall the evidence is reported to be of high certainty.",CD007574
"Background There is growing interest in paying for performance (P4P) as a means to align the incentives of healthcare providers with public health goals. Rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) is lacking; this is an update of the 2012 review on this topic. Objectives To assess the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and 10 other databases between April and June 2018. We also searched two trial registries, websites, online resources of international agencies, organizations and universities, and contacted experts in the field. Studies identified from rerunning searches in 2020 are under 'Studies awaiting classification.' Selection criteria We included randomized or non‐randomized trials, controlled before‐after studies, or interrupted time series studies conducted in LMICs (as defined by the World Bank in 2018). P4P refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target. To be included, a study had to report at least one of the following outcomes: patient health outcomes, changes in targeted measures of provider performance (such as the delivery of healthcare services), unintended effects, or changes in resource use. Data collection and analysis We extracted data as per original review protocol and narratively synthesised findings. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Given diversity and variability in intervention types, patient populations, analyses and outcome reporting, we deemed meta‐analysis inappropriate. We noted the range of effects associated with P4P against each outcome of interest. Based on intervention descriptions provided in documents, we classified design schemes and explored variation in effect by scheme design. Main results We included 59 studies: controlled before‐after studies (19), non‐randomized (16) or cluster randomized trials (14);  and interrupted time‐series studies (9). One study included both an interrupted time series and a controlled before‐after study. Studies focused on a wide range of P4P interventions, including target payments and payment for outputs as modified by quality (or quality and equity assessments). Only one study assessed results‐based aid. Many schemes were funded by national governments (23 studies) with the World Bank funding most externally funded schemes (11 studies). Targeted services varied; however, most interventions focused on reproductive, maternal and child health indicators. Participants were predominantly located in public or in a mix of public, non‐governmental and faith‐based facilities (54 studies). P4P was assessed predominantly at health facility level, though districts and other levels were also involved. Most studies assessed the effects of P4P against a status quo control (49 studies); however, some studies assessed effects against comparator interventions (predominantly enhanced financing intended to match P4P funds (17 studies)). Four studies reported intervention effects against both comparator and status quo. Controlled before‐after studies were at higher risk of bias than other study designs. However, some randomised trials were also downgraded due to risk of bias. The interrupted time‐series studies provided insufficient information on other concurrent changes in the study context. P4P compared to a status quo control For health services that are  specifically   targeted , P4P may slightly improve health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may also improve service quality overall (low certainty evidence); and probably increases the availability of health workers, medicines and well‐functioning infrastructure and equipment (moderate certainty evidence). P4P may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of services (low certainty evidence) and may have few or no distorting unintended effects on outcomes that were not targeted (low‐certainty evidence), but few studies assessed these. For secondary outcomes, P4P may make little or no difference to provider absenteeism, motivation or satisfaction (low certainty evidence); but may improve patient satisfaction and acceptability (low certainty evidence); and may positively affect facility managerial autonomy (low certainty evidence). P4P probably makes little to no difference to management quality or facility governance (low certainty evidence). Impacts on equity were mixed (low certainty evidence). For health services that are  untargeted , P4P probably improves some health outcomes (moderate certainty evidence); may improve the delivery, use and quality of some health services but may make little or no difference to others (low certainty evidence); and may have few or no distorting unintended effects (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on the availability of medicines and other resources are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). P4P compared to other strategies For health outcomes and services that are  specifically   targeted , P4P may make little or no difference to health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may improve service quality (low certainty evidence); and may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of health services and on the availability of equipment and medicines (low certainty evidence). For health outcomes and services that are  untargeted , P4P may make little or no difference to health outcomes and to the delivery and use of health services (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on service quality, resource availability and unintended effects are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Findings of subgroup analyses Results‐based aid, and schemes using payment per output adjusted for service quality, appeared to yield the greatest positive effects on outcomes. However, only one study evaluated results‐based aid, so the effects may be spurious. Overall, schemes adjusting both for quality of service and rewarding equitable delivery of services appeared to perform best in relation to service utilization outcomes. Authors' conclusions The evidence base on the impacts of P4P schemes has grown considerably, with study quality gradually increasing. P4P schemes may have mixed effects on outcomes of interest, and there is high heterogeneity in the types of schemes implemented and evaluations conducted. P4P is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches. Its effects depend on the interaction of several variables, including the design of the intervention (e.g., who receives payments ), the amount of additional funding,  ancillary components (such as technical support) and contextual factors (including organizational context).","Paying for performance to improve the delivery of healthcare services in low‐ and middle‐income countries The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of ‘pay for performance’ on the delivery of healthcare services in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 59 studies. Key messages The studies included in this review looked at pay for performance approaches that varied in their design, setting and implementation. The review shows that pay for performance may have both positive and negative effects on the health services it targets. It may also have positive effects on other health services that are not directly targeted and may have no unintended negative effects on these services. However, most of this evidence is of low certainty and we need more, well‐conducted studies on this topic. What is ‘pay for performance’? In a 'pay for performance' approach, people are given money or other rewards if they carry out a particular task or meet a particular target. Pay for performance is usually directed at health workers or healthcare facilities. The health workers or healthcare facilities are rewarded if they offer particular services or deliver care that is of a certain quality, or if their patients use particular services and achieve better health as a result. Pay for performance can be used  to target specific health problems and services that need improvement. But pay for performance could also affect other services that are not specifically targeted. For instance, it could lead health workers to improve the quality of the other services they deliver. But it could also lead them to avoid services that don’t lead to extra payment. To find out more, the review authors assessed the effects of paying for performance on both targeted and untargeted services. This included looking for any unintended effects. What are the main results of the review? The review included 59 relevant studies. Most were from sub‐Saharan Africa and Asia. Most of the pay for performance schemes in the studies were funded by national Ministries of Health, also with support of the World Bank. Forty‐nine studies compared health facilities that used pay for performance with health facilities that were doing business as usual. Seventeen studies compared health facilities that used pay for performance with facilities that used other approaches. In most of these studies,  these approaches involved giving similar amount of funds but without insisting on a pay for performance element. The effects of paying for performance compared to business as usual    For health services that are  specifically   targeted , pay for performance: ‐ may improve some health outcomes, may improve service quality and probably increase the availability of health workers, medicines and well‐functioning infrastructure and equipment; but ‐ may have both positive and negative effects on the delivery and use of health services. For health services that are  untargeted , pay for performance: ‐ probably improves some health outcomes; ‐ may improve the delivery, use and quality of some health services but may make little or no difference to others; and ‐ may have few or no unintended effects.

"Background Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an age‐specific epilepsy syndrome characterised by multiple seizure types, including drop seizures. LGS has a characteristic electroencephalogram, an onset before age eight years and an association with drug resistance. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review published in 2013. Objectives To assess the efficacy and tolerability of anti‐seizure medications (ASMs) for LGS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 28 February 2020) on 2 March 2020. CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Cochrane Epilepsy; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and colleagues in the field to seek any unpublished or ongoing studies. Selection criteria We considered RCTs, including cross‐over trials, of ASMs for LGS in children and adults. We included studies of ASMs used as either monotherapy or as an add‐on (adjunctive) therapy. We excluded studies comparing different doses of the same ASM. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including independent, dual assessment for risk of bias and application of the GRADE approach to rate the evidence certainty for outcomes. Main results We found no trials of ASM monotherapy. The review included 11 trials (1277 participants; approximately 11 weeks to 112 weeks follow‐up after randomisation) using add‐on ASMs for LGS in children, adolescents and adults. Two studies compared add‐on cannabidiol (two doses) with add‐on placebo in children and adolescents only. Neither study reported overall seizure cessation or reduction. We found high‐certainty evidence that 72 more people per 1000 (confidence interval (CI) 4 more to 351 more) had adverse events (AE) leading to study discontinuation with add‐on cannabidiol, compared to add‐on placebo (two studies; 396 participants; risk ratio (RR) 4.90, 95% CI 1.21 to 19.87). One study compared add‐on cinromide with add‐on placebo in children and adolescents only. We found very low‐certainty evidence that 35 more people per 1000 (CI 123 fewer to 434 more) had 50% or greater average reduction of overall seizures with add‐on cinromide compared to add‐on placebo (one study; 56 participants; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.86). This study did not report participants with AE leading to study discontinuation. One study compared add‐on clobazam (three doses) with add‐on placebo. This study did not report overall seizure cessation or reduction. We found high‐certainty evidence that 106 more people per 1000 (CI 0 more to 538 more) had AE leading to study discontinuation with add‐on clobazam compared to add‐on placebo (one study; 238 participants; RR 4.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 16.87). One study compared add‐on felbamate with add‐on placebo. No cases of seizure cessation occurred in either regimen during the treatment phase (one study; 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence that 53 more people per 1000 (CI 19 fewer to 716 more) with add‐on felbamate were seizure‐free during an EEG recording at the end of the treatment phase, compared to add‐on placebo (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.32 to 26.77). The study did not report overall seizure reduction. We found low‐certainty evidence that one fewer person per 1000 (CI 26 fewer to 388 more) with add‐on felbamate had AE leading to study discontinuation compared to add‐on placebo (one study, 73 participants; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.97). Two studies compared add‐on lamotrigine with add‐on placebo. Neither study reported overall seizure cessation. We found high‐certainty evidence that 176 more people per 1000 (CI 30 more to 434 more) had ≥ 50% average seizure reduction with add‐on lamotrigine compared to add‐on placebo (one study; 167 participants; RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.76). We found low‐certainty evidence that 40 fewer people per 1000 (CI 68 fewer to 64 more) had AE leading to study‐discontinuation with add‐on lamotrigine compared to add‐on placebo (one study; 169 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.82). Two studies compared add‐on rufinamide with add‐on placebo. Neither study reported seizure cessation. We found high‐certainty evidence that 202 more people per 1000 (CI 34 to 567 more) had ≥ 50% average seizure reduction (one study; 138 participants; RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31 to 6.18). We found low‐certainty evidence that 105 more people per 1000 (CI 17 fewer to 967 more) had AE leading to study discontinuation with add‐on rufinamide compared to add‐on placebo (one study; 59 participants; RR 4.14, 95% CI 0.49 to 34.86). One study compared add‐on rufinamide with another add‐on ASM. This study did not report overall seizure cessation or reduction. We found low‐certainty evidence that three fewer people per 1000 (CI 75 fewer to 715 more) had AE leading to study discontinuation with add‐on rufinamide compared to another add‐on ASM (one study; 37 participants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.57). One study compared add‐on topiramate with add‐on placebo. This study did not report overall seizure cessation. We found low‐certainty evidence for ≥ 75% average seizure reduction with add‐on topiramate (one study; 98 participants; Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 8.22, 99% CI 0.60 to 112.62) and little or no difference to AE leading to study discontinuation compared to add‐on placebo; no participants experienced AE leading to study discontinuation (one study; 98 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions RCTs of monotherapy and head‐to‐head comparison of add‐on ASMs are currently lacking. However, we found high‐certainty evidence for overall seizure reduction with add‐on lamotrigine and rufinamide, with low‐certainty evidence for AE leading to study discontinuation compared with add‐on placebo or another add‐on ASM. The evidence for other add‐on ASMs for overall seizure cessation or reduction was low to very low with high‐ to low‐certainty evidence for AE leading to study discontinuation. Future research should consider outcome reporting of overall seizure reduction (applying automated seizure detection devices), impact on development, cognition and behaviour; future research should also investigate age‐specific efficacy of ASMs and target underlying aetiologies.","Are anti‐seizure medications effective and safe treatments for Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome? Why is this question important? Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of epilepsy that mainly affects children. The main symptom in LGS is frequent and multiple types of seizures. Seizures are caused by sudden and uncontrolled surges of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The seizures are difficult to treat with anti‐seizure medications (ASMs). Many different ASMs are given to try and stop the seizures. Two or three ASMs are often given at the same time, which is known as polypharmacy. It is unclear which medications are most effective. Most people with LGS also have learning and behavioural difficulties. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysing the effects of anti‐seizure medications (ASMs) for treating LGS. We included any RCT that compared ASMs, whether as monotherapy or add‐on (adjunctive) therapy, with placebo (pretend treatment), no treatment or another kind of treatment. We then compared the results of the RCTs we found, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the 'certainty' of evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. Study characteristics This review included 11 trials (1277 participants, including children, adolescents and adults). The trials lasted between about 11 weeks and 112 weeks after randomisation. None of the included trials compared one ASM on its own with another treatment. Two trials compared add‐on cannabidiol regimens (cannabis‐based medicine) with add‐on placebo regimens (396 children and adolescents only). One trial compared an add‐on cinromide regimen with an add‐on placebo regimen (56 children and adolescents only). One trial compared an add‐on clobazam regimen with an add‐on placebo regimen (238 participants). One trial compared an add‐on felbamate regimen with an add‐on placebo regimen (73 participants). Two trials compared add‐on lamotrigine regimens with add‐on placebo regimens (186 participants). Two trials compared add‐on rufinamide regimens with add‐on placebo regimens (197 participants). One trial compared an add‐on rufinamide regimen with another ASM regimen (37 participants). One trial compared an add‐on topiramate regimen with an add‐on placebo regimen (98 participants). Most of the evidence in this review related to people from middle‐ or high‐income countries and, where reported, participants of white ethnicity. Results and certainty of the evidence We found high‐certainty evidence that add‐on lamotrigine increased the number of participants with at least 50% reduction in the average number of reported seizures. We also found low‐certainty evidence that add‐on lamotrigine may have reduced the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation when compared to add‐on placebo. We found high‐certainty evidence that add‐on rufinamide increased the number of participants with at least 50% reduction in the average number of reported seizures, when compared with add‐on placebo. We also found low‐certainty evidence that add‐on rufinamide may have little or no difference in effect, compared to add‐on placebo or another unspecified ASM, on reduction of the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Add‐on topiramate may have increased the number of participants with at least 75% reduction in the average number of reported seizures, and probably made little or no difference to the number of adverse events leading to study discontinuation, when compared to add‐on placebo (low‐certainty evidence). Add‐on felbamate (treatment phase) may have made little or no difference in terms of reported seizure freedom and adverse events leading to study discontinuation when compared to add‐on placebo (low‐certainty evidence). However, we found that when seizures were recorded in a research setting, add‐on felbamate may have increased seizure freedom compared to add‐on placebo (low‐certainty evidence). We remain uncertain whether other add‐on drug therapies, including cannabidiol, cinromide and clobazam, reduced all types of seizures because this outcome was not reported or had very low‐certainty evidence. We found high‐certainty evidence that add‐on cannabidiol and add‐on clobazam increased the number of participants with adverse events leading to study discontinuation, when compared to add‐on placebo. We did not find any evidence for adverse events leading to study discontinuation in the comparison of add‐on cinromide with add‐on placebo. The evidence is current to March 2020.",CD003277
"Background In patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality remains high. These patients require mechanical ventilation, which has been associated with ventilator‐induced lung injury. High levels of positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) could reduce this condition and improve patient survival. This is an updated version of the review first published in 2013. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of high versus low levels of PEEP in adults with ALI and ARDS. Search methods For our previous review, we searched databases from inception until 2013. For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Web of Science from inception until May 2020. We also searched for ongoing trials ( www.trialscentral.org ;  www.clinicaltrial.gov ;  www.controlled-trials.com ), and we screened the reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared high versus low levels of PEEP in ALI and ARDS participants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated in intensive care for at least 24 hours. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. We contacted investigators to identify additional published and unpublished studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included four new studies (1343 participants) in this review update. In total, we included 10 studies (3851 participants). We found evidence of risk of bias in six studies, and the remaining studies fulfilled all criteria for low risk of bias. In eight studies (3703 participants), a comparison was made between high and low levels of PEEP, with the same tidal volume in both groups. In the remaining two studies (148 participants), the tidal volume was different between high‐ and low‐level groups. In the main analysis, we assessed mortality occurring before hospital discharge only in studies that compared high versus low PEEP, with the same tidal volume in both groups. Evidence suggests that high PEEP may result in little to no difference in mortality compared to low PEEP (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.04; I² = 15%; 7 studies, 3640 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In addition, high PEEP may result in little to no difference in barotrauma (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.57; I² = 63%; 9 studies, 3791 participants; low‐certainty evidence). High PEEP may improve oxygenation in patients up to the first and third days of mechanical ventilation (first day: mean difference (MD) 51.03, 95% CI 35.86 to 66.20; I² = 85%; 6 studies, 2594 participants; low‐certainty evidence; third day: MD 50.32, 95% CI 34.92 to 65.72; I² = 83%; 6 studies, 2309 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and probably improves oxygenation up to the seventh day (MD 28.52, 95% CI 20.82 to 36.21; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1611 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence suggests that high PEEP results in little to no difference in the number of ventilator‐free days (MD 0.45, 95% CI ‐2.02 to 2.92; I² = 81%; 3 studies, 1654 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Available data were insufficient to pool the evidence for length of stay in the intensive care unit. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that high levels compared to low levels of PEEP do not reduce mortality before hospital discharge. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that high levels of PEEP result in little to no difference in the risk of barotrauma. Low‐certainty evidence also suggests that high levels of PEEP improve oxygenation up to the first and third days of mechanical ventilation, and moderate‐certainty evidence indicates that high levels of PEEP improve oxygenation up to the seventh day of mechanical ventilation. As in our previous review, we found clinical heterogeneity ‐ mainly within participant characteristics and methods of titrating PEEP ‐ that does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of high levels of PEEP in patients with ALI and ARDS. Further studies should aim to determine the appropriate method of using high levels of PEEP and the advantages and disadvantages associated with high levels of PEEP in different ARDS and ALI patient populations.","Effects of higher versus lower levels of pressure in the lungs at the end of each breath during mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Review question We wanted to find evidence from randomised controlled trials on the benefits and harms of high versus low levels of lung positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP). We wanted to focus on adult patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These patients have low oxygen levels in the blood and therefore reduced tissue oxygenation. PEEP is pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) at the end of each breath (expiration). In mechanically ventilated patients, PEEP works against passive emptying of the lung and collapse of air sacs (alveoli). Collapse of air sacs can lead to incomplete inflation of the lung on the next breath and reduced oxygenation. PEEP is used to improve oxygenation. Background ALI and ARDS are caused by leakage of fluid in the lung and local inflammation that can cause widespread alveolar damage and a build‐up of fluid in the lungs. The build‐up of fluid can be seen on chest X‐rays. Alveolar damage can lead to later scarring (fibrosis). Common causes are pneumonia infection and more general (systemic) infection, as with sepsis. ALI and ARDS patients are placed on mechanical ventilation (delivery of positive pressure to the lungs, usually via a breathing tube). Mechanical ventilation is a method of artificial support for respiration that introduces gas into the patient's airway through an external mechanical system. Use of PEEP is one of the lung protection strategies aimed at improving oxygenation of patients and survival. The benefits and risks of PEEP are unclear, as it could increase the risk of lung damage called barotrauma. This occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall (pneumothorax). This air pushes on the outside of the lung and causes it to collapse. Study characteristics Evidence is current to May 2020. This review has no funding sources. We included 10 studies with 3851 participants (6 from the previous review and 4 from our updated search of the literature). In eight studies (3703 participants), a comparison was made between high and low levels of PEEP, with the same amount of air delivered to the lungs and breathed out (exhaled) with each breath (tidal volume) in each group. The other two studies used different tidal volumes for the two groups and could not be included in all of the review results. Key results We noted the following findings. • Higher levels of PEEP (compared to lower levels) may make little to no difference in the number of patients who die before hospital discharge (7 studies, 3642 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). • Blood oxygenation was improved with higher PEEP on the first, third (6 studies, over 2300 participants, both low‐certainty evidence), and seventh days (5 studies, 1611 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) of studies. • Higher levels of PEEP were not associated with barotrauma (9 studies, 3790 participants; low‐certainty evidence). • High PEEP levels did not increase the number of ventilator‐free days over a 28‐day time period (3 studies, 1654 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Finally, available data were insufficient to evaluate the impact of PEEP on length of stay in the intensive care unit, which is required with mechanical ventilation. Certainty of the evidence The highest level of certainty of evidence was moderate, and some outcomes were supported by low‐certainty evidence. Patients in the different studies varied in severity of ALI or ARDS and in other clinical factors (causing heterogeneity). Different approaches were used to set and adjust PEEP levels.",CD009098
"Background The most frequent indications for tooth extractions, generally performed by general dental practitioners, are dental caries and periodontal infections. Systemic antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2012. Objectives To determine the effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevention of infectious complications following tooth extractions. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 16 April 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 April 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 April 2020), and LILACS (1982 to 16 April 2020). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov )  and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We included randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included studies. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random‐effects models. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random‐effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for key outcomes as high, moderate, low, or very low, using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 23 trials that randomised approximately 3206 participants (2583 analysed) to prophylactic antibiotics or placebo. Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, only one of the trials evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in groups of patients affected by those clinical conditions. We assessed 16 trials as being at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and four as unclear.  Compared to placebo, antibiotics may reduce the risk of postsurgical infectious complications in patients undergoing third molar extractions by approximately 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1728 participants; 12 studies; low‐certainty evidence), which means that 19 people (95% CI 15 to 34) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. Antibiotics may also reduce the risk of dry socket by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; 1882 participants; 13 studies; low‐certainty evidence), which means that 46 people (95% CI 29 to 62) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. The evidence for our other outcomes is uncertain: pain, whether measured dichotomously as presence or absence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.12; 675 participants; 3 studies) or continuously using a visual analogue scale (0‐to‐10‐centimetre scale, where 0 is no pain) (MD −0.26, 95% CI −0.59 to 0.07; 422 participants; 4 studies); fever (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.79; 475 participants; 4 studies); and adverse effects, which were mild and transient (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.64; 1277 participants; 8 studies) (very low‐certainty evidence).  We found no clear evidence that the timing of antibiotic administration (preoperative, postoperative, or both) was important. The included studies enrolled a subset of patients undergoing dental extractions, that is healthy people who had surgical extraction of third molars. Consequently, the results of this review may not be generalisable to all people undergoing tooth extractions. Authors' conclusions The vast majority (21 out of 23) of the trials included in this review included only healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. None of the studies evaluated tooth extraction in immunocompromised patients. We found low‐certainty evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket following third molar extraction when compared to placebo, and very low‐certainty evidence of no increase in the risk of adverse effects. On average, treating 19 healthy patients with prophylactic antibiotics may stop one person from getting an infection. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to patients with concomitant illnesses or patients at a higher risk of infection. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic treatment, clinicians should evaluate if and when to prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy before a dental extraction for each patient on the basis of the patient's clinical conditions (healthy or affected by systemic pathology) and level of risk from infective complications. Immunocompromised patients, in particular, need an individualised approach in consultation with their treating medical specialist.","Are antibiotics an effective way to prevent infection following tooth removal? What is the problem? Teeth that are affected by decay or gum disease or painful wisdom teeth are often removed (extracted) by dentists. Tooth extraction is a surgical procedure that leaves a wound in the mouth that can become infected. Infection can lead to swelling, pain, development of pus, fever, as well as ‘dry socket’ (where the tooth socket is not filled by a blood clot, and there is severe pain and bad odour). These complications are unpleasant for patients and may cause difficulty with chewing, speaking, and teeth cleaning, and may even result in days off work or study. Treatment of infection is generally simple and involves drainage of the infection from the wound and patients receiving antibiotics. Why is this question important? Antibiotics work by killing the bacteria that cause infections, or by slowing their growth. However, some infections clear up by themselves. Taking antibiotics unnecessarily may stop them working effectively in future. This ‘antimicrobial resistance’ is a growing problem throughout the world. Antibiotics may also cause unwanted effects such as diarrhoea and nausea. Some patients may be allergic to antibiotics, and antibiotics may not mix well with other medicines. Dentists frequently give patients antibiotics at the time of the extraction as a precaution in order to prevent infection occurring in the first place. This may be unnecessary and may lead to unwanted effects. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether giving antibiotics as a preventive measure reduces infection and other complications after tooth extraction. We also wanted to understand whether antibiotics work differently in healthy people compared with people with health conditions such as diabetes or HIV. What did we do? We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of antibiotics compared to placebo (sham medicine), given when no infection was present in order to prevent infection following tooth extraction. Studies could include people of any age undergoing tooth extraction. Where possible, we pooled the studies’ results and analysed them together. We also assessed the quality of each study to judge the reliability (certainty) of evidence of individual studies and the body of evidence. What we found We found 23 included studies with a total of more than 3200 participants, who received either antibiotics (of different kinds and dosages) or placebo immediately before or just after tooth extraction, or both. Four studies were conducted in Spain, three each in Brazil, Sweden, and the UK, two in India, and one each in Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Poland, New Zealand, Nigeria, and the USA. All but one study included healthy patients in their 20s. Twenty‐one studies assessed the removal of wisdom teeth in hospital dental departments, one assessed the removal of other teeth and one assessed complex oral surgery. None of the included studies assessed tooth extraction in general dental practice for the removal of decayed teeth. Main results Antibiotics given just before or just after surgery (or both) may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket after the removal of wisdom teeth by oral surgeons. However, antibiotics may cause more (generally brief and minor) unwanted effects for these patients. We found no evidence that antibiotics prevent pain, fever, swelling, or problems with restricted mouth opening in patients who have had wisdom teeth removed. There was no evidence to judge the effects of preventive antibiotics for extractions of severely decayed teeth, teeth in diseased gums, or extractions in patients who are sick or have low immunity to infection. How reliable are the results? Our confidence in the results is limited because we had concerns about aspects of the design and reporting of all of the included studies. What does this mean? We did not find studies in patients with depressed immune systems, other illnesses, or in young children or older patients, therefore the results of our review probably do not apply to people who may be at high risk of infection. Also, extractions were mainly carried out by oral surgeons, so the review may not apply to dentists working in general practice. Another concern, which cannot be assessed by clinical studies (i.e. studies testing new medical approaches in people), is that widespread use of antibiotics by people who do not have an infection is likely to contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. We concluded that antibiotics given to healthy people when they are having teeth extracted may help prevent infection, but the decision to use an antibiotic should be judged on an individual patient basis based on their state of health and possible complications of getting an infection. How up‐to‐date is this review? This is an updated review. The evidence is current to April 2020.",CD003811
"Background This is the third update of this review, first published in July 2009. All major guidelines on treatment of hypertension recommend weight loss; anti‐obesity drugs may be able to help in this respect. Objectives Primary objectives: To assess the long‐term effects of pharmacologically‐induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non‐serious adverse events).. Secondary objectives: To assess the long‐term effects of pharmacologically‐induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and on body weight reduction. Search methods For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to March 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The searches had no language restrictions. We contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration in adults with hypertension that compared approved long‐term weight‐loss medications to placebo.  Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis. When heterogeneity was present, we used the random‐effects method and investigated the cause of the heterogeneity. Main results This third update of the review added one new trial, investigating the combination of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo. Two medications, which were included in the previous versions of this review (rimonabant and sibutramine) are no longer considered relevant for this update, since their marketing approval was withdrawn in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The number of included studies in this review update is therefore six (12,724 participants in total): four RCTs comparing orlistat to placebo, involving a total of 3132 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 46 to 55 years; one trial comparing phentermine/topiramate to placebo, involving 1305 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 53 years; and one trial comparing naltrexone/bupropion to placebo, involving 8283 participants with hypertension and a mean age of 62 years. We judged the risks of bias to be unclear for the trials investigating orlistat or naltrexone/bupropion. and low for the trial investigating phentermine/topiramate. Only the study of naltrexone/bupropion included cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as predefined outcomes. There were no differences in the rates of all‐cause or cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo. The incidence of overall adverse events was significantly higher in participants treated with naltrexone/bupropion. For orlistat, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher compared to placebo. The most frequent side effects with phentermine/topiramate were dry mouth and paraesthesia. After six to 12 months, orlistat reduced systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by mean difference (MD) −2.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) −3.8 to −1.4 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants) and diastolic blood pressure by MD −2.0 mm Hg (95% CI −2.7 to −1.2 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants). After 13 months of follow‐up, phentermine/topiramate decreased systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by −2.0 to −4.2 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage), and diastolic blood pressure by −1.3 to −1.9 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage). There was no difference in the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo (1 trial, 8283 participants). We identified no relevant studies investigating liraglutide or lorcaserin in people with hypertension. Authors' conclusions In people with elevated blood pressure, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion reduced body weight; the magnitude of the effect was greatest with phentermine/topiramate. In the same trials, orlistat and phentermine/topiramate, but not naltrexone/bupropion, reduced blood pressure. One RCT of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo showed no differences in all‐cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity after two years. The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for phentermine/topiramate due to safety concerns, while for lorcaserin the application for European marketing authorisation was withdrawn due to a negative overall benefit/risk balance. In 2020 lorcaserin was also withdrawn from the US market. Two other medications (rimonabant and sibutramine) had already been withdrawn from the market in 2009 and 2010, respectively.","Do medicines for weight loss affect blood pressure, and reduce the effects of high blood pressure (hypertension)? What is high blood pressure (hypertension)? Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body. It is usually given as two figures: the pressure when your heart pushes blood out (systolic pressure), and the pressure when your heart rests between beats (diastolic pressure). Blood pressure is considered to be high when systolic pressure is over 140 and/or diastolic pressure is over 90, often written as '140 over 90' and measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). The risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older. Hypertension can increase people's risk of developing serious long‐term health problems, such as heart attack or stroke. Lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension reduces the number of people who develop diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), which leads to fewer deaths and cardiovascular problems.     Weight and hypertension Hypertension treatment guidelines recommend keeping to a healthy weight and losing weight when needed. Some people may take medicines to help reduce their weight.         Why we did this Cochrane Review  Medicines licensed for use in weight loss in the USA and Europe include orlistat and naltrexone combined with bupropion. Another combination, phentermine with topiramate, is licensed in the USA only. We wanted to find out if weight‐loss medicines have long‐lasting effects on blood pressure, and whether they could reduce the unwanted effects of high blood pressure on people's health.   What did we do? We searched for studies about the effects of taking weight‐loss medicines in people with high blood pressure. We were interested in how these medicines affected blood pressure and body weight.  We also wanted to know how many people experienced any unwanted effects, how many people developed cardiovascular disease, and if any people died.   We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment.  We assessed the reliability of the evidence we found. We considered factors such as: how the studies were conducted, how many people they involved, and whether their findings were consistent across studies.  Search date:  we included evidence published up to March 2020.  What we found We found six studies in 12,724 people with high blood pressure (average age 46 to 62 years). The studies were conducted in the USA (3 studies) and Europe (3 studies), and lasted from 6 months to 28 months.  All studies compared the effects of taking a weight‐loss medicine with effects of taking a dummy medicine (placebo).   What are the results of our review? Orlistat may reduce weight and probably reduces blood pressure (4 studies; 2058 people). Phentermine plus topiramate may reduce weight and may reduce blood pressure (1 study; 1305 people). Naltrexone plus bupropion probably reduces weight but probably does not reduce blood pressure (1 study; 8283 people). One study looked at the risk of death and major unwanted cardiovascular effects; it showed no differences between naltrexone plus bupropion treatment and a placebo after two years.  People taking weight‐loss medicines reported more unwanted effects than those taking a placebo. The most common unwanted effects were digestive problems (for orlistat, and phentermine plus topiramate), dry mouth and skin tingling or numbness (for naltrexone plus bupropion).  How reliable are these results?  Results are from a small number of studies. In some studies, there were few events for some measures we were interested in.    We are moderately confident about how orlistat and naltrexone plus bupropion affected weight loss and blood pressure. However, results might change if more evidence becomes available.  We are less confident about the effects of phentermine plus topiramate; the unwanted effects of orlistat, and the risk of unwanted cardiovascular events associated with naltrexone plus bupropion. Results are likely to change if more evidence becomes available.  Conclusions Some weight‐loss medicines reduce weight and blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, but may cause unwanted effects. We did not find enough evidence about whether taking weight‐loss medicines to lose weight could reduce death and cardiovascular disease.",CD007654
"Background The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl ®  cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. Authors' conclusions Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Leg ulcers are a chronic complication for people living with sickle cell disease. Ulcers tend to be difficult to treat successfully, healing slowly over months or years. They can severely disrupt quality of life, increase disability, require extended absence from the workplace, and place a high burden of care on healthcare systems. We looked at whether treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease were effective and safe. Search date The evidence is current to: 13 January 2020. Study characteristics In this updated Cochrane Review we have included six randomised controlled trials including 198 participants with 250 ulcers. Four of the randomised controlled trials were conducted in Jamaica and two in the USA. These trials included medications or dressings applied directly to the ulcer (topical medications) and medications given orally or intravenously (systemic medications). Given the very different modes of action of these two groups, we treated them separately throughout the review. The topical agents included Solcoseryl® cream, RGD peptide matrix dressing and topical antibiotics. Socoseryl aims to improve the use of oxygen by the skin tissue and so promote wound healing. Topical antibiotics are also used to prevent infection. The RGD peptide matrix is a gel that promotes cell growth. The systemic interventions included arginine butyrate, L‐cartinine, and isoxsuprine. Aginine butyrate, given intravenously, is thought to accelerate wound healing, L‐carnitine, given orally, is thought to improve tissue hypoxia, and isoxsuprine, given orally as isoxsuprine hydrochloride, is thought to widen blood vessels, so increasing blood flow to an affected wound. Key results Given the very low quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure. None of the included trials reported on our other outcomes of interest: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation; or harms. Quality of the evidence There is very limited evidence available on the use of interventions to treat people with sickle cell disease and chronic leg ulceration. All randomised clinical trials that we included in this review were associated with an unclear or high risk of bias, providing very low‐quality evidence. This systematic review has shown the need for well‐designed, high‐quality randomised trials to assess the benefits and harms of interventions to improve the healing of leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.",CD008394
"Background Prior to introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs),  Streptococcus pneumoniae  was most commonly isolated from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media (AOM). Reducing nasopharyngeal colonisation of this bacterium by PCVs may lead to a decline in AOM. The effects of PCVs deserve ongoing monitoring since studies from the post‐PCV era report a shift in causative otopathogens towards non‐vaccine serotypes and other bacteria. This updated Cochrane Review was first published in 2002 and updated in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. Objectives To assess the effect of PCVs in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and two trials registers, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, to 11 June 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of PCV versus placebo or control vaccine. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were frequency of all‐cause AOM and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included frequency of pneumococcal AOM and frequency of recurrent AOM (defined as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 15 publications of 11 trials (60,733 children, range 74 to 37,868 per trial) of 7‐ to 11‐valent PCVs versus control vaccines (meningococcus type C vaccine in three trials, and hepatitis A or B vaccine in eight trials). We included one additional publication of a previously included trial for this 2020 update. We did not find any relevant trials with the newer 13‐valent PCV. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Overall, risk of bias was low. In seven trials (59,415 children), PCVs were administered in early infancy, whilst four trials (1318 children) included children aged one year and over who were either healthy or had a history of respiratory illness. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity across studies, therefore we reported results from individual studies. PCV administered in early infancy PCV7 The licenced 7‐valent PCV with CRM197 as carrier protein (CRM197‐PCV7) was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval (CI) −4% to 16%; 1 trial; 1662 children) and 6% (95% CI 4% to 9%; 1 trial; 37,868 children) relative risk reduction (RRR) in low‐risk infants (moderate‐certainty evidence), but was not associated with a reduction in all‐cause AOM in high‐risk infants (RRR −5%, 95% CI −25% to 12%). PCV7 with the outer membrane protein complex of  Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup B as carrier protein (OMPC‐PCV7) was not associated with a reduction in all‐cause AOM (RRR −1%, 95% CI −12% to 10%; 1 trial; 1666 children; low‐certainty evidence). CRM197‐PCV7 and OMPC‐PCV7 were associated with 20% (95% CI 7% to 31%) and 25% (95% CI 11% to 37%) RRR in pneumococcal AOM, respectively (2 trials; 3328 children; high‐certainty evidence), and CRM197‐PCV7 with 9% (95% CI −12% to 27%) and 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%) RRR in recurrent AOM (2 trials; 39,530 children; moderate‐certainty evidence). PHiD‐CV10/11 The effect of a licenced 10‐valent PCV conjugated to protein D, a surface lipoprotein of  Haemophilus influenzae , (PHiD‐CV10) on all‐cause AOM in healthy infants varied from 6% (95% CI −6% to 17%; 1 trial; 5095 children) to 15% (95% CI −1% to 28%; 1 trial; 7359 children) RRR (low‐certainty evidence). PHiD‐CV11 was associated with 34% (95% CI 21% to 44%) RRR in all‐cause AOM (1 trial; 4968 children; moderate‐certainty evidence). PHiD‐CV10 and PHiD‐CV11 were associated with 53% (95% CI 16% to 74%) and 52% (95% CI 37% to 63%) RRR in pneumococcal AOM (2 trials; 12,327 children; high‐certainty evidence ),  and PHiD‐CV11 with 56% (95% CI −2% to 80%) RRR in recurrent AOM (1 trial; 4968 children; low‐certainty evidence). PCV administered at a later age PCV7 We found no evidence of a beneficial effect on all‐cause AOM of administering CRM197‐PCV7 in children aged 1 to 7 years with a history of respiratory illness or frequent AOM (2 trials; 457 children; moderate‐certainty evidence) and CRM197‐PCV7 combined with a trivalent influenza vaccine in children aged 18 to 72 months with a history of respiratory tract infections (1 trial; 597 children; moderate‐certainty evidence). CRM197‐PCV9 In 1 trial including 264 healthy daycare attendees aged 1 to 3 years, CRM197‐PCV9 was associated with 17% (95% CI −2% to 33%) RRR in parent‐reported all‐cause otitis media (very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events Nine trials reported on adverse effects (77,389 children; high‐certainty evidence). Mild local reactions and fever were common in both groups, and occurred more frequently in PCV than in control vaccine groups: redness (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 20% versus 0% to 16%; swelling (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 12% versus 0% to 8%; and fever (< 39 °C): 15% to 44% versus 8% to 25%. More severe redness (> 2.5 cm), swelling (> 2.5 cm), and fever (> 39 °C) occurred less frequently (0% to 0.9%, 0.1% to 1.3%, and 0.4% to 2.5%, respectively) in children receiving PCV, and did not differ significantly between PCV and control vaccine groups. Pain or tenderness, or both, was reported more frequently in PCV than in control vaccine groups: 3% to 38% versus 0% to 8%. Serious adverse events judged to be causally related to vaccination were rare and did not differ significantly between groups, and no fatal serious adverse event judged causally related to vaccination was reported. Authors' conclusions Administration of the licenced CRM197‐PCV7 and PHiD‐CV10 during early infancy is associated with large relative risk reductions in pneumococcal AOM. However, the effects of these vaccines on all‐cause AOM is far more uncertain based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a beneficial effect on all‐cause AOM of administering PCVs in high‐risk infants, after early infancy, and in older children with a history of respiratory illness. Compared to control vaccines, PCVs were associated with an increase in mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain and/or tenderness. There was no evidence of a difference in more severe local reactions, fever, or serious adverse events judged to be causally related to vaccination.","Pneumococcal vaccination for preventing acute middle ear infections in children Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effect of vaccination against  Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus, a type of bacterium) for preventing acute middle ear infections in children. Background Before nationwide implementation of vaccination against  S pneumoniae  with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), pneumococcus was the most frequent cause of acute middle ear infections in children. Vaccination against this bacterium with PCVs may therefore lead to fewer acute middle ear infections in children. However, ongoing monitoring of the effects of PCVs on acute middle ear infections is warranted, since recent studies report a shift in bacteria causing acute middle ear infections towards pneumococcal types not included in the vaccines and other bacteria. Study characteristics The evidence is current up to 11 June 2020. We included 11 trials of PCVs versus control vaccines (meningococcus type C conjugate vaccine in three trials, and hepatitis A or B vaccine in eight trials) involving a total of 60,733 children. The PCVs used in the trials contained 7 to 11 different types of pneumococcus. None of the trials used the newer PCV containing 13 different types. Most trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Overall, risk of bias was low. In seven trials (59,415 children), children received PCVs in early infancy, whilst four trials included 1318 children aged one year and over who were either healthy or who had previous respiratory illness. Key results When a licenced vaccine containing seven different types of pneumococcus (CRM197‐PCV7) was given during early infancy, the risk of experiencing acute middle ear infections increased by 5% in high‐risk infants and decreased by 6% in low‐risk infants. When administrating a licenced vaccine containing 10 types of pneumococcus together with a carrier protein from another bacterium called  Haemophilus influenzae  (PHiD‐CV10), the risk of experiencing acute middle ear infections decreased by 6% to 15%, however neither of these estimates reached significance. Giving PCV7 after early infancy (children aged one year and above) and in older children with a history of respiratory illness or frequent acute middle ear infections was not associated with reductions in acute middle ear infections. Mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain/tenderness were common and occurred more frequently in children receiving PCV than in those receiving control vaccines. More severe local reactions (redness and swelling > 2.5 cm) and fever (> 39 °C) occurred far less frequently and did not differ between vaccine groups. Serious adverse events judged to have been related to vaccination were rare and did not differ significantly between vaccine groups. Certainty of the evidence We assessed the certainty of the evidence for CRM197‐PCV7 in early infancy to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate). We judged the certainty of the evidence for PHiD‐CV10 to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate). We judged the certainty of the evidence for PCV7 in older children with or without a history of respiratory illness to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate).",CD001480
"Background Tubal disease accounts for 20% of infertility cases. Hydrosalpinx, caused by distal tubal occlusion leading to fluid accumulation in the tube(s), is a particularly severe form of tubal disease negatively affecting the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART). It is thought that tubal surgery may improve the outcome of ART in women with hydrosalpinges. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of tubal surgery in women with hydrosalpinges prior to undergoing conventional in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, DARE, and two trial registers on 8 January 2020, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical treatment versus no surgical treatment, or comparing surgical interventions head‐to‐head, in women with tubal disease prior to undergoing IVF. Data collection and analysis We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were live birth rate (LBR) and surgical complication rate per woman randomised. Secondary outcomes included clinical, multiple and ectopic pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates and mean numbers of oocytes retrieved and of embryos obtained. Main results We included 11 parallel‐design RCTs, involving a total of 1386 participants. The included trials compared different types of tubal surgery (salpingectomy, tubal occlusion or transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid) to no tubal surgery, or individual interventions to one another. We assessed no studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains, with the main limitations being lack of blinding, wide confidence intervals and low event and sample sizes. We used GRADE methodology to rate the quality of the evidence. Apart from one moderate‐quality result in one review comparison, the evidence provided by these 11 trials ranged between very low‐ to low‐quality. Salpingectomy versus no tubal surgery No included study reported on LBR for this comparison. We are uncertain of the effect of salpingectomy on surgical complications such as the rate of conversion to laparotomy (Peto odds ratio (OR) 5.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 303.69; one RCT; n = 204; very low‐quality evidence) and pelvic infection (Peto OR 5.80, 95% CI 0.11 to 303.69; one RCT; n = 204; very low‐quality evidence). Salpingectomy probably increases clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) versus no surgery (risk ratio (RR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.82; four RCTs; n = 455; I 2  = 42.5%; moderate‐quality evidence). This suggests that in women with a CPR of approximately 19% without tubal surgery, the rate with salpingectomy lies between 27% and 52%. Proximal tubal occlusion versus no surgery No study reported on LBR and surgical complication rate for this comparison. Tubal occlusion may increase CPR compared to no tubal surgery (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.72 to 5.99; two RCTs; n = 209; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). This suggests that with a CPR of approximately 12% without tubal surgery, the rate with tubal occlusion lies between 21% and 74%. Transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid versus no surgery No study reported on LBR for this comparison, and there was insufficient evidence to identify a difference in surgical complication rate between groups (Peto OR not estimable; one RCT; n = 176). We are uncertain whether transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid increases CPR compared to no tubal surgery (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.55; three RCTs; n = 311; I 2  = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Laparoscopic proximal tubal occlusion versus laparoscopic salpingectomy We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic proximal tubal occlusion versus laparoscopic salpingectomy on LBR (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95; one RCT; n = 165; very low‐quality evidence) and CPR (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; three RCTs; n = 347; I 2  = 77%; very low‐quality evidence). No study reported on surgical complication rate for this comparison. Transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid versus laparoscopic salpingectomy No study reported on LBR for this comparison, and there was insufficient evidence to identify a difference in surgical complication rate between groups (Peto OR not estimable; one RCT; n = 160). We are uncertain of the effect of transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid versus laparoscopic salpingectomy on CPR (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.07; one RCT; n = 160; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that salpingectomy prior to ART probably increases the CPR compared to no surgery in women with hydrosalpinges. When comparing tubal occlusion to no intervention, we found that tubal occlusion may increase CPR, although the evidence was of low quality. We found insufficient evidence of any effect on procedure‐ or pregnancy‐related adverse events when comparing tubal surgery to no intervention. Importantly, none of the studies reported on long term fertility outcomes. Further high‐quality trials are required to definitely determine the impact of tubal surgery on IVF and pregnancy outcomes of women with hydrosalpinges, particularly for LBR and surgical complications; and to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of the different surgical modalities in the treatment of hydrosalpinges prior to ART.","Surgical treatment for tubal disease in women due to undergo in vitro fertilisation Review question We reviewed the efficacy and safety of performing surgery on women with known disease of the fallopian tube, particularly hydrosalpinx (a condition in which fluid accumulates in one or both fallopian tubes, leading to poor reproductive success), before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare all types of surgery on the fallopian tube with no surgery prior to IVF. These types of surgery include salpingectomy, where one or both fallopian tubes are removed; tubal occlusion, where the fallopian tubes are blocked using metal clips or divided with scissors and electrocautery so that the fluid from existing hydrosalpinges does not reach the cavity of the womb; and ultrasound‐guided aspiration of the hydrosalpingeal fluid through the vagina. Where evidence was available, we also aimed to compare any type of fallopian tube surgery to any other type of fallopian tube surgery. Background Up to one in five women who suffer with infertility are diagnosed with blockage of one or both fallopian tubes. IVF treatment is used for women with tubal disease, as the eggs and sperm are manipulated outside the body. The resulting embryos are transferred back into the cavity of the womb, without the need for open fallopian tubes. However, research has shown that in cases of tubal blockage, women may develop a condition termed hydrosalpinx, where fluid accumulates inside the tubes and may prevent the successful implantation of embryos created by IVF. Tubal surgery has therefore been suggested to treat hydrosalpinges, as it may prevent the hydrosalpingeal fluid from reaching the cavity of the womb. If this fluid reaches the womb cavity, it may negatively affect the success of assisted conception. Study characteristics We found 11 randomised controlled trials comparing surgery on the fallopian tube to no tubal surgery in a total of 1386 women with hydrosalpinges prior to IVF. The evidence is current to January 2020. Key results No studies reported on live birth rates in the main comparison of tubal surgery versus no tubal surgery. Compared to no surgery in the fallopian tube, salpingectomy probably increases the chance of clinical pregnancy. The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy is assumed to be 19% with no salpingectomy, the chance of clinical pregnancy following salpingectomy would be between 27% and 52%. There was a lack of sufficient data to identify an effect of the different types of tubal surgery on adverse events such as surgical complications, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Quality of the evidence Apart from one moderate‐quality result in one review comparison, the evidence provided by these 11 trials ranged from very low‐ to low‐quality. The main limitations in this body of research were the lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences in results across studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study) .",CD002125
"Background Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pentoxifylline, one of many drugs used to treat IC, acts by decreasing blood viscosity, improving erythrocyte flexibility, and promoting microcirculatory flow and tissue oxygen concentration. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of pentoxifylline in treating people with PAD, but results of these studies are variable. This is the second update of a review first published in 2012. Objectives To determine the efficacy of pentoxifylline in improving the walking capacity (i.e. pain‐free walking distance and total (absolute, maximum) walking distance) of people with stable intermittent claudication, Fontaine stage II. Search methods For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 January 2020. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included all double‐blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pentoxifylline versus placebo or any other pharmacological intervention in people with IC Fontaine stage II. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed the included studies, matched data and resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and collected results related to the outcomes of interest, pain‐free walking distance (PFWD), total walking distance (TWD), ankle‐brachial pressure index (ABI), quality of life (QoL) and side effects. Comparison of studies was based on duration and dose of pentoxifylline. We used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We identified no new eligible studies for this update. This review includes 24 studies with 3377 participants. Seventeen studies compared pentoxifylline versus placebo. The seven remaining studies compared pentoxifylline with flunarizine (one study), aspirin (one study), Gingko biloba extract (one study), nylidrin hydrochloride (one study), prostaglandin E1 (two studies), and buflomedil and nifedipine (one study). Risk of bias for the individual studies was generally unclear because there was a lack of methodological reporting for many of the included studies, especially regarding randomisation and allocation methods. Most included studies did not provide adequate information to allow selective reporting to be judged and did not report blinding of assessors. Heterogeneity between included studies was considerable with regards to multiple variables, including duration of treatment, dose of pentoxifylline, baseline walking distance and participant characteristics; therefore, pooled analysis for comparisons which included more than one study, was not possible. Pentoxifylline compared to placebo Of 17 studies comparing pentoxifylline with placebo, 11 reported PFWD and 14 reported TWD; the difference in percentage improvement in PFWD for pentoxifylline over placebo ranged from –33.8% to 73.9% and in TWD ranged from 1.2% to 155.9%. It was not possible to pool the data of the studies because data were insufficient and findings from individual trials were unclear. Most included studies suggested a possible improvement in PFWD and TWD for pentoxifylline over placebo (both low‐certainty evidence). The five studies which evaluated pre‐exercise ABI comparing pentoxifylline and placebo found no evidence of a difference (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of the three studies that evaluated QoL between people who received pentoxifylline and placebo were larger studies that used validated QoL tools and generally found no evidence of a difference between groups. One small, short‐term study, which did not specify which QoL tool was used, reported improved QoL in the pentoxifylline group (moderate‐certainty evidence). Pentoxifylline generally was well tolerated; the most commonly reported side effects consisted of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea (low‐certainty evidence). Certainty of the evidence from this review was low or moderate, with downgrading due to risk of bias concerns, inconsistencies between studies and the inability to evaluate imprecision because meta‐analysis could not be undertaken. The seven remaining studies compared pentoxifylline with either flunarizine, aspirin, Gingko biloba extract, nylidrin hydrochloride, prostaglandin E1, or buflomedil and nifedipine; data were too limited to allow any meaningful conclusions to be made. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of high‐certainty evidence for the effects of pentoxifylline compared to placebo, or other treatments, for IC. There is low‐certainty evidence that pentoxifylline may improve PFWD and TWD compared to placebo, but no evidence of a benefit to ABI or QoL (moderate‐certainty evidence). Pentoxifylline was reported to be generally well tolerated (low‐certainty evidence). Given the large degree of heterogeneity between the studies, the role of pentoxifylline for people with IC Fontaine class II remains uncertain.","How well does pentoxifylline treat intermittent claudication? What is intermittent claudication? Intermittent claudication is cramping pain in your lower leg that happens when you walk and usually goes away after a few minutes of rest. Both legs may be affected at the same time, although the pain may be worse in one leg. It happens because there is not enough blood flowing to the leg muscles. It is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease: a common condition in which fatty deposits build‐up on the walls of arteries (blood vessels) and restrict the flow of blood through them. How is intermittent claudication treated? Intermittent claudication is usually treated with exercise and medicines that reduce the chance of blood clots in a blocked blood vessel, or that reduce symptoms and help people to walk further. People with serious claudication may need to have surgery. Why we did this Cochrane Review Pentoxifylline is a medicine taken orally (by mouth) that makes the blood less thick and sticky. This helps blood to flow more easily through small vessels such as arteries, and lets more oxygen reach the muscles. Pentoxifylline is licensed for treating intermittent claudication, although more evidence of its benefits is needed before its use is recommended in treatment guidelines. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the use of pentoxifylline to treat intermittent claudication. We wanted to find out if pentoxifylline: – could help people to walk further, by measuring how far they could walk before feeling pain in their legs; – affected the relationship of blood pressure at the ankle compared with that in the arm (ankle‐brachial pressure index (ABI) – a measure of peripheral arterial disease); – affected people's quality of life (well‐being); and – caused any side effects. We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. Search date We included evidence published up to 28 January 2020. What we found We found 24 studies in 3377 people with intermittent claudication, conducted mostly in Europe and the USA. Seventeen studies compared pentoxifylline treatment with a dummy treatment (placebo); seven studies compared pentoxifylline with another medicine. The studies lasted from four weeks to 40 weeks. Differences in how the studies were conducted and how they measured the results meant that we could not combine all their results. We assessed results from the 17 studies comparing pentoxifylline with placebo, but we could not compare pentoxifylline with any of the other medicines. What are the results of our review? Compared with a placebo, most studies showed that pentoxifylline treatment may help people to walk further without pain: 11 studies in 1890 people measured how far they could walk without pain; 14 studies in 2110 people measured how far they could walk. For measurements of ABI, there were no clear differences between pentoxifylline and placebo treatment (5 studies, 902 people). Three studies in 1179 people assessed well‐being related to being able to walk. Two large studies showed no clear difference between pentoxifylline and placebo treatment, and one smaller study showed pentoxifylline probably improved people's well‐being, though it was unclear how that was measured. Side effects reported in the studies varied greatly: some studies reported no major side effects and most reported no side effects with pentoxifylline or with placebo (9 studies; 1837 people). How reliable are these results? We are not confident in the results for whether pentoxifylline helps people to walk further, or about its side effects, because we found limitations in the ways that the studies were designed and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are moderately confident that pentoxifylline treatment was similar to placebo in its effects on difference in ankle‐brachial pressure index, and on people's well‐being. These results might change when more evidence is available. Key messages Pentoxifylline may help people with intermittent claudication to walk further without pain, but we are uncertain about whether it works better than a placebo or other medicines. We did not find enough reliable evidence about any side effects.",CD005262
"Background Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both), and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence of APS is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events. Objectives To assess the effects of antiplatelet (AP) or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with APS. Search methods We last searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, and ongoing trials registers on 22 November 2019. We checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. We also contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or AP agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS, according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS. Data collection and analysis Pairs of review authors independently worked on each step of the review, following Cochrane methods. We summarized the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified eight studies including 811 participants that compared different AP or anticoagulant agents. NOAC (non‐VKA oral anticoagulant: rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg/d) versus standard‐dose VKA (vitamin K antagonist: warfarin at moderate International Normalized Ratio [INR] ‐ 2.5) or adjusted [INR 2.0‐3.0] dose): In three studies there were no differences in any thromboembolic event (including death) and major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence), but an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio [RR] 14.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87 to 106.8; moderate‐certainty evidence). One of the studies reported a small benefit of rivaroxaban in terms of quality of life at 180 days measured as health state on Visual Analogue Scale (mean difference [MD] 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low‐certainty evidence), but not measured as health utility on a scale from 0 to 1 (MD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.10; low‐certainty evidence). High‐dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 3.1 to 4.0 [mean 3.3] or 3.5 [mean 3.2]) versus standard‐dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [mean 2.3] or 2.5 [mean 2.5]): In two studies there were no differences in the rates of thrombotic events and major bleeding (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23, low‐certainty evidence), but an increased risk of minor bleeding in one study during a mean of 3.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.2) of follow‐up (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07). In both trials there was evidence of a higher risk of any bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low‐certainty evidence) in the high‐dose VKA group, and for this outcome (any bleeding) the incidence is not different, only the time to event is showing an effect. Standard‐dose VKA plus a single AP agent (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 plus aspirin 100 mg/d) versus standard‐dose VKA (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0): One high‐risk‐of‐bias study showed an increased risk of any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.43; low‐certainty evidence) and reported on major bleeding with five cases in the combined treatment group and one case in the standard‐dose VKA treatment group, resulting in RR 7.42 (95% CI 0.91 to 60.7; low‐certainty evidence) and no differences for secondary outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Single/dual AP agent and standard‐dose VKA (pooled results): Two high‐risk‐of‐bias studies compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin or unspecified VKA at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.0 to 2.5) with a single AP agent (aspirin 100 mg/d), but did not provide any conclusive evidence regarding the effects of those drugs in people with APS (very low‐certainty evidence). One of the above‐mentioned studies was a three‐armed study that compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5) with dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) and dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) versus a single AP treatment (aspirin 100 mg/d). This study reported on stroke (very low‐certainty evidence) but did not report on any thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or any secondary outcomes. We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification. Authors' conclusions The evidence identified indicates that NOACs compared with standard‐dose VKAs may increase the risk of stroke and do not appear to alter the risk of other outcomes (moderate‐certainty evidence). Using high‐dose VKA versus standard‐dose VKA did not alter the risk of any thromboembolic event or major bleeding but may increase the risk of any form of bleeding (low‐certainty evidence). Standard‐dose VKA combined with an AP agent compared with standard‐dose VKA alone may increase the risk of any thromboembolic event and does not appear to alter the risk of major bleeding or other outcomes (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the benefit or harm of using standard‐dose VKA plus AP agents versus single or dual AP therapy, or dual versus single AP therapy, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in people with APS (very low‐certainty evidence).","Anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet drugs, or both, for reducing the risk of blood clots and stroke in people with antiphospholipid syndrome Review question This review aimed to find out which type of treatment works best for preventing stroke and other blood clotting (thrombotic) events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Background APS is a disease where the immune system produces antibodies against the person's own cells. The presence of such antibodies increases the risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) in blood vessels (veins or arteries, or both) and can cause pregnancy‐related complications such as miscarriage. Blood clots in arteries can cause strokes. Two types of drugs are commonly used to prevent blood clots in people with APS: anticoagulants such as warfarin (which interfere with proteins that form blood clots) and antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin (which prevent cells called platelets from sticking together). Study characteristics The evidence is current to 22 November 2019. We looked for studies that randomly allocated people with APS to different treatments, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, or both. We identified eight studies involving 811 participants, with the average age between 36 and 50 years. Three studies compared rivaroxaban (a new oral anticoagulant) with standard‐dose warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist – VKA). Two studies compared two intensities of VKA anticoagulation: high versus standard. One study compared standard‐dose VKA plus aspirin versus standard‐dose VKA alone. The remaining studies compared different combinations of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin). One study compared dual antiplatelet drugs versus single antiplatelet drugs. Interventions lasted from 180 days to a median of 58.4 months. Key results In three studies comparing rivaroxaban (NOAC) with standard‐dose VKA there were similar proportions of participants with blood clots, bleeding, or death (moderate‐certainty evidence), but there were more participants with stroke in the NOAC group than in the VKA group (moderate‐certainty evidence). In the two studies comparing high‐dose versus a standard‐dose VKA, similar proportions of participants had blood clotting and major bleeding problems (low‐certainty evidence), but participants in the high‐dose group had a greater risk of minor and any bleeding problems (low‐certainty evidence). A study comparing standard VKA plus an antiplatelet drug with standard‐dose VKA observed more participants with any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (low‐certainty evidence) and similar proportions of participants for other outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). The remaining studies comparing different combinations of antiplatelet drug and/or VKA were inconclusive regarding benefits or harms (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification. Certainty of the evidence Most of the results were imprecise and did not clearly indicate benefit or harm.",CD012169
"Background Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has several treatment options, including angioplasty, stenting, exercise therapy, and bypass surgery. Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. Main results We included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. Six studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six‐month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); 12‐month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. There was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low‐certainty evidence), six‐month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low‐certainty evidence) or 12‐month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low‐certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low‐certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug‐eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. One study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low‐certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, respectively). Authors' conclusions This review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient‐centred outcomes are required.","Atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease Background Peripheral arterial disease is a narrowing or blockage of the arteries in the legs. People with this condition can experience pain on walking, pain at rest, or leg ulceration due to poor blood supply. Treatment options are: surgery, using a blood vessel or graft to bypass the narrowed or blocked section of the artery; balloon angioplasty, when a deflated balloon is passed into the narrowing at the end of a wire, then blown up to stretch the artery; and stenting (used in addition to balloon angioplasty), which holds open the balloon‐stretched section for extra support. A final option, less commonly used, is a technique called atherectomy. This treatment cuts or grinds away the fatty deposition (atheroma) within the artery that is causing the narrowing or occlusion. Key results In this review, we compared atherectomy with the other treatment options described above. We also looked within the two groups to assess whether using drug‐releasing balloons or stents impacted on participants' outcomes. We identified seven studies with a total of 527 participants. Six trials compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty (372 participants, 427 treated lesions). We found no clear difference between the procedures when examining artery patency at six and 12 months, risk of death, initial procedure failure rates, need to re‐treat the artery, risk of forming clots (embolisation), complication rates or risk of amputation. We found that atherectomy was associated with lower rates of emergency stenting during the procedure and lower balloon inflation pressures when compared with balloon angioplasty alone. We found no difference in results depending on whether the balloons were drug‐releasing or not. One study compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty and primary stenting (155 participants and 155 treated lesions). This study did not report primary patency. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in risk of death, complication rates, cardiovascular events and the need to re‐treat the artery. This study found no initial procedure failure events, We did not find any studies that compared bypass surgery against atherectomy. Certainty of the evidence Overall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. Conclusions In conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.",CD006680
"Background Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin disorder, affects people from sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 March 2020; ISRCTN: 19 April 2020; AMED: 18 May 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov: 24 April 2020; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials with participants of all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Three trials (212 participants) of three phytomedicines: Niprisan ®  (also known as Nicosan ® ), Ciklavit ®  and a powdered extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan ®  may be effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six‐month period (low‐quality evidence). It did not appear to affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low‐quality evidence). The single trial of  Cajanus cajan  (Ciklavit ® ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises, and a possible adverse effect (non‐significant) on the level of anaemia (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of  Pfaffia paniculata  on the laboratory parameters and symptoms of SCD (very low‐quality of evidence). No adverse effects were reported with Niprisan ®  and  Pfaffia paniculata  (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions While Niprisan ®  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six‐month follow‐up period, further trials are required to assess its role in managing people with SCD and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit ®  and the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  in managing SCD. Based on the published results for Niprisan ®  and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of the three trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in SCD. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials with improved study design and data collection are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing SCD.","Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood condition caused by defects in the production of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen across the body. Sickle cell disease occurs when people inherit faulty genes responsible for producing haemoglobin from both parents. A variety of complications and a reduced life expectancy are linked with sickle cell disease. Phytomedicines are medicines derived from plants in their original state. People with sickle cell disease may come across them in terms of plant‐remedies from traditional healers. Their benefits have not been evaluated systematically. Laboratory work has long suggested that these medicines may help to ease the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 18 May 2020 . Study characteristics Three trials (212 participants) and three phytomedicines Niprisan ®  (also known as Nicosan ® ), Ciklavit ®  and the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  were included. Key results This review found that Niprisan ®  may help to reduce episodes of sickle cell disease crises associated with severe pain. Ciklavit ®  may have little or no effect in reducing painful crises in SCD, and a possible adverse effect on the level of anaemia. We are uncertain of the effect of the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia Paniculata  in SCD. The three phytomedicine formulations reported no serious adverse symptoms or derangement of liver or kidney function in the participants. More scientifically robust trials of these medicines will need to be carried out before we can make any recommendations about their use. Further research should also assess long‐term outcome measures. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence from this review to be of low to very low quality, depending on the outcome measured.",CD004448
"Background Preterm infants are born with low glycogen stores and require higher glucose intake to match fetal accretion rates. In spite of the myriad benefits of breast milk for preterm infants, it may not adequately meet the needs of these rapidly growing infants. Supplementing human milk with carbohydrates may help. However, there is a paucity of data on assessment of benefits or harms of carbohydrate supplementation of human milk to promote growth in preterm infants. This is a 2020 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999. Objectives To determine whether human milk supplemented with carbohydrate compared with unsupplemented human milk fed to preterm infants improves growth, body composition, and cardio‐metabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes without significant adverse effects. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE via PubMed on 22 August 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria Published and unpublished controlled trials were eligible if they used random or quasi‐random methods to allocate preterm infants in hospital fed human milk to supplementation or no supplementation with additional carbohydrate. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality and the quality of evidence at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. We planned to perform meta‐analyses using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We planned to use a fixed‐effect model and to explore potential causes of heterogeneity via sensitivity analyses. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results One unblinded, quasi‐randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing effects of carbohydrate supplementation of human milk in the form of a prebiotic in 75 preterm infants was eligible for inclusion in this review. We identified two publications of the same trial, which reported different methods regarding blinding and randomisation. Study authors confirmed that these publications pertain to the same trial, but they have not yet clarified which method is correct. Our analyses showed very low certainty evidence of an effect of carbohydrate supplementation on weight by 30 days of age age (MD 160.4 grams, 95% CI 12.4 to 308.4 grams), and no effect on risk of feeding intolerance (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.3). Duration of hospital stay was shorter in the prebiotic group than in the control group (median difference 9 days). No data were available for assessing effects of carbohydrate supplementation on long‐term growth and neurodevelopment. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether carbohydrate supplementation of human milk affects any outcomes in preterm infants. The only trial included in this review presented very low‐quality evidence, and study authors provided uncertain information about study methods and analysis. The evidence may be limited in its applicability because researchers included a small sample of preterm infants from a single centre. Future trials could assess the safety and efficacy of different types and concentrations of carbohydrate supplementation for preterm infants fed human milk. However, we do not envisage that further trials of digestible carbohydrates will be conducted, as this is currently done as a component of multi‐nutrient human milk fortification.","Carbohydrate supplementation of human milk to promote growth in preterm infants Review question Does addition of extra carbohydrate to human milk fed to preterm infants compared with no additional carbohydrate improve growth, body fat, obesity, heart problems, high blood sugar, and brain development without causing significant side effects? Background Not enough carbohydrate intake in preterm infants may result in poor growth and development. Breast milk is the best food for preterm infants, but feeding them only breast milk may be nutritionally inadequate. Adding carbohydrate to breast milk may help. However, not enough data can be found on assessing the benefits and harms of adding carbohydrate to breast milk to promote growth in preterm infants. Study characteristics We found one trial involving 75 preterm infants with very low‐quality evidence on the effects of adding extra prebiotics (a type of carbohydrate) to human milk in preterm infants. A second publication by the same study authors reported different methods regarding blinding and randomisation of the trial. Study authors confirmed that these publications describe the same trial but have not yet clarified which method is accurate. We were unable to reproduce the analyses from the data presented. The search is up to date as of August 2019. Key results Prebiotic carbohydrate supplementation increased the mean weight of preterm infants at day 30 and resulted in a shorter hospital stay compared with control. No evidence shows a clear difference in risk of feeding intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis between the prebiotic‐supplemented and unsupplemented groups. No other data were available to show the effects of adding extra carbohydrate to human milk on short‐ and long‐term growth, body fat, obesity, brain development, and heart problems. Conclusions Evidence on the short‐ and long‐term effects of adding extra carbohydrate to human milk in preterm infants is lacking. This systematic review found very low‐quality evidence on the effects of adding prebiotic carbohydrate to human milk in preterm infants, along with uncertainties about methods and analysis. The single trial included a small sample of Iranian preterm infants, and so the evidence may be considered as not generalisable. However, the outcomes assessed are common to all preterm infants, and the trial shows that adding prebiotic carbohydrate to human milk is possible in developing countries. Further research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of different types and concentrations of carbohydrate supplementation for preterm infants fed human milk. Currently, digestible carbohydrate supplementation in preterm infants is provided as a component of multi‐nutrient human milk fortification.",CD000280
"Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 7). To increase the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), adherence compounds such as hyaluronic acid (HA) have been introduced into subfertility management. Adherence compounds are added to the embryo transfer medium to increase the likelihood of embryo implantation, with the potential for higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Objectives To determine whether adding adherence compounds to embryo transfer media could improve pregnancy outcomes, including improving live birth and decreasing miscarriage, in women undergoing assisted reproduction. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO electronic databases on 7 January 2020 for randomised controlled trials that examined the effects of adherence compounds in embryo transfer media on pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we communicated with experts in the field, searched trials registries, checked reference lists of relevant studies, and conference abstracts were handsearched. Selection criteria Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo transfer media containing functional concentrations of adherence compounds to media with no or low adherence compound concentrations were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors selected trials for inclusion according to the above criteria, after which the same two review authors independently extracted data for subsequent analysis. Statistical analysis was performed according to the guidelines developed by Cochrane. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons. Main results We analysed 26 studies with a total of 6704 participants. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and/or heterogeneity. Compared to embryos transferred in media containing no or low (0.125 mg/mL) HA, the addition of functional (0.5 mg/mL) HA concentrations to the transfer media probably increases the live birth rate (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.31; 10 RCTs, N = 4066; I² = 33%; moderate‐quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no HA addition in media is assumed to be 33%, the chance following HA addition would be between 37% and 44%. The addition of HA may slightly decrease miscarriage rates (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 7 RCTs, N = 3091; I² = 66%; low‐quality evidence). Nevertheless, when only studies with low risk of bias were included in the analysis, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.23; N = 2219; I² = 36%). Adding HA to transfer media probably results in an increase in both clinical pregnancy (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23; 17 studies, N = 5247; I² = 40%; moderate‐quality evidence) and multiple pregnancy rates (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.70; 7 studies, N = 3337; I² = 36%; moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of HA added to transfer media on the rate of total adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.84; 3 studies, N = 1487; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence shows improved clinical pregnancy and live birth rates with the addition of HA as an adherence compound in embryo transfer media in ART. Low‐quality evidence suggests that adding HA may slightly decrease miscarriage rates, but when only studies at low risk of bias were included in the analysis, the results were inconclusive. HA had no clear effect on the rate of total adverse events. The increase in multiple pregnancy rates may be due to combining an adherence compound and transferring more than one embryo. Further studies of adherence compounds with single embryo transfer need to be undertaken.","In IVF, does transferring the embryo in media containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid result in more live births? What is IVF? In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a fertility treatment that helps people with fertility problems to have a baby. During IVF an egg from a woman's ovaries is fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The egg can be placed in a dish with multiple sperm to fertilise it, or a single sperm can be injected directly into it (intracytoplasmic sperm injection; ICSI). The fertilised egg (an embryo) is then placed (implanted) into the woman's womb to grow and develop. The embryo is transferred to the womb in a special transfer media, a solution containing compounds that help the embryo stick (adhere) successfully to the inside of the womb (implantation). Hyaluronic acid is a natural compound found in the body that acts as a binding and protective agent in tissues. It is often added to embryo transfer media to help implant the embryo. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out whether using transfer media with high concentrations of adherence compounds for embryo transfer such as hyaluronic acid improves success in implanting embryos, resulting in more live births. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated the use of embryo transfer media containing different concentrations of hyaluronic acid in IVF/ICSI. We looked for randomised controlled studies in which the treatments received are decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We assessed the evidence by looking at how the studies were conducted, study sizes, and whether study findings were consistent. Search date:  we included evidence published up to January 2020. What we found We found 26 studies including 6704 women aged 27 to 35 years who underwent IVF/ICSI. These studies compared embryo transfer using media containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid versus solutions containing no or low concentrations of hyaluronic acid. We were interested in learning how the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the transfer solution affected the numbers of: · live births; · miscarriages (loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks' gestation); · clinical pregnancies; · multiple pregnancies; and · adverse (unwanted) events. What are the results of our review? Embryo transfer using media with high concentrations of hyaluronic acid probably increases the number of live births compared with using solutions with low concentrations or no hyaluronic acid (10 studies). If transfer media with low concentrations or no hyaluronic acid have a 33% chance of resulting in a live birth, solutions with high concentrations increase the chance of a live birth to between 37% and 44%. There would probably be 1 additional live birth for every 14 embryos transferred in a high‐concentration hyaluronic acid solution. High concentrations of hyaluronic acid in the embryo transfer solution probably also increase the number of clinical pregnancies (17 studies) and the number of multiple pregnancies (7 studies). Using transfer solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid may result in slightly fewer miscarriages (7 studies). But our analysis did not show a clear difference if we left out studies whose results varied widely. Reported adverse events included ectopic pregnancies (when an embryo becomes implanted outside the womb) and abnormalities affecting the embryo or the foetus. Similar numbers of adverse events were reported for both types of transfer solution (high and low concentrations of hyaluronic acid): we found no evidence that the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the transfer solution affected the number of adverse events reported. How reliable are these results? We are moderately confident about our results for the numbers of live births, clinical pregnancies, and multiple pregnancies. Our results may change if further evidence becomes available. We are less confident about the rate of miscarriage and the number of adverse events, because results for these varied widely. Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. Conclusions Embryo transfer using solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid probably increases the number of live births in IVF/ICSI. Transfer solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid may slightly decrease the rate of miscarriage.",CD007421
"Background Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an optic neuropathy with high intraocular pressure (IOP) that manifests within the first few years of a child's life and is not associated with other systemic or ocular abnormalities. PCG results in considerable morbidity even in high‐income countries. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques for PCG. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed;  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) (last searched 23 June 2014); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 27 April 2020. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different surgical interventions in children under five years of age with PCG. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodology. Main results We included 16 trials (13 RCTs and three quasi‐RCTs) with 587 eyes in 446 children. Eleven (69%) trials were conducted in Egypt and the Middle East, three in India, and two in the USA. All included trials involved children younger than five years of age, with follow‐up ranging from six to 80 months. The interventions compared varied across trials. Three trials (on 68 children) compared combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy (CTT) with trabeculotomy. Meta‐analysis of these trials suggests there may be little to no evidence of a difference between groups in mean IOP (mean difference (MD) 0.27 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.74 to 1.29; 88 eyes; 2 studies) and surgical success (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 102 eyes; 3 studies) at one year postoperatively. We assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for these outcomes, downgrading for risk of bias (‐1) and imprecision (‐2). Hyphema was the most common adverse outcome in both groups (no meta‐analysis due to considerable heterogeneity; I 2  = 83%). Two trials (on 39 children) compared viscotrabeculotomy to conventional trabeculotomy. Meta‐analysis of 42 eyes suggests there is no evidence of between groups difference in mean IOP (MD −1.64, 95% CI −5.94 to 2.66) and surgical success (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.78) at six months postoperatively. We assessed the certainty of evidence as very low, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision due to small sample size. Hyphema was the most common adverse outcome (38% in viscotrabeculotomy and 28% in conventional trabeculotomy), with no evidence of difference difference (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.83). Two trials (on 95 children) compared microcatheter‐assisted 360‐degree circumferential trabeculotomy to conventional trabeculotomy. Meta‐analysis of two trials suggests that mean IOP may be lower in the microcatheter group at six months (MD −2.44, 95% CI −3.69 to −1.19; 100 eyes) and at 12 months (MD −1.77, 95% CI −2.92 to −0.63; 99 eyes); and surgical success was more likely to be achieved in the microcatheter group compared to the conventional trabeculotomy group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.21; 60 eyes; 1 trial at 6 months; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97; 99 eyes; 2 trials at 12 months). We assessed the certainty of evidence for these outcomes as moderate due to small sample size. Hyphema was the most common adverse outcome (40% in the microcatheter group and 17% in the conventional trabeculotomy group), with greater likelihood of occurring in the microcatheter group (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.04); the evidence was of moderate certainty due to small sample size (−1). Of the nine remaining trials, no two trials compared the same two surgical interventions: one trial compared CTT versus CTT with sclerectomy; three trials compared various suturing techniques and adjuvant use including mitomycin C, collagen implant in CTT; one trial compared CTT versus Ahmed valve implant in previously failed surgeries; one trial compared CTT with trabeculectomy; one trial compared trabeculotomy to goniotomy; and two trials compared different types of goniotomy. No trials reported quality of life or economic data. Many of the included trials had limitations in study design, implementation, and reporting, therefore the reliability and applicability of the evidence remains unclear. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that there may be little to no evidence of difference between CTT and routine conventional trabeculotomy, or between viscotrabeculotomy and routine conventional trabeculotomy .  A 360‐degree circumferential trabeculotomy may show greater surgical success than conventional trabeculotomy. Considering the rarity of the disease, future research would benefit from a multicenter, possibly international trial, involving parents of children with PCG and with a follow‐up of at least one year.","What are the benefits and risks of different surgical approaches for primary congenital glaucoma (an eye condition that affects children under five years old)? Why this question is important  Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a rare disease of the optic nerve. It affects children who are under five years old, and is caused by abnormally high pressure in the eye. This develops when the eye’s drainage system does not work properly, and fluid builds up in the eye. The increased pressure in the eye can damage the optic nerve, and cause partial—or even total—blindness. The most common treatment for PCG is surgery. There are different surgical approaches that aim to decrease pressure in the eye. For example, in goniotomy an incision is made to create an opening on the inside of the eye, through which fluid can drain, while in trabeculotomy an incision is made on the outside of the eye. A third technique, trabeculectomy, involves removing some tissue from the eye to create an opening; this may be combined with trabeculotomy. As with any medical treatment, each surgical approach for PCG has potential benefits and risks. To find out whether some surgical procedures are more beneficial, or cause more unwanted effects, than others, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. How we identified and assessed the evidence  First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered such factors as the way studies were conducted, study size, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. What we found  We found 16 studies with a total of 446 children with PCG. The children were followed for between six and 80 months after surgery. Eleven studies were conducted in Egypt and the Middle East, three in India, and two in the USA. Trabeculectomy plus trabeculotomy versus trabeculectomy alone Three studies (on 68 children) compared trabeculectomy combined with trabeculotomy, against trabeculectomy alone. The studies were poorly conducted and small, and results were inconsistent across the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). So, we cannot tell from these studies which surgical approach is more successful or causes fewer unwanted effects. Viscotrabeculotomy versus conventional trabeculotomy Two studies (on 39 children) compared viscotrabeculotomy (a type of trabeculotomy that uses a thick liquid to create an opening in the eye’s drainage system) with conventional trabeculotomy. The studies were poorly conducted and small (very low‐certainty evidence), so we cannot tell from these studies which surgical approach is more successful or causes fewer unwanted effects. Trabeculotomy (microcatheter assisted, 360‐degree) versus conventional trabeculotomy Two studies (on 95 children) compared another type of trabeculotomy (microcatheter‐assisted 360‐degree trabeculotomy)—where an opening is made all around the eye with the help of a very small, hollow tube—against conventional trabeculotomy. The evidence was of moderate certainty, because the studies were well conducted, but small. The evidence suggests that microcatheter‐assisted 360‐degree trabeculotomy probably reduces eye pressure slightly one year after surgery. Children given this treatment are probably more likely to have normal eye pressure (under 21 mmHg) one year after surgery than those who have conventional trabeculotomy. However, the evidence suggests that they are probably more likely to also experience hyphema, a side effect in which blood collects at the front of the eye, partially or completely blocking vision. Other surgical procedures None of the remaining nine trials investigated the same surgical procedures. This means that for many surgical procedures for PCG, such as trabeculectomy on its own or goniotomy, there is too little evidence to determine whether one method is better or causes more unwanted effects than others. Conclusion  The evidence on the comparative benefits and risks of different surgical procedures for PCG is limited. Microcatheter‐assisted 360‐degree trabeculotomy is probably more beneficial than standard trabeculotomy, but probably causes more unwanted effects. We do not know the comparative effects of other surgical procedures, as there are either no studies or too few studies that compare them.

"Background According to international guidelines and literature, all patients with intermittent claudication should receive an initial treatment of cardiovascular risk modification, lifestyle coaching, and supervised exercise therapy. In the literature, supervised exercise therapy often consists of treadmill or track walking. However, alternative modes of exercise therapy have been described and yielded similar results to walking. This raises the following question: which exercise mode produces the most favourable results? This is the first update of the original review published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of alternative modes of supervised exercise therapy compared to traditional walking exercise in patients with intermittent claudication. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 4 March 2019. We also undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials comparing alternative modes of exercise training or combinations of exercise modes with a control group of supervised walking exercise in patients with clinically determined intermittent claudication. The supervised walking programme needed to be supervised at least twice a week for a consecutive six weeks of training. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for each study. As we included studies with different treadmill test protocols and different measuring units (metres, minutes, or seconds), the standardised mean difference (SMD) approach was used for summary statistics of mean walking distance (MWD) and pain‐free walking distance (PFWD). Summary estimates were obtained for all outcome measures using a random‐effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results For this update, five additional studies were included, making a total of 10 studies that randomised a total of 527 participants with intermittent claudication (IC). The alternative modes of exercise therapy included cycling, lower‐extremity resistance training, upper‐arm ergometry, Nordic walking, and combinations of exercise modes. Besides randomised controlled trials, two quasi‐randomised trials were included. Overall risk of bias in included studies varied from high to low. According to GRADE criteria, the certainty of the evidence was downgraded to low, due to the relatively small sample sizes, clinical inconsistency, and inclusion of three studies with risk of bias concerns. Overall, comparing alternative exercise modes versus walking showed no clear differences for MWD at 12 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.29 to 0.27; P = 0.95; 6 studies; 274 participants; low‐certainty evidence); or at the end of training (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.11; P = 0.32; 9 studies; 412 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Similarly, no clear differences were detected in PFWD at 12 weeks (SMD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.25; P = 0.97; 5 studies; 249 participants; low‐certainty evidence); or at the end of training (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.17; P = 0.59; 8 studies, 382 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies reported on health‐related quality of life (HR‐QoL) and three studies reported on functional impairment. As the studies used different measurements, meta‐analysis was only possible for the walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ) distance score, which demonstrated little or no difference between groups (MD ‐5.52, 95% CI ‐17.41 to 6.36; P = 0.36; 2 studies; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions This review found no clear difference between alternative exercise modes and supervised walking exercise in improving the maximum and pain‐free walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. The certainty of this evidence was judged to be low, due to clinical inconsistency, small sample size and risk of bias concerns. The findings of this review indicate that alternative exercise modes may be useful when supervised walking exercise is not an option. More RCTs with adequate methodological quality and sufficient power are needed to provide solid evidence for comparisons between each alternative exercise mode and the current standard of supervised treadmill walking. Future RCTs should investigate outcome measures on walking behaviour, physical activity, cardiovascular risk, and HR‐QoL, using standardised testing methods and reporting of outcomes to allow meaningful comparison across studies.","How effective are supervised exercise programmes compared to supervised walking programmes for treating intermittent claudication? Why this question is important Intermittent claudication is the medical term for pain in the lower leg (or both legs) that develops during exercise (for example, walking) and usually goes away after a few minutes’ rest. This pain is produced by a restriction of blood flow to the leg muscles. This restriction in blood flow is caused by the partial blockage of arteries (vessels that deliver oxygen‐rich blood around the body) by a build‐up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This results in a reduced oxygen supply reaching the leg muscles. International guidelines recommend that people with intermittent claudication should exercise by walking (for example, on a treadmill) while supervised by a physical or exercise therapist. The goal of these exercises is to increase the distance people can walk, and to limit the impact of intermittent claudication on their quality of life. Supervised walking programmes are not the only type of supervised exercise available. There are other options, such as strength training, Nordic walking (walking with specially designed poles to exercise the upper as well as the lower body) or cycling. To find out how effective other types of supervised exercise programmes are compared to supervised walking programmes, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. How we identified and assessed the evidence First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. What we found We found ten studies on a total of 527 people with intermittent claudication. The studies compared supervised walking programmes against: * exercises to strengthen the leg muscles (four studies); * Nordic walking (three studies); * cycling (one study); * arm ergometry (pedalling with the arms on an exercise machine – one study); * a combination of different types of exercise (four studies). The programmes lasted between six and 24 weeks. The evidence suggests that there may be little to no difference between supervised walking and other types of supervised exercise in terms of: * the average maximum distance that people can walk after 12 weeks of exercise, or once they have completed the exercise programme; * the average distance that people can walk without feeling pain after 12 weeks of exercise, or once they have completed the exercise programme; or * disability (after 12 to 24 weeks of exercise). We do not know if there is a difference in quality of life, since the studies that investigated this used different measurement tools to assess it, and we could not compare the results. What this means This review suggests that supervised walking and other types of supervised exercise programmes may have similar effects on how far people with intermittent claudication can walk, and how far they can walk without pain. However, our confidence in this finding is limited, mainly because: * the studies we reviewed were small; * the types of supervised walking exercises that were evaluated varied across studies; and * concerns about how some studies were conducted. Future studies that use robust methods and include large numbers of people are needed to provide stronger evidence for comparing different types of supervised exercise programmes for intermittent claudication. How‐up‐to date is this review? The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2019.",CD009638
"Background Oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of sulfasalazine (SASP) while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. It was previously found that 5‐ASA drugs in doses of at least 2 g/day were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP for inducing remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the efficacy, dose‐responsiveness and safety of oral 5‐ASA compared to placebo, SASP, or 5‐ASA comparators (i.e. other formulations of 5‐ASA) for induction of remission in active UC. A secondary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of once‐daily dosing of oral 5‐ASA versus conventional dosing regimens (two or three times daily). Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 11 June 2019. We also searched references, conference proceedings and study registers to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults (aged 18 years or more) with active UC for inclusion. We included studies that compared oral 5‐ASA therapy with placebo, SASP, or other 5‐ASA formulations. We also included studies that compared once‐daily to conventional dosing as well as dose‐ranging studies. Data collection and analysis Outcomes include failure to induce global/clinical remission, global/clinical improvement, endoscopic remission, endoscopic improvement, adherence, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawals due to AEs, and withdrawals or exclusions after entry. We analyzed five comparisons: 5‐ASA versus placebo, 5‐ASA versus sulfasalazine, once‐daily dosing versus conventional dosing, 5‐ASA (e.g. MMX mesalamine, Ipocol, Balsalazide, Pentasa, Olsalazine and 5‐ASA micropellets) versus comparator 5‐ASA (e.g. Asacol, Claversal, Salofalk), and 5‐ASA dose‐ranging. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. We analyzed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis, and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. Main results We include 54 studies (9612 participants). We rated most studies at low risk of bias. Seventy‐one per cent (1107/1550) of 5‐ASA participants failed to enter clinical remission compared to 83% (695/837) of placebo participants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89; 2387 participants, 11 studies; high‐certainty evidence). We also observed a dose‐response trend for 5‐ASA. There was no difference in clinical remission rates between 5‐ASA and SASP. Fifty‐four per cent (150/279) of 5‐ASA participants failed to enter remission compared to 58% (144/247) of SASP participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04; 526 participants, 8 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in remission rates between once‐daily dosing and conventional dosing. Sixty per cent (533/881) of once‐daily participants failed to enter clinical remission compared to 61% (538/880) of conventionally‐dosed participants (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06; 1761 participants, 5 studies; high‐certainty evidence). Eight per cent (15/179) of participants dosed once daily failed to adhere to their medication regimen compared to 6% (11/179) of conventionally‐dosed participants (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.86; 358 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy among the various 5‐ASA formulations. Fifty per cent (507/1022) of participants in the 5‐ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 52% (491/946) of participants in the 5‐ASA comparator group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; 1968 participants, 11 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events between 5‐ASA and placebo, once‐daily and conventionally‐dosed 5‐ASA, and 5‐ASA and comparator 5‐ASA formulation studies. Common adverse events included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache and worsening UC. SASP was not as well tolerated as 5‐ASA. Twenty‐nine per cent (118/411) of SASP participants experienced an AE compared to 15% (72/498) of 5‐ASA participants (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; 909 participants, 12 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions There is high‐certainty evidence that 5‐ASA is superior to placebo, and moderate‐certainty evidence that 5‐ASA is not more effective than SASP. Considering relative costs, a clinical advantage to using oral 5‐ASA in place of SASP appears unlikely. High‐certainty evidence suggests 5‐ASA dosed once daily appears to be as efficacious as conventionally‐dosed 5‐ASA. There may be little or no difference in efficacy or safety among the various 5‐ASA formulations.","Oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis What is ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a condition that causes inflammation of your large intestine (colon). Some of the symptoms associated with UC include diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, fatigue and fever. What is 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA)? Sulfasalazine (SASP) has been used for treating UC for decades. SASP is made up of 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) linked to a sulfur molecule. Up to a third of people treated with SASP have reported side effects, which are thought to be related to the sulfur part of the molecule. Common side effects associated with SASP include nausea, indigestion, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. 5‐ASA drugs were developed to avoid the side effects associated with SASP. 5‐ASA is commonly taken by mouth. What did the researchers investigate? The researchers examined whether oral 5‐ASA helps to cause remission in people with UC. The researchers investigated whether oral 5‐ASA was better than placebo (a fake medication) or a different 5‐ASA formulation. Key results This review includes 54 randomized trials with a total of 9612 people taking part. The review includes studies published up to June 2019. Oral 5‐ASA was found to be more effective than placebo (fake drug). Although oral 5‐ASA drugs are effective for treating active UC, they are no more effective than SASP therapy. People taking 5‐ASA are less likely to experience side effects than those taking SASP. Side effects associated with 5‐ASA are generally mild in nature, and common side effects include digestive tract symptoms (e.g. flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea), headache and worsening UC. 5‐ASA compounds are more expensive than SASP, so SASP may be the preferred option where cost is an important factor. 5‐ASA given once daily appears to be as effective as 5‐ASA given in the usual way (two or three times daily). There do not appear to be any differences in effectiveness or safety among the various 5‐ASA formulations. Conclusions High‐certainty evidence suggests that 5‐ASA is superior to placebo and that 5‐ASA once‐daily dose has the same effectiveness and safety as the conventional 5‐ASA dose. Moderate‐certainty evidence also suggests that 5‐ASA is not superior to SASP. Sticking to the medication does not appear to improve with once‐daily dosing compared to conventional dosing. Lastly, there may be little or no difference in effectiveness or safety among the various 5‐ASA formulations.",CD000543
"Background Ketogenic diets (KDs) are high in fat and low in carbohydrates and have been suggested to reduce seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Such diets may be beneficial for children with drug‐resistant epilepsy. This is an update of a review first published in 2003, and last updated in 2018. Objectives To assess the effects of ketogenic diets for people with drug‐resistant epilepsy. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 April 2019) on 29 April 2019. The Cochrane Register of Studies includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional relevant studies. Selection criteria RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of KDs for people of any age with drug‐resistant epilepsy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied predefined criteria to extract data and evaluated study quality. We assessed the outcomes: seizure freedom, seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency), adverse effects, cognition and behaviour, quality of life, and attrition rate. We incorporated a meta‐analysis. We utilised an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population for all primary analyses. We presented the results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified 13 studies with 932 participants; 711 children (4 months to 18 years) and 221 adults (16 years and over). We assessed all 13 studies to be at high risk of performance and detection bias, due to lack of blinding. Assessments varied from low to high risk of bias for all other domains. We rated the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low certainty. Ketogenic diets versus usual care for children Seizure freedom (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.35; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 385 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and seizure reduction (RR 5.80, 95% CI 3.48 to 9.65; P < 0.001; 4 studies, 385 participants; low‐certainty evidence) favoured KDs (including: classic KD, medium‐chain triglyceride (MCT) KD combined, MCT KD only, simplified modified Atkins diet (MAD) compared to usual care for children. We are not confident that these estimated effects are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea for both the intervention and usual care group, but the true effect could be substantially different (low‐certainty evidence). Ketogenic diet versus usual care for adults In adults, no participants experienced seizure freedom. Seizure reduction favoured KDs (MAD only) over usual care but, again, we are not confident that the effect estimated is accurate (RR 5.03, 95% CI 0.26 to 97.68; P = 0.29; 2 studies, 141 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adults receiving MAD most commonly reported vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence). One study reported a reduction in body mass index (BMI) plus increased cholesterol in the MAD group. The other reported weight loss. The true effect could be substantially different to that reported. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for children Up to 55% of children achieved seizure freedom with a classical 4:1 KD after three months whilst up to 85% of children achieved seizure reduction (very low‐certainty evidence). One trial reported a greater incidence of seizure reduction with gradual‐onset KD, as opposed to fasting‐onset KD. Up to 25% of children were seizure free with MAD and up to 60% achieved seizure reduction. Up to 25% of children became seizure free with MAD and up to 60% experienced seizure reduction. One study used a simplified MAD (sMAD) and reported that 15% of children gained seizure freedom rates and 56% achieved seizure reduction. We judged all the evidence described as very low certainty, thus we are very unsure whether the results are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (5 studies, very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported weight loss. One stated that weight loss and gastrointestinal disturbances were more frequent, with 4:1 versus 3:1 KD, whilst one reported no difference in weight loss with 20 mg/d versus 10 mg/d carbohydrates. In one study, there was a higher incidence of hypercalcuria amongst children receiving classic KD compared to MAD. All effects described are unlikely to be accurate. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for adults One study randomised 80 adults (aged 18 years and over) to either MAD plus KetoCal during the first month with MAD alone for the second month, or MAD alone for the first month followed by MAD plus KetoCal for the second month. No adults achieved seizure freedom. More adults achieved seizure reduction at one month with MAD alone (42.5%) compared to MAD plus KetoCal (32.5%), however, by three months only 10% of adults in both groups maintained seizure reduction. The evidence for both outcomes was of very low certainty; we are very uncertain whether the effects are accurate. Constipation was more frequently reported in the MAD plus KetoCal group (17.5%) compared to the MAD only group (5%) (1 study, very low‐certainty evidence). Diarrhoea and increase/change in seizure pattern/semiology were also commonly reported (17.5% to 20% of participants). The true effects of the diets could be substantially different to that reported. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that KDs could demonstrate effectiveness in children with drug‐resistant epilepsy, however, the evidence for the use of KDs in adults remains uncertain. We identified a limited number of studies which all had small sample sizes. Due to the associated risk of bias and imprecision caused by small study populations, the evidence for the use of KDs was of low to very low certainty. More palatable but related diets, such as the MAD, may have a similar effect on seizure control as the classical KD, but could be associated with fewer adverse effects. This assumption requires more investigation. For people who have drug‐resistant epilepsy or who are unsuitable for surgical intervention, KDs remain a valid option. Further research is required, particularly for adults with drug‐resistant epilepsy.","Ketogenic diets for drug‐resistant epilepsy Background Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. In most people, seizures can be controlled by one or more antiepileptic medicines. For people who continue to have seizures (drug‐resistant epilepsy) a special diet, a ketogenic diet, may be considered. Ketogenic diets are high in fat and low in carbohydrate. This review looked at the effects of ketogenic diets on seizure control, learning and memory, and behaviour. We also investigated the side effects of the diet and the number of people who withdrew from studies, plus the reasons why. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for clinical trials of adults or children with epilepsy, where a ketogenic diet was compared with other treatments. We found 13 trials, with 932 participants. The trials were between two and 16 months long. Key results Children given ketogenic diets may be up to three times more likely to achieve seizure freedom and up to six times more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to children given their usual care. Although the rates of seizure freedom reported by most of the studies were fairly modest, in one study over half of the children given a classical ketogenic diet became seizure free. This rate reduced to only 15% of children achieving seizure freedom when they were given a less restrictive modified Atkins diet. Another study reported that 85% of children given a classical ketogenic diet had a significant reduction in their number of seizures compared to only around half of children who received a modified Atkins diet. One study, however, found similar effects on seizure control with the better tolerated modified Atkins diet as with the more restrictive ketogenic diet, highlighting that more research is required. There were no reports of seizure freedom in adults following ketogenic diets, however, adults given ketogenic diets may be up to five times more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. All studies reported people dropping out due to lack of improved seizures and poor tolerance of diet. Adults following ketogenic diets may be up to five times more likely to drop out of studies compared with usual care. For children, dropout rates may be similar in ketogenic diet and usual care treatment groups. One study reported the effects of ketogenic diets on quality of life, learning, memory, and behaviour in children. The study suggested no difference in the quality of life of children following a ketogenic diet and those receiving usual care. Children following ketogenic diets were suggested to be more active, more productive and less anxious, but more research is needed. Certainty of the evidence The trials only included a small number of people and their methods were unclear. We therefore judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low. This means that we are not confident that the results described are accurate of the true effect of ketogenic diets in people with epilepsy. This evidence is current to April 2019.",CD001903
"Background The success of digital replantation is highly dependent on the patency of the repaired vessels after microvascular anastomosis. Antithrombotic agents are frequently used for preventing vascular occlusion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been reported to be as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in peripheral vascular surgery, but with fewer adverse effects. Its benefit in microvascular surgery such as digital replantation is unclear. This is an update of the review first published in 2013. Objectives To assess if treatment with subcutaneous LMWH improves the salvage rate of the digits in patients with digital replantation after traumatic amputation. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers, to 17 March 2020. The authors searched PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Electronic Periodical Services (CEPS) on 17 March 2020 and sought additional trials from reference lists of relevant publications. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing treatment with LMWH versus any other treatment in participants who received digital replantation following traumatic digital amputation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (PL, CC) independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included two new randomised trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials to four. They included a total of 258 participants, with at least 273 digits, from hospitals in China. Three studies compared LMWH versus UFH, and one compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The mean age of participants ranged from 24.5 to 37.6 years. In the studies reporting the sex of participants, there were a total of 145 men and 59 women. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded to low or very low because all studies were at high risk of performance or reporting bias (or both) and there was imprecision in the results due to the small numbers of participants. The three studies comparing LMWH versus UFH reported the success rate of replantation using different units of analysis (participant or digit), so we were unable to combine data from all three studies (one study reported results for both participants and digits). No evidence of a benefit in success of replantation was seen in the LMWH group when compared with UFH, regardless of whether the outcomes were reported by number of participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.10; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence); or by number of digits (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 200 digits, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the incidence of compromised microcirculation requiring surgical or non‐surgical therapy, or any systemic/other causes of microvascular insufficiency. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the LMWH and UFH groups in occurrence of arterial occlusion (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence) or venous occlusion (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.27; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported adverse effects. The LMWH and UFH groups showed no evidence of a difference in wound bleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.23; 130 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), haematuria (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.11; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), ecchymoses (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.19; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), epistaxis (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), gingival bleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.43; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), and faecal occult blood (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). We could not pool data on coagulation abnormalities as varying definitions and tests were used in the three studies. One study compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The success rate of replantation, when analysed by digits, was reported as 91.2% success in the LMWH group and 82.1% in the control group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring surgical re‐exploration, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.58; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring incision occurred in five out of 34 digits (14.7%) in the LMWH group and eight out of 39 digits (20.5%) in the control group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits; very low‐certainty evidence). Microvascular insufficiency due to arterial occlusion, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.05; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence), and venous occlusion was 14.7% in the LMWH group and 20.5% in the control (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report complications or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions There is currently low to very low‐certainty evidence, based on four RCTs, suggesting no evidence of a benefit from LMWH when compared to UFH on the success rates of replantation or affect microvascular insufficiency due to vessel occlusion (analysed by digit or participant). LMWH had similar success rates of replantation; and the incidence rate of venous and arterial microvascular insufficiency showed no evidence of a difference between groups when LMWH was compared to no LMWH (analysed by digit). Similar rates of complications and adverse effects were seen between UFH and LMWH. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on any effect on coagulation when comparing LMWH to UFH or no LMWH. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to performance and reporting bias, as well as imprecision in the results. Further adequately powered studies are warranted to provide high‐certainty evidence.","Low molecular weight heparin for preventing blockage of blood vessels in replanted fingers or toes after amputation injuries Background Microvascular surgery refers to any surgery involving small‐sized blood vessels that is performed under the operating microscope, allowing, for example, for the repair of arteries and veins of amputated parts to the body. These vessels are typically 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. Replantation is the reattachment of a completely detached body part, with fingers and thumbs being the most commonly replanted body parts. This is often referred to as digital replantation. In principle, digital replantation involves not only restoring the blood flow through the arteries and veins but also restoring the bony skeleton of the toes, fingers or thumbs, along with repairing the tendons and nerves, if necessary. Occlusion (blockage) of one or more of the repaired vessels due to the formation of a clot within the blood vessel can result in failure of the replantation. Anticoagulant medications are used to reduce clotting, and they could potentially prevent such a complication. Anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) have therefore been used to prevent clot formation after digital replantation. It is unclear if low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has similar benefit. Key results A randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical study in which people have an equal chance of receiving the treatment or a comparator. This systematic review identified four RCTs comparing LMWH with either UFH or no LMWH. The trials included a total of 258 people with at least 273 replanted fingers or toes (digits). The evidence is up‐to‐date to 17 March 2020. The trials differed in which results they reported and how they reported them, so we could not combine all the information. Three trials showed no evidence of a benefit of LMWH when compared with UFH in the success rate of replantation, microvascular insufficiency due to vessel occlusion (poor blood flow due to blockages in the small‐sized blood vessels), and side effects such as bleeding. There was no evidence of clear differences between the use of LMWH or no LWMH in the success rate of replantation in one study. Similarly, no evidence of clear differences in the incidence of reduced blood flow (compromised microcirculation) requiring further microvascular surgery (re‐exploration or incision), or causes of microvascular insufficiency due to vessel blockage, were detected in the study which analysed by digits or people. The limited evidence, which we judged to be of low to very low certainty, suggests there is no clear benefit of LMWH in increasing the success rate of replantation or preventing microvascular occlusion in digital replantation when compared to UFH or no LMWH. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of evidence is very low due to limitations in study design and reporting. For example, the studies did not take measures to hide from a person which treatment they had, and they reported results that were not stated in the original plan. The sample size of included studies was not large enough to provide precise effect estimates. There is a need for large studies that are designed to reduce these study limitations.",CD009894
"Background Although highly effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not universally accepted by users. Educational, supportive and behavioural interventions may help people with OSA initiate and maintain regular and continued use of CPAP. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of educational, supportive, behavioural, or mixed (combination of two or more intervention types) strategies that aim to encourage adults who have been prescribed CPAP to use their devices. Search methods Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches are current to 29 April 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed intervention(s) designed to inform participants about CPAP/OSA, to support them in using CPAP, or to modify their behaviour to increase use of CPAP devices. Data collection and analysis We assessed studies to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted independently and were entered into RevMan for analysis. 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed, using the updated 'Risk of bias 2' tool, for the primary outcome, CPAP usage. Study‐level 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed using the original 'Risk of bias' tool. GRADE assessment was performed using GRADEpro. Main results Forty‐one studies (9005 participants) are included in this review; 16 of these studies are newly identified with updated searches. Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores indicate that most participants suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness. The majority of recruited participants had not used CPAP previously. When examining risk of bias for the primary outcome of hourly machine usage/night, 58.3% studies have high overall risk (24/41 studies), 39.0% have some concerns (16/41 studies), and 2.4% have low overall risk (1/41 studies). We are uncertain whether educational interventions improve device usage, as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. We were unable to perform meta‐analyses for number of withdrawals and symptom scores due to high study heterogeneity. Supportive interventions probably increase device usage by 0.70 hours/night (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.05, N = 1426, 13 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence), and low‐certainty evidence indicates that the number of participants who used their devices ≥ 4 hours/night may increase from 601 to 717 per 1000 (odds ratio (OR), 1.68, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.60, N = 376, 2 studies). However, the number of withdrawals may also increase from 136 to 167 per 1000 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.66, N = 1702, 11 studies, low‐certainty evidence). Participants may experience small improvements in symptoms (ESS score ‐0.32 points, 95% CI ‐1.19 to 0.56, N = 470, 5 studies, low‐certainty evidence), and we are uncertain whether quality of life improves with supportive interventions, as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. When compared with usual care, behavioural interventions produce a clinically‐meaningful increase in device usage by 1.31 hours/night (95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, N = 578, 8 studies, high‐certainty evidence), probably increase the number of participants who used their machines ≥ 4 hours/night from 371 to 501 per 1000 (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.41, N = 549, 6 studies, high‐certainty evidence), and reduce the number of study withdrawals from 146 to 101 per 1000 (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98, N = 939, 10 studies, high‐certainty evidence). Behavioural interventions may reduce symptoms (ESS score ‐2.42 points, 95% CI ‐4.27 to ‐0.57, N = 272, 5 studies, low‐certainty evidence), but probably have no effect on quality of life (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 0.95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.26, N = 228, 3 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether behavioural interventions improve apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI), as the certainty of evidence was assessed as very low. We are uncertain if mixed interventions improve device usage, increase the number of participants using their machines ≥ 4 hours/night, reduce study withdrawals, improve quality of life, or reduce anxiety symptoms, as the certainty of evidence for these outcomes was assessed to be very low. Symptom scores via the ESS could not be measured due to considerable heterogeneity between studies. Authors' conclusions In CPAP‐naïve people with OSA, high‐certainty evidence indicates that behavioural interventions yield a clinically‐significant increase in hourly device usage when compared with usual care. Moderate certainty evidence shows that supportive interventions increase usage modestly. Very low‐certainty evidence shows that educational and mixed interventions may modestly increase CPAP usage. The impact of improved CPAP usage on daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and mood and anxiety scores remains unclear since these outcomes were not assessed in the majority of included studies. Studies addressing the choice of interventions that best match individual patient needs and therefore result in the most successful and cost‐effective therapy are needed.","Do supportive, educational and behavioural interventions improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea? What is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)? Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. People with OSA spend more time in light sleep and less time in deep sleep and consequently experience daytime sleepiness, which may affect their daily life. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a treatment that delivers pressurised air to keep the airway open. CPAP treatment involves a machine with three main parts: a device that fits over nose and mouth, a tube that connects the mask to the device's motor; and a motor that blows air into the tube. Review question We already know that CPAP treats OSA effectively in most people by improving symptoms resulting from OSA. However many people do not use their CPAP machine as much as is recommended. We wanted to look at interventions designed to educate and motivate people with OSA to use their CPAP machines more. Study characteristics We looked at evidence from randomised, parallel‐group, controlled studies. Following a comprehensive literature search and assessment of trials, we included 41 studies (number of participants = 9005). Most people experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and had newly diagnosed OSA. Duration of studies ranged from 28 days to two years. Results We grouped the trials into those that gave people a) education, b) a supportive intervention, c) behavioural intervention, and d) a mixed intervention (using all thee techniques). We found that all types of interventions increase CPAP usage with varying levels of certainty. Behavioural therapy increases machine usage by 79 minutes per night, and ongoing supportive interventions probably increase machine use by about 42 minutes per night. Educational and mixed interventions may potentially improve machine usage, however the certainty of this evidence is very low. We also wanted to look at other outcomes such as daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life, depression, and apnoea hypopnoea index (measurement of pauses in breathing and slow or shallow breathing). Not all included studies consistently examined these other outcomes, however behavioural interventions may reduce daytime sleepiness. Studies generally recruited people who were new to CPAP. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence for improved CPAP adherence varied considerably across studies and study types. We were confident that the behavioural interventions improve adherence for around 70 minutes per night. The quality of evidence for educational, supportive, and mixed interventions was not as strong. The quality of evidence for OSA‐related symptoms including daytime sleepiness, quality of life, anxiety or depression was affected by the low number of studies that measured these outcomes.",CD007736
"Background Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders. The predominant symptom associated with sickle cell disease is pain resulting from the occlusion of small blood vessels by abnormally 'sickle‐shaped' red blood cells. There are other complications, including chronic organ damage and prolonged painful erection of the penis, known as priapism. Severity of sickle cell disease is variable, and treatment is usually symptomatic. Priapism affects up to half of all men with sickle cell disease, however, there is no consistency in treatment. We therefore need to know the best way of treating this complication in order to offer an effective interventional approach to all affected individuals. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched trial registries. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 September 2019. Date of most recent search of trial registries and of Embase: 01 October 2019. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing non‐surgical or surgical treatment with placebo or no treatment, or with another intervention for stuttering or fulminant priapism. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the trials. Main results Three trials with 102 participants were identified and met the criteria for inclusion in this review. These trials compared stilboestrol to placebo, sildenafil to placebo and a four‐arm trial which compared ephedrine or etilefrine to placebo and ranged in duration from two weeks to six months. All of the trials were conducted in an outpatient setting in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK. None of the trials measured our first primary outcome, detumescence. However, all three trials reported on the reduction in frequency of stuttering priapism, our second primary outcome; and from the evidence included in this review, we are uncertain whether stilboestrol, etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the frequency of stuttering priapism as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Additionally, we conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference (low‐certainty evidence). Two trials reported on immediate side effects and we are uncertain whether etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the occurrence of these (very low‐certainty of evidence) and also conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference in side effects (low‐quality evidence). Given that all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers, we considered the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of evidence for the benefits or risks of the different treatments for both stuttering and fulminant priapism in sickle cell disease. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in sickle cell disease.","Treatments for long‐lasting and painful erection of the penis in boys and men with sickle cell disease Review question What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease? Background Priapism (the prolonged painful erection of the penis) is common in males with sickle cell disease. The length of time priapism lasts differs for different types and so does the medical treatment for it. Self‐management approaches may be helpful. We looked for randomised controlled trials of different treatments to find the best option. Search date We last looked for evidence on 09 September 2019. Study characteristics We found three trials set in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK involving 102 people. Key results In the trials, four different drug treatments (stilboestrol, sildenafil, ephedrine and etilefrine) were compared to placebo. The trials all looked at whether the treatments reduced how often attacks of priapism occurred. There was no difference between any of the treatments compared to placebo. Due to lack of high‐quality evidence, we are not able to conclude the best treatment of priapism in sickle cell disease. More research is needed. This is an update of a previously published review. Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of evidence to be low to very low as all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers.",CD004198
"Background Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, a group of at least 18 closely‐related species of gram‐negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia.  Burkholderia cepacia complex  bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentally‐acquired strains. Although evidence‐based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  these cannot be extended to  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 May 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex.","Which antibiotics are best to treat worsening symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection? Review question We looked for evidence of which antibiotics are best to treat a flare up of symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection. Background Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited condition where the lungs often become blocked with mucus. This harms the lungs' defences and often results in chronic, persistent infections that cannot be cleared by antibiotics. People with cystic fibrosis often need courses of antibiotics to reduce their symptoms (for instance cough, excess mucus and breathlessness) when these flare up or worsen. Such episodes are called exacerbations, and are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics (given through a drip into a vein). One group of bacteria that can infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis is called the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. These closely‐related bacteria are found widely in the environment and do not cause infections in healthy people who do not have cystic fibrosis. They are particularly hard to treat as they are resistant to many commonly‐used antibiotics. Currently doctors do not know which antibiotics are best at treating these infections; which combinations of antibiotics should be used; how long the antibiotics should be used for; or whether there are additional treatments that might also help. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 May 2019. Study characteristics We did not find any trials in people with exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria, where they were given different treatments at random. Key results More research is needed to find out which treatments are best for improving lung function and survival and for reducing side effects and length of time spent in hospital for people infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria experiencing an exacerbation.",CD009529
"Background A glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour for which the standard of care is maximum surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy, when possible. Age is an important consideration in this disease, as older age is associated with shorter survival and a higher risk of treatment‐related toxicity. Objectives To determine the most effective and best‐tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost‐effectiveness associated with these approaches. Search methods We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to 3 April 2019, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to database closure. We handsearched clinical trial registries and selected neuro‐oncology society conference proceedings from the past five years. Selection criteria Randomised trials (RCTs) of treatments for glioblastoma in elderly people. We defined ‘elderly' as 70+ years but included studies defining ‘elderly' as over 65+ years if so reported. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods for study selection and data extraction. Where sufficient data were available, treatment options were compared in a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using Stata software (version 15.1). For outcomes with insufficient data for NMA, pairwise meta‐analysis were conducted in RevMan. The GRADE approach was used to grade the evidence. Main results We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 1818 participants. Six were conducted exclusively among elderly people (either defined as 65 years or older or 70 years or older) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the other six reported data for an elderly subgroup among a broader age range of participants. Most participants were capable of self‐care. Study quality was commonly undermined by lack of outcome assessor blinding and attrition. NMA was only possible for overall survival; other analyses were pair‐wise meta‐analyses or narrative syntheses. Seven trials contributed to the NMA for overall survival, with interventions including supportive care only (one trial arm); hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT40; four trial arms); standard radiotherapy (RT60; five trial arms); temozolomide (TMZ; three trial arms); chemoradiotherapy (CRT; three trial arms); bevacizumab with chemoradiotherapy (BEV_CRT; one trial arm); and bevacizumab with radiotherapy (BEV_RT). Compared with supportive care only, NMA evidence suggested that all treatments apart from BEV_RT prolonged survival to some extent. Overall survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with RT40 (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.80) and low‐certainty evidence suggests that CRT may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ (TMZ versus CRT: HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.98). Low‐certainty evidence also suggests that adding BEV to CRT may make little or no difference (BEV_CRT versus CRT: HR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.48 to 1.44). We could not compare the survival effects of CRT with different radiotherapy fractionation schedules (60 Gy/30 fractions and 40 Gy/15 fractions) due to a lack of data. When treatments were ranked according to their effects on OS, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. BEV plus RT was the only treatment for which there was no clear benefit in OS over supportive care only.   One trial comparing tumour treating fields (TTF) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (TTF_AC) with adjuvant chemotherapy alone could not be included in the NMA as participants were randomised after receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy, not before. Findings from the trial suggest that the intervention probably improves overall survival in this selected patient population. We were unable to perform NMA for other outcomes due to insufficient data. Pairwise analyses were conducted for the following. Quality of life Moderate‐certainty narrative evidence suggests that overall, there may be little difference in QoL between TMZ and RT, except for discomfort from communication deficits, which are probably more common with RT (1 study, 306 participants, P = 0.002). Data on QoL for other comparisons were sparse, partly due to high dropout rates, and the certainty of the evidence tended to be low or very low. Progression‐free survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61); moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that RT60 probably increases time to disease progression compared with supportive care only (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.46), and that BEV_RT probably increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 alone (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78). Evidence for other treatment comparisons was of low‐ or very low‐certainty. Severe adverse events Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that TMZ probably increases the risk of grade 3+ thromboembolic events compared with RT60 (risk ratio (RR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.94; participants = 373; studies = 1) and also the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Moderate‐certainty evidence also suggests that CRT probably increases the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia compared with hypofractionated RT alone. Adding BEV to CRT probably increases the risk of thromboembolism (RR 16.63, 95% CI 1.00 to 275.42; moderate‐certainty evidence). Economic evidence There is a paucity of economic evidence regarding the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly. Only one economic evaluation on two short course radiotherapy regimen (25 Gy versus 40 Gy) was identified and its findings were considered unreliable. Authors' conclusions For elderly people with glioblastoma who are self‐caring, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with RT and may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ alone. For those undergoing RT or TMZ therapy, there is probably little difference in QoL overall. Systemic anti‐cancer treatments TMZ and BEV carry a higher risk of severe haematological and thromboembolic events and CRT is probably associated with a higher risk of these events. Current evidence provides little justification for using BEV in elderly patients outside a clinical trial setting. Whilst the novel TTF device appears promising, evidence on QoL and tolerability is needed in an elderly population. QoL and economic assessments of CRT versus TMZ and RT are needed. More high‐quality economic evaluations are needed, in which a broader scope of costs (both direct and indirect) and outcomes should be included.","Treatment options for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in older people What is the issue?   Glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour. The standard treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is to remove as much of the tumour as possible by operation, and then to give chemotherapy (an anti‐cancer medicine called temozolomide (TMZ)) and radiotherapy. TMZ is usually given at the same time as radiotherapy (concomitant chemotherapy), and also for about six months after radiotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy). Together, these treatments can be called chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, not all people, particularly the elderly, are fit enough to receive CRT, which can have serious side‐effects. In this review we evaluated evidence on different treatments that have been looked at in older people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, to find out which treatments may help. How we conducted the review   We searched for trials that compared different treatments in elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and also for studies on cost‐effectiveness. We defined 'the elderly' as 70+ years, but also included data from patients 65+ years old if studies did not give results for the 70+ age group. We used standard Cochrane methods to assess studies and collect data. We compared treatments in a network meta‐analysis (NMA), which allowed us to rank different treatments options. What we found   We found 12 studies evaluating different options including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive (palliative) care, combinations of treatments, and a medical device that is worn on the head and emits an electric field (known as tumour treating fields). Most people enrolled in these studies did not have serious disabilities. In the NMA, we compared the effects of seven treatments on patients overall survival. All treatments tested in the NMA apart from one, in which an agent called bevacizumab (BEV) was combined with radiotherapy, clearly prolonged survival compared with supportive care only. The strongest evidence we found showed that CRT leads to a longer survival time than short‐course radiotherapy only; but weaker evidence suggested that CRT also prolongs survival compared with TMZ only. When we ranked all treatments according to their effectiveness in prolonging survival time, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. A study of tumour treating fields could not be included in the NMA because it was conducted among fitter elderly patients who had already received part of their CRT. Evidence from this study suggested that adding tumour treating fields after radiotherapy probably improves survival in this fitter group of patients. With regard to quality of life, evidence suggested that the impact of TMZ and radiotherapy‐only treatments is probably not very different, except for greater discomfort from communication deficits with radiotherapy. Quality of life evidence was hard to interpret for other treatment options because it tended to be limited by high dropout rates, as people with glioblastoma do not live very long and may not feel like filling out questionnaires when they feel unwell. With regard to other outcomes, high‐certainty evidence showed that CRT delays disease progression compared with radiotherapy only. Evidence also suggested that adding BEV to short‐course radiotherapy probably delays disease progression, but may not improve overall survival. TMZ and BEV are more toxic to blood cells than radiotherapy and are associated with an increased risk of blood clots and blood vessel blockages (thromboembolism). Our conclusions   For reasonably fit elderly people with glioblastoma, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with radiotherapy or TMZ alone, and that any of these three treatment options may prolong survival compared with supportive care only. Serious adverse events affecting blood components are more common with anti‐cancer medicines TMZ and BEV. There is not enough evidence on BEV to support its use in elderly people with glioblastoma outside of a research setting. More evidence is needed on how different treatments impact quality of life and health costs. Age alone is unlikely to be the best determinant of optimal treatment of older people with glioblastoma.",CD013261
"Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease is the symptomatic predementia phase of Alzheimer's disease dementia, characterised by cognitive and functional impairment not severe enough to fulfil the criteria for dementia. In clinical samples, people with amnestic MCI are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia, with annual rates of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease estimated at approximately 10% to 15% compared with the base incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease dementia of 1% to 2% per year. Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI versus the clinical follow‐up diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia as a reference standard (delayed verification). To investigate sources of heterogeneity in accuracy, such as the use of qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements, including manual or automatic (MRI) techniques, or the length of follow‐up, and age of participants. MRI was evaluated as an add‐on test in addition to clinical diagnosis of MCI to improve early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. Search methods On 29 January 2019 we searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement's Specialised Register and the databases, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO, and LILACS. We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies identified by the electronic searches. Selection criteria We considered cohort studies of any size that included prospectively recruited people of any age with a diagnosis of MCI. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of baseline structural MRI versus the clinical follow‐up diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia (delayed verification). We did not exclude studies on the basis of length of follow‐up. We included studies that used either qualitative visual assessment or quantitative volumetric measurements of MRI to detect atrophy in the whole brain or in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, entorhinal cortex, medial temporal gyrus, lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, and cortical grey matter. Data collection and analysis Four teams of two review authors each independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search strategy. Two teams of two review authors each independently assessed the selected full‐text articles for eligibility, extracted data and solved disagreements by consensus. Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to fit summary ROC curves and to obtain overall measures of relative accuracy in subgroup analyses. We also used these models to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Main results We included 33 studies, published from 1999 to 2019, with 3935 participants of whom 1341 (34%) progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 2594 (66%) did not. Of the participants who did not progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia, 2561 (99%) remained stable MCI and 33 (1%) progressed to other types of dementia. The median proportion of women was 53% and the mean age of participants ranged from 63 to 87 years (median 73 years). The mean length of clinical follow‐up ranged from 1 to 7.6 years (median 2 years). Most studies were of poor methodological quality due to risk of bias for participant selection or the index test, or both. Most of the included studies reported data on the volume of the total hippocampus (pooled mean sensitivity 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.80); pooled mean specificity 0.71 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.77); 22 studies, 2209 participants). This evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and inconsistency. Seven studies reported data on the atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (mean sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73); mean specificity 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.76); 1077 participants) and five studies on the volume of the lateral ventricles (mean sensitivity 0.57 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.65); mean specificity 0.64 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.70); 1077 participants). This evidence was of moderate certainty due to risk of bias. Four studies with 529 participants analysed the volume of the total entorhinal cortex and four studies with 424 participants analysed the volume of the whole brain. We did not estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the volume of these two regions because available data were sparse and heterogeneous. We could not statistically evaluate the volumes of the lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, or cortical grey matter assessed in small individual studies. We found no evidence of a difference between studies in the accuracy of the total hippocampal volume with regards to duration of follow‐up or age of participants, but the manual MRI technique was superior to automatic techniques in mixed (mostly indirect) comparisons. We did not assess the relative accuracy of the volumes of different brain regions measured by MRI because only indirect comparisons were available, studies were heterogeneous, and the overall accuracy of all regions was moderate. Authors' conclusions The volume of hippocampus or medial temporal lobe, the most studied brain regions, showed low sensitivity and specificity and did not qualify structural MRI as a stand‐alone add‐on test for an early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. This is consistent with international guidelines, which recommend imaging to exclude non‐degenerative or surgical causes of cognitive impairment and not to diagnose dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future research should not focus on a single biomarker, but rather on combinations of biomarkers to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia.","How accurate is magnetic resonance imaging for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment? Why is improving Alzheimer ' s disease diagnosis important? Cognitive impairment is when people have problems remembering, learning, concentrating and making decisions. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) generally have more memory problems than other people of their age, but these problems are not severe enough to be classified as dementia. Studies have shown that people with MCI and loss of memory are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease dementia (approximately 10% to 15% of cases per year) than people without MCI (1% to 2% per year). Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease dementia is to follow people with MCI and assess cognitive changes over the years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may detect changes in the brain structures that indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease is important because people with MCI could benefit from early treatment to prevent or delay cognitive decline. What was the aim of this review? To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI. What was studied in the review? The volume of several brain regions was measured with MRI. Most studies (22 studies, 2209 participants) measured the volume of the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is associated primarily with memory. What are the main results in this review? Thirty‐three studies were eligible, in which 3935 participants with MCI were included and followed up for two or three years to see if they developed Alzheimer's disease dementia. About a third of them converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia, and the others did not or developed other types of dementia. We found that MRI is not accurate enough to identify people with MCI who will develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The correct prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be missed in 81 out of 300 people with MCI (false negatives) and a wrong prediction of Alzheimer's disease would be made in 203 out of 700 people with MCI (false positives). As a result, people with a false‐negative diagnosis would be falsely reassured and would not prepare themselves to cope with Alzheimer's disease, while those with a false‐positive diagnosis would suffer from the wrongly anticipated diagnosis. How reliable are the results of the studies? The included studies diagnosed Alzheimer's disease dementia by assessing all participants with standard clinical criteria after two or three years' follow‐up. We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted, since the participants were mainly selected from clinical registries and referral centres, and we also had concerns about how studies interpreted MRI. Moreover, the studies were conducted differently from each other, and they used different methods to select people with MCI and perform MRI. Who do the results of this review apply to? The results do not apply to people with MCI in the community, but only to people with MCI who attend memory clinics or referral centres. What are the implications of this review? MRI, as a single test, is not accurate for the early diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in people with MCI since one in three or four participants received a wrong diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Future research should not focus on a single test (such as MRI), but rather on combinations of tests to improve an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. How up to date is this review? This evidence is up to date to 29 January 2019.",CD009628
"Background Subfertility is a condition found in up to 15% of couples of reproductive age. Gamete micromanipulation, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is very useful for treating couples with compromised sperm parameters. An alternative method of sperm selection has been described; the spermatozoa are selected under high magnification (over 6000x) and used for ICSI. This technique, named intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI), has a theoretical potential to improve reproductive outcomes among couples undergoing assisted reproduction techniques (ART). However, our previous version of this Cochrane Review was unable to find evidence that supported this possible beneficial effect. This is an update of Teixeira 2013. Objectives To identify, appraise, and summarise the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety of IMSI compared to ICSI in couples undergoing ART. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in these electronic databases: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and in these trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also handsearched the reference lists of included studies and similar reviews. We performed the last electronic search on 18 November 2019. Selection criteria We only considered RCTs that compared ICSI and IMSI; we did not include quasi‐randomised trials. We considered studies that permitted the inclusion of the same participant more than once (cross‐over or per cycle trials) only if data regarding the first treatment of each participant were available. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias and quality of the evidence; we solved disagreements by consulting a third review author. We corresponded with study investigators to resolve any queries, as required. Main results The updated search retrieved 535 records; we included 13 parallel‐designed RCTs comparing IMSI and ICSI (four studies were added since the previous version), comprising 2775 couples (IMSI = 1256; ICSI = 1519). We are uncertain if IMSI improves live birth rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.39; 5 studies, 929 couples; I² = 1%), miscarriage rates per couple (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.48; 10 studies, 2297 couples; I² = 0%, very‐low quality evidence), and miscarriage rate per pregnancy (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; 10 studies, 783 couples; I² = 0%, very‐low quality evidence). We are uncertain if IMSI improves clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; 13 studies, 2775 couples; I² = 47%, very‐low quality evidence). None of the included studies reported congenital abnormalities. We judged the evidence for all outcomes to be of very low‐quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to limitations of the included studies (risk of bias), inconsistency of results, and a strong indication of publication bias. Authors' conclusions The current evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support or refute the clinical use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI). We are very uncertain of the chances of having a live birth and of the risk of having a miscarriage. We found very low‐quality evidence that IMSI may increase chances of a clinical pregnancy, which means that we are still very uncertain about any real difference. We did not find any trials reporting on the risk of congenital abnormalities. Well‐designed and sufficiently powered trials are still required.","Regular (ICSI) versus ultra‐high magnification (IMSI) sperm selection for assisted reproduction Background : Sperm micromanipulation, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is very useful for treating couples in which the male partner has reduced sperm concentration, motility, or both. In the past decade, a different approach for sperm selection has been described, which analyses sperm under ultra‐high powered magnification (6000x). Initial studies showed that intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI), using sperm selected under high magnification, was associated with higher pregnancy rates than those selected with conventional ICSI in couples with repeated implantation failures. However, the evidence from our previous Cochrane Review was uncertain of the real beneficial effects of this intervention. Search date : We updated our search of the medical literature in November 2019, looking for studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of IMSI (using 6000x magnification) compared to conventional ICSI (using 200x to 400x magnification) procedures. Study characteristics : We found 13 randomised controlled trials (four more than in the previous version), evaluating 2775 couples, that compared regular ICSI with IMSI for assisted reproduction. These studies were funded by fertility centres and universities. Key results : Based on the very low‐quality evidence that we found, we are uncertain of the benefit of IMSI over ICSI. The chance of having a live birth with IMSI was between 20% and 32%, compared to 25% with ICSI. For women with a 7% risk of miscarriage with regular ICSI, the risk with IMSI was between 5% and 10%. The clinical pregnancy rate with IMSI was between 35% and 44%, compared with 32% with ICSI. Quality of the evidence:  We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of limitations in the included studies (risk of bias), inconsistency of the observed effect across studies, and high risk of publication bias. There was no evidence concerning congenital abnormalities. We conclude that the current evidence is very limited for suggesting using IMSI instead of ICSI in clinical practice.",CD010167
"Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma or other extrahepatic primary cancers. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and the reported long‐term survival rate after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients; therefore, other treatments have to be considered. One of these is percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells, accompanied by small‐vessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction of the tumour. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 September 2019: the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; Science Citation Index Expanded; Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17 September 2019) . Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection and its comparators (no intervention, other ablation methods, systemic treatments) for liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures as outlined by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, and trial methods. Two review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using GRADE. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We identified only one randomised clinical trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) in addition to transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone. The trial was conducted in China and included 48 trial participants with liver metastases: 25 received PEI plus TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. The trial included 37 male and 11 female participants. Mean participant age was 49.3 years. Sites of primary tumours included colon (27 cases), stomach (12 cases), pancreas (3 cases), lung (3 cases), breast (2 cases), and ovary (1 case). Seven participants had a single tumour, 15 had two tumours, and 26 had three or more tumours in the liver. The bulk diameter of the tumour on average was 3.9 cm, ranging from 1.2 cm to 7.6 cm. Participants were followed for 10 months to 43 months. The trial reported survival data after one, two, and three years. In the PEI + TACE group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of participants survived after one year, two years, and three years; in the TACE alone group, these percentages were 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. Upon conversion of these data to mortality rates, the calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality at last follow‐up when PEI plus TACE was compared with TACE alone was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.33; very low‐certainty evidence) after three years of follow‐up. Local recurrence was 16% in the PEI plus TACE group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in an RR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.15; very low‐certainty evidence). Forty‐five out of a total of 68 tumours (66.2%) shrunk by at least 25% in the PEI plus TACE group versus 31 out of a total of 64 tumours (48.4%) in the TACE group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but provided very few details. We did not find data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. The single included trial did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effectiveness of PEI plus TACE versus TACE in people with liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on one small randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias. Currently, it cannot be determined whether adding PEI to TACE makes a difference in comparison to using TACE alone. Evidence for benefits or harms of PEI compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments is lacking.","Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases Is local destruction of the cancer that spread to the liver with percutaneous ethanol injection beneficial? Review question What is the effect of using percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to destroy any cancer metastases in the liver? Metastases are new cancer sites that are found in parts of the body other than the site of the original cancer. We were looking for any randomised trial (a study in which patients are allocated to groups by a play of chance) assessing effects of PEI in people with metastases in the liver from cancer of any location compared with no PEI with or without co‐interventions. We looked at effects of PEI on risk of death, progression of disease, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention). Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites of metastasis is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die of complications. Metastases in the liver can be destroyed by several different methods, one of them being PEI. This procedure is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance; a special needle is placed at the cancer site and is subsequently used to inject alcohol with the goal of killing cancer tissues. Ultrasound and computed tomography are imaging procedures. Alcohol induces tumour destruction by drawing water out of tumour cells (dehydrating them), thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of the cellular proteins. Search results and study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 10 September 2019. We included only one randomised trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a liver‐directed treatment whereby chemotherapy is administered through the catheter directly to blood vessels supplying the tumour) to TACE alone. Forty‐eight people with liver metastases were included; 25 received PEI with TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. Primary tumours were colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, and ovary cancers. The included study did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Key results Results of one small randomised clinical trial do not show beneficial or harmful effects of adding percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection to TACE in people with liver metastases with respect to mortality or local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone. Participants were followed for between 10 and 43 months. The tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but gave very few details. We found no data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty because the identified study was at high risk of bias, had a relatively small sample size, described few events overall, and reported inconclusive results.",CD008717
"Background Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia. Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of ESAs, between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm or low birth weight infants. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 5 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 June 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of late initiation of EPO treatment (started at ≥ eight days of age) versus placebo or no intervention in preterm (< 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) neonates. Data collection and analysis We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We include 31 studies (32 comparisons) randomising 1651 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2018 identified one new study for inclusion. No new on‐going trials were identified and no studies used darbepoetin. Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta‐analysis showed a significant effect on the use of one or more RBC transfusions (21 studies (n = 1202); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.22 to ‐0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 66%; RD I² = 58%). The quality of the evidence was very low. We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant (typical mean difference (MD) ‐1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI ‐5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%). Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). The quality of the evidence was very low.Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.10). There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). The quality of the evidence was very low.There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes including mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. For the outcomes of mortality and necrotising enterocolitis, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. Authors' conclusions Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (mL/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment, to prevent donor exposure, is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.","Late erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents to prevent red blood cell transfusion in preterm or low birth weight infants Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents treatment between eight and 28 days after birth, for reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm or low birth weight infants. Background The percentage of circulating red blood cells (haematocrit) falls after birth in all infants. This is particularly true in preterm infants due to their poor response to anaemia and to the amount of blood that is drawn for necessary testing. Low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production in preterm infants, provide a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (EPO and darbepoetin) to prevent or treat anaemia. Search date The evidence is current to 5 June 2018. Study characteristics To date, 1651 infants (between eight and 28 days of age) born preterm have been enrolled in 31 studies of late administration of EPO to reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions and to prevent donor exposure. There were no studies that used darbepoetin. Study funding sources We have not received any funding for this review and we have no conflicts of interest to declare. Key results The risk of receiving red blood transfusion is reduced following initiation of EPO treatment. However, the overall benefit of EPO is reduced as many of these infants had been exposed to donor blood prior to entry into the trials. Treatment with late EPO did not have any important effects on death or common complications of preterm birth, except for trends towards an increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease of the eye affecting infants born preterm. It is thought to be caused by disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels, which may result in scarring and retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases. Quality of the evidence The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing. Sample sizes were small and long‐term outcomes (18 to 24 months of corrected age) were not reported. The quality of the evidence was very low for the outcomes of ""use of one or more red blood cell transfusions,"" ""retinopathy of prematurity (all stages or stage not reported)"" and for ""retinopathy of prematurity (stage ≥ 3)"". For the outcomes of ""necrotising enterocolitis"" and ""mortality"", the quality of the evidence was moderate.",CD004868
"Background Liver transplantation is considered the definitive treatment for people with liver failure. As part of post‐liver transplantation management, immunosuppression (suppressing the host immunity) is given to prevent graft rejections. Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into those that are used for a short period during the beginning phase of immunosuppression (induction immunosuppression) and those that are used over the entire lifetime of the individual (maintenance immunosuppression), because it is widely believed that graft rejections are more common during the first few months after liver transplantation. Some drugs such as glucocorticosteroids may be used for both induction and maintenance immunosuppression because of their multiple modalities of action. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether induction immunosuppression is necessary and if so, the relative efficacy of different immunosuppressive agents. Objectives To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different induction immunosuppressive regimens in adults undergoing liver transplantation through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the different induction immunosuppressive regimens according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until July 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in adults undergoing liver transplantation. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults undergoing liver transplantation. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had multivisceral transplantation and those who already had graft rejections. Data collection and analysis We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included a total of 25 trials (3271 participants; 8 treatments) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (3017 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people undergoing primary liver transplantation for various indications and excluded those with HIV and those with renal impairment. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from three to 76 months, with a median follow‐up of 12 months among trials. All except one trial were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Overall, approximately 7.4% of people who received the standard regimen of glucocorticosteroid induction died and 12.2% developed graft failure. All‐cause mortality and graft failure was lower with basiliximab compared with glucocorticosteroid induction: all‐cause mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CrI 0.31 to 0.93; network estimate, based on 2 direct comparison trials (131 participants; low‐certainty evidence)); and graft failure (HR 0.44, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.70; direct estimate, based on 1 trial (47 participants; low‐certainty evidence)). There was no evidence of differences in all‐cause mortality and graft failure between other induction immunosuppressants and glucocorticosteroids in either the direct comparison or the network meta‐analysis (very low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of differences in serious adverse events (proportion), serious adverse events (number), renal failure, any adverse events (proportion), any adverse events (number), liver retransplantation, graft rejections (any), or graft rejections (requiring treatment) between other induction immunosuppressants and glucocorticosteroids in either the direct comparison or the network meta‐analysis (very low‐certainty evidence). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the studies reported health‐related quality of life. Funding: the source of funding for 14 trials was drug companies who would benefit from the results of the study; two trials were funded by neutral organisations who have no vested interests in the results of the study; and the source of funding for the remaining nine trials was unclear. Authors' conclusions Based on low‐certainty evidence, basiliximab induction may decrease mortality and graft failure compared to glucocorticosteroids induction in people undergoing liver transplantation. However, there is considerable uncertainty about this finding because this information is based on small trials at high risk of bias. The evidence is uncertain about the effects of different induction immunosuppressants on other clinical outcomes, including graft rejections. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts (or perform intention‐to‐treat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, and health‐related quality of life.","Medical interventions to prevent early graft rejection after liver transplantation What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? Liver transplantation is the main treatment option for people with severe advanced liver disease. When organs or tissues are transplanted from one person (organ donor) to another (organ recipient), the body of the organ recipient identifies the donor organ (or graft) as a foreign body and initiates a response against it in a way similar to the natural body defence mechanism against infections (immune response). This can sometimes lead to rejection or failure of the donor liver, which can result in the death of the organ recipient. Various medical interventions (immunosuppressive regimen) are used either alone or in combination to prevent rejection. The combination of interventions used in the first few months after liver transplantation (induction immunosuppressive regimen) is often different from the combination used for the rest of the patient's life (maintenance immunosuppression). It is unclear which induction immunosuppressive regimen after liver transplantation is the most effective. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant research studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised clinical trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments simultaneously (usually referred to as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). Date of literature search   July 2019 Key messages   Only one of the 25 studies was conducted without flaws and most of the studies were small in terms of the number of participants included. Because of this, there is high or very high uncertainty in the obtained analysis results in this review. Overall, a drug called basiliximab may halve the number of deaths and graft failures in people who have had a liver transplant compared to the standard induction immunosuppressive regimen of glucocorticoids. The funding source was unclear in nine studies. Commercial organisations funded 14 of the studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining two trials. What was studied in the review? This review studied adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, who underwent liver transplantation for various reasons. Participants were given different induction immunosuppressive agents or no induction immunosuppressive agents. The review authors excluded studies in people who underwent other organ transplants (such as kidney transplant) in addition to the liver, and studies in which people had already developed graft rejection. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 48 years to 62 years. The administered induction immunosuppressive groups included glucocorticosteroids, anti‐thymocyte globulin, basiliximab, or dacluzimab either alone or in combination with glucocorticosteroids. The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, graft failure, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, kidney failure, time to liver retransplantation, and graft rejections. What were the main results of the review? The 25 studies included a small number of participants in total (3271 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 3017 participants altogether provided data for analyses. The follow‐up of participants in the trials ranged from three to 76 months: the average follow‐up in the trials was 12 months. The review shows that:  ‐ seven out of every 100 people died and 12 out of every 100 people developed graft failure;  ‐ compared with the standard induction immunosuppression of glucocorticosteroids, basiliximab may halve the number of deaths and graft failure; however this information is based on small studies with flaws. Therefore, there is a lot of uncertainty about the effect of basiliximab;  ‐ the evidence is uncertain about the effects of different induction immunosuppressants on other clinical outcomes, including graft rejections;  ‐ none of the trials reported health‐related quality of life;  ‐ future well‐designed trials are needed.",CD013203
"Background Poor diet and insufficient physical activity are major risk factors for non‐communicable diseases. Developing healthy diet and physical activity behaviors early in life is important as these behaviors track between childhood and adulthood. Parents and other adult caregivers have important influences on children's health behaviors, but whether their involvement in children's nutrition and physical activity interventions contributes to intervention effectiveness is not known. Objectives • To assess effects of caregiver involvement in interventions for improving children's dietary intake and physical activity behaviors, including those intended to prevent overweight and obesity • To describe intervention content and behavior change techniques employed, drawing from a behavior change technique taxonomy developed and advanced by Abraham, Michie, and colleagues (Abraham 2008; Michie 2011; Michie 2013; Michie 2015) • To identify content and techniques related to reported outcomes when such information was reported in included studies Search methods In January 2019, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 11 other databases, and three trials registers. We also searched the references lists of relevant reports and systematic reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating the effects of interventions to improve children's dietary intake or physical activity behavior, or both, with children aged 2 to 18 years as active participants and at least one component involving caregivers versus the same interventions but without the caregiver component(s). We excluded interventions meant as treatment or targeting children with pre‐existing conditions, as well as caregiver‐child units residing in orphanages and school hostel environments. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures outlined by Cochrane. Main results We included 23 trials with approximately 12,192 children in eligible intervention arms. With the exception of two studies, all were conducted in high‐income countries, with more than half performed in North America. Most studies were school‐based and involved the addition of healthy eating or physical education classes, or both, sometimes in tandem with other changes to the school environment. The specific intervention strategies used were not always reported completely. However, based on available reports, the behavior change techniques used most commonly in the child‐only arm were ""shaping knowledge,"" ""comparison of behavior,"" ""feedback and monitoring,"" and ""repetition and substitution."" In the child + caregiver arm, the strategies used most commonly included additional ""shaping knowledge"" or ""feedback and monitoring"" techniques, as well as ""social support"" and ""natural consequences."" We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias for at least one design factor. Seven trials did not contribute any data to analyses. The quality of reporting of intervention content varied between studies, and there was limited scope for meta‐analysis. Both validated and non‐validated instruments were used to measure outcomes of interest. Outcomes measured and reported differed between studies, with 16 studies contributing data to the meta‐analyses. About three‐quarters of studies reported their funding sources; no studies reported industry funding. We assessed the quality of evidence to be low or very low. Dietary behavior change interventions with a caregiver component versus interventions without a caregiver component Seven studies compared dietary behavior change interventions with and without a caregiver component. At the end of the intervention, we did not detect a difference between intervention arms in children's percentage of total energy intake from saturated fat (mean difference [MD] −0.42%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.25 to 0.41, 1 study, n = 207; low‐quality evidence) or from sodium intake (MD −0.12 g/d, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.12, 1 study, n = 207; low‐quality evidence). No trial in this comparison reported data for children's combined fruit and vegetable intake, sugar‐sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, or physical activity levels, nor for adverse effects of interventions. Physical activity interventions with a caregiver component versus interventions without a caregiver component Six studies compared physical activity interventions with and without a caregiver component. At the end of the intervention, we did not detect a difference between intervention arms in children's total physical activity (MD 0.20 min/h, 95% CI −1.19 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 54; low‐quality evidence) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.04, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.49, 2 studies, n = 80; moderate‐quality evidence). No trial in this comparison reported data for percentage of children's total energy intake from saturated fat, sodium intake, fruit and vegetable intake, or SSB intake, nor for adverse effects of interventions. Combined dietary and physical activity interventions with a caregiver component versus interventions without a caregiver component Ten studies compared dietary and physical activity interventions with and without a caregiver component. At the end of the intervention, we detected a small positive impact of a caregiver component on children's SSB intake (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.44 to −0.12, 3 studies, n = 651; moderate‐quality evidence). We did not detect a difference between intervention arms in children's percentage of total energy intake from saturated fat (MD 0.06%, 95% CI −0.67 to 0.80, 2 studies, n = 216; very low‐quality evidence), sodium intake (MD 35.94 mg/d, 95% CI −322.60 to 394.47, 2 studies, n = 315; very low‐quality evidence), fruit and vegetable intake (MD 0.38 servings/d, 95% CI −0.51 to 1.27, 1 study, n = 134; very low‐quality evidence), total physical activity (MD 1.81 min/d, 95% CI −15.18 to 18.80, 2 studies, n = 573; low‐quality evidence), or MVPA (MD −0.05 min/d, 95% CI −18.57 to 18.47, 1 study, n = 622; very low‐quality evidence). One trial indicated that no adverse events were reported by study participants but did not provide data. Authors' conclusions Current evidence is insufficient to support the inclusion of caregiver involvement in interventions to improve children's dietary intake or physical activity behavior, or both. For most outcomes, the quality of the evidence is adversely impacted by the small number of studies with available data, limited effective sample sizes, risk of bias, and imprecision. To establish the value of caregiver involvement, additional studies measuring clinically important outcomes using valid and reliable measures, employing appropriate design and power, and following established reporting guidelines are needed, as is evidence on how such interventions might contribute to health equity.","Effects of involving parents and other adult caregivers in children's diet and physical activity interventions Review question Does it make a difference if parents or other adult caregivers are involved in interventions to encourage children to eat healthier or be more physically active? Background Diet and physical activity behaviors are important determinants of health. Parents and other adult caregivers have an essential role in shaping children's health habits by controlling availability of and access to healthy foods and opportunities to be active; supporting, encouraging, and role‐modeling healthy behaviors; and adopting supportive feeding styles and practices. For these reasons, it often is argued that parent and caregiver involvement in children's diet and physical activity interventions is important; however, it remains unclear if involvement of parents and caregivers actually provides benefit. Objectives We assessed the effects of involving parents or other adult caregivers in children's healthy eating and physical activity interventions compared to the effects of the same child interventions without a parent or caregiver component. We were particularly interested in understanding effects on children's dietary intake, children's physical activity levels, and adverse effects of interventions. Study characteristics We found 23 studies, published between 1982 and 2019, that implemented diet interventions, physical activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions with children or adolescents, and evaluated the effects of adding an intervention component involving parents or other adult caregivers. Approximately 12,192 children aged 2 to 18 years were examined. More than half of studies took place in North America, and all but two were conducted in high‐income countries. Most studies were school‐based and involved the addition of healthy eating or physical education classes, or both, sometimes in tandem with other changes to the school environment. The breadth of information provided about intervention content varied between studies. The most commonly used intervention techniques were those aimed at shaping participants' knowledge, such as providing instruction about how to perform a behavior (e.g. dance, cooking lessons). About three‐quarters of studies reported their funding source; no studies reported industry funding. Key results The findings of this review suggest that adding a parent or caregiver component to dietary behavior change interventions or physical activity interventions may make little or no difference to children's dietary intake or physical activity levels. For interventions that target both diet and physical activity behaviors, involving a parent or caregiver probably slightly reduces children's sugar‐sweetened beverage intake by the end of the intervention. We do not know whether any of these types of interventions result in adverse effects because these data are not available. Quality of evidence Overall, the evidence from studies is of low or very low quality, which means that we are uncertain about study results. Currentness of evidence The evidence is current to January 2019.",CD012547
"Background It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. Objectives To examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  Selection criteria We included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  Data collection and analysis Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  Main results Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence.","Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines Background Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. The evidence is current to 14 December 2018. Key results and certainty of the evidence We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual.",CD013299
"Background Poliomyelitis is a debilitating and deadly infection. Despite exponential growth in medical science, there is still no cure for the disease, which is caused by three types of wild polioviruses: types 1, 2, and 3. According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), wild poliovirus is still in circulation in three countries, and fresh cases have been reported even in the year 2018. Due to the administration of live vaccines, the risk for vaccine‐derived poliovirus (VDPV) is high in areas that are free from wild polioviruses. This is evident based on the fact that VDPV caused 20 outbreaks between 2000 and 2011. Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization favoured the inclusion of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the global immunisation schedule. IPV can be delivered in two ways: intramuscularly and intradermally. IPV was previously administered intramuscularly, but shortages in vaccine supplies, coupled with the higher costs of the vaccines, led to the innovation of delivering a fractional dose (one‐fifth) of IPV intradermally. However, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an intradermal, fractional dose of IPV compared to an intramuscular, full dose of IPV. Objectives To compare the immunogenicity and efficacy of an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in equivalent immunisation schedules using fractional‐dose IPV given via the intradermal route versus full‐dose IPV given via the intramuscular route. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 10 other databases, and two trial registers up to February 2019. We also searched the GPEI website and scanned the bibliographies of key studies and reviews in order to identify any additional published and unpublished trials in this area not captured by our electronic searches. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of healthy individuals of any age who are eligible for immunisation with IPV, comparing intradermal fractional‐dose (one‐fifth) IPV to intramuscular full‐dose IPV. Data collection and analysis   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 13 RCTs involving a total of 7292 participants, both children (n = 6402) and adults (n = 890). Nine studies were conducted in middle‐income countries, three studies in high‐income countries, and only one study in a low‐income country. Five studies did not report methods of randomisation, and one study failed to conceal the allocations. Eleven studies did not blind participants, and six studies did not blind outcome assessments. Two studies had high attrition rates, and one study selectively reported the results. Three studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Paralytic poliomyelitis.  No study reported data on this outcome. Seroconversion rates.  These were significantly higher for all three types of wild poliovirus for children given intramuscular full‐dose IPV after a single primary dose and two primary doses, but only significantly higher for type two wild poliovirus given intramuscularly after three primary doses:  • dose one (six studies): poliovirus type 1 (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.41; 2570 children); poliovirus type 2 (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.60; 2567 children); poliovirus type 3 (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.30; 2571 children);  • dose two (three studies): poliovirus type 1 (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33; 981 children); poliovirus type 2 (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60; 853 children); and poliovirus type 3 (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; 855 children); and  • dose three (three studies): poliovirus type 1 (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.15; 973 children); poliovirus type 2 (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.63; 973 children); and poliovirus type 3 (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.58; 973 children). Using the GRADE approach, we rated the certainty of the evidence as low or very low for seroconversion rate (after a single, two, or three primary doses) for all three poliovirus types due to significant risk of bias, heterogeneity, and indirectness in applicability/generalisability. Geometric mean titres.  No study reported mean antibody titres. Median antibody titres were higher for intramuscular full‐dose IPV (7 studies with 4887 children); although these studies also reported a rise in antibody titres in the intradermal group, none reported the duration for which the titres remained high. Any vaccine‐related adverse event.  Five studies (2217 children) reported more adverse events, such as fever and redness, in the intradermal group, whilst two studies (1904 children) reported more adverse events in the intramuscular group. Authors' conclusions There is low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence that intramuscular full‐dose IPV may result in a slight increase in seroconversion rates for all three types of wild poliovirus, compared with intradermal fractional‐dose IPV. We are uncertain whether intradermal fractional‐dose (one‐fifth) IPV has better protective effects and causes fewer adverse events in children than intramuscular full‐dose IPV.","Effectiveness of equivalent schedules of full‐dose inactivated poliovirus vaccine injected into muscle compared to a smaller dose injected into skin Background Polio is a disabling disease that is only preventable via vaccination. There are two types of polio vaccines: live poliovirus vaccine delivered orally (by mouth – so‐called OPV) and inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine (IPV). OPV is the mainstay of polio eradication but carries a risk of causing vaccine‐associated polio. This is not the case for IPV, which also has fewer side effects and can be given to people with low immunity, making it vital for the complete elimination of poliovirus. Killed vaccines can be given via injection either into the muscles (intramuscular) or into the skin (intradermal). Review question How effective is a small dose of IPV injected into the skin compared to a full dose of IPV injected into muscle in similar schedules? Study characteristics The database searches, up‐to‐date to February 2019, found 13 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). Three studies comprised 890 adult participants; a further 10 studies comprised 6402 infants and children. Nine studies were conducted in middle‐income countries; three studies in high‐income countries; and one study in a low‐income country. The studies had a duration of 2 to 19 months. Three studies were supported financially by drug companies, and three studies received the vaccines from the pharmaceutical company. There is overall limited confidence in the quality of the included studies since, for example, in most trials the recipient or assessor (or both) were aware of the vaccine being given. Key results The review included 13 studies with a total of 7292 participants (6402 children and 890 adults). Where possible, we combined the results of similar studies in a meta‐analysis (a statistical method of combining the results of multiple single studies to calculate an overall effect). There are three types of wild poliovirus: types 1, 2, and 3. We found that the number of antibody responses to the vaccine (measured using something called seroconversion rates) in children was higher in the group that received the vaccine by intramuscular injection compared to the group that had a similar number of injections given intradermally, after one single dose (6 studies, 2571 children) and two doses (3 studies, 981 children) for all three types of poliovirus, and after three doses for type 2 poliovirus (3 studies, 973 children). The vaccines produce antibodies against all three types of poliovirus. The quantity of antibodies produced by the vaccines (measured as geometric median titres) was higher in children receiving a full dose of IPV via intramuscular route for all three types of poliovirus (7 studies, 4887 children). Five studies (2217 children) reported more adverse events, such as fever and redness, in the intradermal group, whilst two studies (1904 children) reported more adverse events in the intramuscular group. None of the included studies reported data on the occurrence of paralytic poliomyelitis. Certainty of the evidence Based on the evidence, intramuscular full‐dose IPV may result in a slight increase in seroconversion rates for all three types of wild poliovirus when compared with intradermal fractional‐dose IPV. We are uncertain if a fractional dose of IPV given intradermally is better than a full dose of IPV given intramuscularly at producing antibodies for all three types of poliovirus or reducing adverse effects.",CD011780
"Background Sickle cell disease is the most common single gene disorder and the commonest haemoglobinopathy found with high prevalence in many populations across the world. Management of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease requires special consideration for three main reasons. Firstly, dental and oral tissues are affected by the blood disorder resulting in several oro‐facial abnormalities. Secondly, living with a haemoglobinopathy and coping with its associated serious consequences may result in individuals neglecting their oral health care. Finally, the treatment of these oral complications must be adapted to the systemic condition and special needs of these individuals, in order not to exacerbate or deteriorate their general health. Guidelines for the treatment of dental complications in this population who require special care are unclear and even unavailable in many aspects. Hence this review was undertaken to provide a basis for clinical care by investigating and analysing the existing evidence in the literature for the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess methods of treating dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 01 August 2019. Additionally, we searched nine online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean database, African Index Medicus, Index Medicus for South East Asia Region, Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Indexing of Indian Medical Journals). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted haematologists, experts in fields of dentistry, organizations, pharmaceutical companies and researchers working in this field. Date of last search: 07 November 2019. Selection criteria We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled studies of treatments for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors intended to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of the included studies using standard Cochrane methodologies; however, no studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Main results No randomised controlled studies were identified. Authors' conclusions This Cochrane Review did not identify any randomised controlled studies assessing interventions for the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. There is an important need for randomised controlled studies in this area, so as to identify the most effective and safe method for treating dental complications in people with sickle cell disease.","Treatment of dental complications in sickle cell disease Review question We planned to review the evidence regarding the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder which affects at least 5.2% of the world population across a large number of countries. In this condition, a genetic defect means that the haemoglobin in the red blood cells is not normal, instead the blood cells become sickle‐shaped and not a normal disc shape. These cells become trapped in blood vessels of various organs, especially during stressful events like a lack of oxygen, dehydration, extreme temperatures, stress, menstruation and infection. Blocked blood vessels lead to sudden episodes of severe pain in the short term and chronic organ damage in the long term. Sickle cell disease also leads to changes and complications in the mouth, jaw and facial areas. Management of these dental complications is often neglected as people with sickle cell disease focus all their energy on maintaining their general health due to the serious blood disorder. Neglecting minor dental health issues under these circumstances not only worsens the problem but may also cause a painful sickle‐cell crisis, leading to emergency hospital admissions. Treatment of oral complications in this group of people needs to be tailored around their blood disorder, in order not to cause any further deterioration to their general health. There is a lack of information on the appropriate treatment for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease,with no clear guidelines available. This often results in many people being refused treatment by dentists due to a fear of complications. Hence, we planned to investigate this issue and make any evidence in this area available to healthcare providers and people with the disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 August 2019. Study characteristics We were not able to find any randomised controlled studies assessing treatment for any dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Key results   No studies were identified, so we can not draw any conclusions or highlight any implications for practice. Studies are needed to establish the best treatment for dental problems in people with sickle cell disease.    Quality of the evidence There is no evidence from studies (where people are given one treatment or another completely at random) for any treatment for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease.",CD011633
"Background Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the abdominal cavity. Most women with advanced ovarian cancer and some women with advanced endometrial cancer need repeated drainage for ascites. Guidelines to advise those involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally not evidence‐based. Managing drains that improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure is key in making recommendations that could improve the quality of life (QoL) for women at this critical period of their lives. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of different interventions for the management of malignant ascites drainage in the palliative care of women with gynaecological cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 4 November 2019. We checked clinical trial registries, grey literature, reports of conferences, citation lists of included studies, and key textbooks for potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with malignant ascites with gynaecological cancer. If studies also included women with non‐gynaecological cancer, we planned to extract data specifically for women with gynaecological cancers or request the data from trial authors. If this was not possible, we planned to include the study only if at least 50% of participants were diagnosed with gynaecological cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, evaluated the quality of the included studies, compared results, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methodology. Main results In the original 2010 review, we identified no relevant studies. This updated review included one RCT involving 245 participants that compared abdominal paracentesis and intraperitoneal infusion of catumaxomab versus abdominal paracentesis alone. The study was at high risk of bias in almost all domains. The data were not suitable for analysis. The median time to the first deterioration of QoL ranged from 19 to 26 days in participants receiving paracentesis alone compared to 47 to 49 days among participants receiving paracentesis with catumaxomab infusion (very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events were only reported among participants receiving catumaxomab infusion. The most common severe adverse events were abdominal pain and lymphopenia (157 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on the improvement of symptoms, satisfaction of participants and caregivers, and cost‐effectiveness. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the most appropriate management of drainage for malignant ascites among women with gynaecological cancer, as there was only very low‐certainty evidence from one small RCT at overall high risk of bias.","Methods for the drainage of fluid containing cancer cells that collect in the abdomen in women with gynaecological cancer Background Malignant ascites is the build‐up of fluid within the abdominal cavity caused by underlying cancer. Women with advanced ovarian cancer and some women with advanced uterine cancer (also known as womb cancer) often need drainage for malignant ascites to alleviate discomfort. Guidelines to advise healthcare professionals involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally based on clinicians' experience. Study characteristics We searched for studies up to Novemeber 2019 that compared different ways of managing the drainage of fluid collected in the abdomen of women with gynaecological cancer (cancer that starts in a woman's reproductive organs). Key results and quality of evidence The original 2010 review found no relevant studies. This updated review included one randomised controlled trial (RCT: a type of study in which people are randomly assigned to receive different treatments) involving 245 women that compared drainage combined with catumaxomab (a medicine used to treatment malignant ascites) versus drainage alone. However, the results were insufficient to assess the difference between these treatments. Although women receiving drainage combined with catumaxomab had better quality of life (the general well‐being of a person) for longer compared to drainage alone, we are very unsure of this evidence due to the small number of participants and trials. There were some side effects in the drainage plus catumaxomab group (e.g. pain, low white blood cell count), but they were not well reported. At present, there is insufficient data regarding the best management of drainage for malignant ascites among women with gynaecological cancer. The evidence is current to 4 November 2019.",CD007794
"Background Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection, and occurs in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015. Objectives To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register,  ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) on 4 November 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening. Trials using a cluster‐RCT design and quasi‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross‐over studies were not. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 15 studies, involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 12 studies, 2017 women; low‐certainty evidence). Antibiotic treatment may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; 3 studies, 327 women; low‐certainty evidence), and low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; 6 studies, 1437 babies; low‐certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; 4 studies; 596 women), but the results were inconclusive for serious adverse neonatal outcomes (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.79, 3 studies; 549 babies). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes, and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias across all domains; the other 14 studies were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. Many studies lacked an adequate description of methods, and we could only judge the risk of bias as unclear, but in most studies, we assessed at least one domain at high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the three primary outcomes with GRADE software, and found low‐certainty evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g. Authors' conclusions Antibiotic treatment may be effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, but our confidence in the effect estimate is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. There may be a reduction in preterm birth and low birthweight with antibiotic treatment, consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but again, the confidence in the effect is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. Research implications identified in this review include the need for an up‐to‐date cost‐effectiveness evaluation of diagnostic algorithms, and more evidence to learn whether there is a low‐risk group of women who are unlikely to benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.","Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in pregnancy when there are no symptoms What is the issue? Can giving antibiotics to pregnant women who have a urinary infection but no symptoms improve the outcomes for women and their babies? Why is this important? A bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection (asymptomatic bacteriuria) occurs in a number (2% to 15%) of pregnancies. Because of the changes happening in their body, pregnant women are more likely to develop a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) if they have a urinary infection. The infection may also contribute to a baby who is born preterm (before 37 weeks), or at a low birthweight (weighs less than 2500 g (5.5 pounds)). What evidence did we find? We found 15 randomised controlled studies involving over 2000 pregnant women with urinary infections, but no symptoms. Antibiotics may be effective in reducing the incidence of kidney infection in the mother (12 studies, 2017 women) and clearing the infection from the urine (four studies, 596 women). They may also reduce the incidence of preterm births (three studies, 327 women) and low birthweight babies (six studies, 1437 babies). None of the studies adequately assessed any adverse effects of antibiotic treatment for the mother or her baby, and often the way the study was done was not well described. We assessed the three main outcomes with the GRADE approach, and found low‐certainty evidence that antibiotic treatment may prevent pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g. What does this mean? Antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of kidney infections in pregnant women who have a urine infection but show no symptoms of infection. Antibiotics may also reduce the chance a baby will be born too early or have a low birthweight. However, because of the low certainty of the evidence, it is difficult to draw conclusions; more research is needed.",CD000490
"Background Many survivors of stroke report attentional impairments, such as diminished concentration and distractibility. However, the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for improving these impairments is uncertain.This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2000 and previously updated in 2013. Objectives To determine whether people receiving cognitive rehabilitation for attention problems 1. show better outcomes in their attentional functions than those given no treatment or treatment as usual, and 2. have a better functional recovery, in terms of independence in activities of daily living, mood, and quality of life, than those given no treatment or treatment as usual. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycBITE, REHABDATA and ongoing trials registers up to February 2019. We screened reference lists and tracked citations using Scopus. Selection criteria We included controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive rehabilitation for impairments of attention for people with stroke. We did not consider listening to music, meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to be a form of cognitive rehabilitation. We only considered trials that selected people with demonstrable or self‐reported attentional deficits. The primary outcomes were measures of global attentional functions, and secondary outcomes were measures of attentional domains (i.e. alertness, selective attention, sustained attention, divided attention), functional abilities, mood, and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included no new trials in this update. The results are unchanged from the previous review and are based on the data of six RCTs with 223 participants. All six RCTs compared cognitive rehabilitation with a usual care control. Meta‐analyses demonstrated no convincing effect of cognitive rehabilitation on subjective measures of attention either immediately after treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) –0.03 to 1.08; P = 0.06; 2 studies, 53 participants; very low‐quality evidence) or at follow‐up (SMD 0.16, 95% CI –0.23 to 0.56; P = 0.41; 2 studies, 99 participants; very low‐quality evidence). People receiving cognitive rehabilitation (when compared with control) showed that measures of divided attention recorded immediately after treatment may improve (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; P < 0.0001; 4 studies, 165 participants; low‐quality evidence), but it is uncertain that these effects persisted (SMD 0.36, 95% CI –0.04 to 0.76; P = 0.08; 2 studies, 99 participants; very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence for immediate or persistent effects of cognitive rehabilitation on alertness, selective attention, and sustained attention. There was no convincing evidence for immediate or long‐term effects of cognitive rehabilitation for attentional problems on functional abilities, mood, and quality of life after stroke. Authors' conclusions The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits following stroke remains unconfirmed. The results suggest there may be an immediate effect after treatment on attentional abilities, but future studies need to assess what helps this effect persist and generalise to attentional skills in daily life. Trials also need to have higher methodological quality and better reporting.","Cognitive rehabilitation for attention problems following stroke Review question Our aim was to review the evidence about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on attention, the ability to perform daily activities, mood, and quality of life in people who have attention problems following a stroke. Background Many people have problems with attention after stroke. They are unable to concentrate for prolonged periods of time and are distractible, being unable to focus on a specific task in the presence of competing information. 'Cognitive rehabilitation' involves providing therapeutic activities to reduce the severity of cognitive problems, like attention, following damage to the brain. The benefit of cognitive rehabilitation for attention problems following stroke is unclear. Study characteristics We identified six studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with a control group who received their usual care (but not cognitive rehabilitation) for people with attention problems following stroke. We did not consider listening to music, meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to be a form of cognitive rehabilitation. The six studies involved 223 participants who demonstrated attentional problems or reported having such problems following stroke. The evidence is current to February 2019. Key results We found no evidence that cognitive rehabilitation improved general (global) measures of attention. The group that received cognitive rehabilitation performed better than the control group on tasks that required people to divide attention. However, this benefit was only seen immediately after the rehabilitation period with no suggestion that the benefits persist for longer. There was no evidence to suggest that cognitive rehabilitation was beneficial for other types of attention problems, or daily life activities, mood, or quality of life. More research is needed. Certainty of the evidence The very low to moderate methodological quality of the studies identified, and the lack of studies means that we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation for attention following stroke.",CD002842
"Background Taking regular exercise, whether cardiovascular‐type exercise or resistance exercise, may help people to give up smoking, particularly by reducing cigarette withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and by helping to manage weight gain. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of exercise‐based interventions alone, or combined with a smoking cessation programme, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation, compared with a smoking cessation intervention alone or other non‐exercise intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for studies, using the term 'exercise' or 'physical activity' in the title, abstract or keywords. The date of the most recent search was May 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared an exercise programme alone, or an exercise programme as an adjunct to a cessation programme, with a cessation programme alone or another non‐exercise control group. Trials were required to recruit smokers wishing to quit or recent quitters, to assess abstinence as an outcome and have follow‐up of at least six months. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking cessation was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available, on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking cessation for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison, as either smoking cessation or relapse prevention. We carried out meta‐analyses where appropriate, using Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects models. Main results We identified 24 eligible trials with a total of 7279 adult participants randomised. Two studies focused on relapse prevention among smokers who had recently stopped smoking, and the remaining 22 studies were concerned with smoking cessation for smokers who wished to quit. Eleven studies were with women only and one with men only. Most studies recruited fairly inactive people. Most of the trials employed supervised, group‐based cardiovascular‐type exercise supplemented by a home‐based exercise programme and combined with a multi‐session cognitive behavioural smoking cessation programme. The comparator in most cases was a multi‐session cognitive behavioural smoking cessation programme alone. Overall, we judged two studies to be at low risk of bias, 11 at high risk of bias, and 11 at unclear risk of bias. Among the 21 studies analysed, we found low‐certainty evidence, limited by potential publication bias and by imprecision, comparing the effect of exercise plus smoking cessation support with smoking cessation support alone on smoking cessation outcomes (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22; I 2  = 0%; 6607 participants). We excluded one study from this analysis as smoking abstinence rates for the study groups were not reported. There was no evidence of subgroup differences according to the type of exercise promoted; the subgroups considered were: cardiovascular‐type exercise alone (17 studies), resistance training alone (one study), combined cardiovascular‐type and resistance exercise (one study) and type of exercise not specified (two studies). The results were not significantly altered when we excluded trials with high risk of bias, or those with special populations, or those where smoking cessation intervention support was not matched between the intervention and control arms. Among the two relapse prevention studies, we found very low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, that adding exercise to relapse prevention did not improve long‐term abstinence compared with relapse prevention alone (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; I 2  = 0%; 453 participants). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that adding exercise to smoking cessation support improves abstinence compared with support alone, but the evidence is insufficient to assess whether there is a modest benefit. Estimates of treatment effect were of low or very low certainty, because of concerns about bias in the trials, imprecision and publication bias. Consequently, future trials may change these conclusions.","Can exercise help people quit smoking? Background We reviewed the evidence about whether exercise helps people who want to quit smoking, or have recently stopped smoking, to stop smoking for at least six months. Taking regular exercise may help people give up smoking by helping with cigarette withdrawal and cravings, and by helping them to manage weight gain, which can be a concern among people trying to quit. Study characteristics We found 24 studies with a total of 7279 people. Two studies focused on helping those who had recently stopped smoking and the rest of the studies included current smokers who wished to quit. All the studies were conducted with adults. Eleven studies were with women only and one with men only. Most studies recruited fairly inactive people. Most studies offered supervised and group‐based, aerobic‐type exercise. The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2019. Key results When we combined the results of 21 studies (6607 participants) which compared exercise and smoking‐cessation programmes to smoking cessation programmes alone, there was no evidence that exercise increased quit rates at six months or longer. There was no evidence that the effect was different for different types of exercise. When we combined results from two studies (453 participants), there was no evidence that exercise helped people who had recently quit to stay quit. Quality of evidence We judged the quality of evidence for whether exercise programmes help people quit smoking as low certainty, suggesting that future research could change these results. The low certainty is because we cannot rule out chance as an explanation for the suggested slight benefit. It could be that exercise may not help at all, or it could be that supporting people to do exercise modestly increases quit rates. We do not know which of these is true. We also consider that a good number of the trials may be biased. We have concerns that small studies which found smaller effects were less likely to be published than small studies which found bigger effects, making the average result misleading. We judged the evidence from two studies examining whether exercise helps people to avoid relapse to smoking to be of very low certainty, again suggesting that more research is needed. This is due to imprecision of the estimated effects and a high risk of bias in the methods used by one of the studies.",CD002295
"Background Older patients with multiple health problems (multi‐morbidity) value being involved in decision‐making about their health care. However, they are less frequently involved than younger patients. To maximise quality of life, day‐to‐day function, and patient safety, older patients require support to identify unmet healthcare needs and to prioritise treatment options. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for older patients with multi‐morbidity aiming to involve them in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; all years to August 2018), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to August 2018); Embase (OvidSP) (1988 to August 2018); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to August 2018); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) (1982 to September 2008), then in Ebsco (2009 to August 2018); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Databases (Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE)) (all years to August 2018); the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (all years to August 2018); the Ongoing Reviews Database (all years to August 2018); and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to August 2018). Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and quasi‐RCTs of interventions to involve patients in decision‐making about their health care versus usual care/control/another intervention, for patients aged 65 years and older with multi‐morbidity in primary care. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Meta‐analysis was not possible; therefore we prepared a narrative synthesis. Main results We included three studies involving 1879 participants: two RCTs and one cluster‐RCT. Interventions consisted of: · patient workshop and individual coaching using behaviour change techniques; · individual patient coaching utilising cognitive‐behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing; and · holistic patient review, multi‐disciplinary practitioner training, and organisational change. No studies reported the primary outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making’ or the primary adverse outcome ‘less patient involvement as a result of the intervention’. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and individual coaching, holistic patient review plus practitioner training, and organisational change) to usual care:  we are uncertain whether interventions had any effect on patient reports of high self‐rated health (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 5.49; very low‐certainty evidence) or on patient enablement (mean difference (MD) 0.60, 95% CI ‐9.23 to 10.43; very low‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Interventions probably had no effect on health‐related quality of life (adjusted difference in means 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.02; moderate‐certainty evidence) or on medication adherence (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.17; moderate‐certainty evidence) but probably improved the number of patients discussing their priorities (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.38; moderate‐certainty evidence) and probably increased the number of nurse consultations (incident rate ratio from adjusted multi‐level Poisson model 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61; moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect rates of participant death or anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admission compared with usual care. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and coaching, individual patient coaching) to attention‐control conditions:  we are uncertain whether interventions affect patient‐reported high self‐rated health (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00, favouring attention control, with very low‐certainty evidence; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.52, favouring the intervention, with very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether interventions affect patient enablement and engagement by increasing either patient activation (MD 1.20, 95% CI ‐8.21 to 10.61; very low‐certainty evidence) or self‐efficacy (MD 0.29, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.79; very low‐certainty evidence); or whether interventions affect the number of general practice visits (MD 0.51, 95% CI ‐0.34 to 1.36; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to attention‐control conditions. The intervention may however lead to more patient‐reported changes in management of their health conditions (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44; low‐certainty evidence). Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect emergency department attendance nor hospital admission when compared with attention control. Comparing one form of intervention with another:  not measured. There was 'unclear' risk across studies for performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias; however, no aspects were 'high' risk. Evidence was downgraded via GRADE, most often because of 'small sample size' and 'evidence from a single study'. Authors' conclusions Limited available evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of this review. Whilst patient involvement in decision‐making is seen as a key mechanism for improving care, it is rarely examined as an intervention and was not measured by included studies. Consistency in design, analysis, and evaluation of interventions would enable a greater likelihood of robust conclusions in future reviews.","Interventions for involving older patients with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making during primary care consultations Background The number of older people with more than one long‐term health problem is steadily increasing worldwide. Such individuals can have complicated healthcare needs. Although they frequently want to be involved in making decisions about their health care, they are less often involved than younger, healthier people. As a result, they may not be offered the same treatment options. Review question We reviewed available evidence about the effects of interventions intended to involve older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. Study characteristics We included research published up until August 2018. We found three relevant studies involving 1879 participants. These studies were reported from three countries. Participants were over 65 years of age with three or more long‐term health problems on average. Interventions investigated included: · patient workshops and individual patient coaching; · patient coaching including cognitive‐behavioural therapy; and · whole‐person patient review, practitioner training, and organisational changes. All studies were funded by national research bodies. Key results None of the studies reported the main outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making about their health care’ nor whether there was less patient involvement as a result of the intervention. Interventions were not found to increase adverse outcomes such as death, anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admissions.. We are uncertain whether interventions for involving older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care can improve their self‐rated health or healthcare engagement, or make any difference in self‐efficacy (one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations) or in the overall number of general practice visits. We can report that these interventions probably make little or no difference in patients' quality of life but probably increase the number of patients discussing their priorities, and are associated with more patient consultations with nurses, when compared to usual care. Interventions may be associated with more changes in the management of health conditions when considered from the patient’s perspective when compared with a control group. The quality of the evidence was limited by small studies, and by studies choosing to measure different outcomes, resulting in lack of data that could be combined in analyses. Conclusions Further research in this developing area is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.",CD013124
"Background Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV is difficult. HIV‐positive individuals have higher rates of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the diagnosis of tuberculosis is often limited to imaging results. Ultrasound is such an imaging test that is widely used as a diagnostic tool (including point‐of‐care) in people suspected of having abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound for detecting abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement in HIV‐positive individuals. To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including clinical setting, ultrasound training level, and type of reference standard. Search methods We searched for publications in any language up to 4 April 2019 in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S), and also ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included cross‐sectional, cohort, and diagnostic case‐control studies (prospective and retrospective) that compared the result of the index test (abdominal ultrasound) with one of the reference standards. We only included studies that allowed for extraction of numbers of true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs). Participants were HIV‐positive individuals aged 15 years and older. A higher‐quality reference standard was the bacteriological confirmation of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  from any clinical specimen, and a lower‐quality reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis without microbiological confirmation. We excluded genitourinary tuberculosis. Data collection and analysis For each study, two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. We assessed the quality of studies using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity. When studies were few we simplified the bivariate model to separate univariate random‐effects logistic regression models for sensitivity and specificity. We explored the influence of the type of reference standard on the accuracy estimates by conducting separate analyses for each type of reference standard. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 11 studies. The risks of bias and concern about applicability were often high or unclear in all domains. We included six studies in the main analyses of any abnormal finding on abdominal ultrasound; five studies reported only individual lesions. The six studies of any abnormal finding were cross‐sectional or cohort studies. Five of these (83%) were conducted in low‐ or middle‐income countries, and one in a high‐income country. The proportion of participants on antiretroviral therapy was none (1 study), fewer then 50% (4 studies), more than 50% (1 study), and not reported (5 studies). The first main analysis, studies using a higher‐quality reference standard (bacteriological confirmation), had a pooled sensitivity of 63% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43% to 79%; 5 studies, 368 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and a pooled specificity of 68% (95% CI 42% to 87%; 5 studies, 511 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). If the results were to be applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people with HIV where 200 (20%) have tuberculosis then: ‐ About 382 individuals would have an ultrasound result indicating tuberculosis; of these, 256 (67%) would be incorrectly classified as having tuberculosis (false positives). ‐ Of the 618 individuals with a result indicating that tuberculosis is not present, 74 (12%) would be incorrectly classified as not having tuberculosis (false negatives). In the second main analysis involving studies using a lower‐quality reference standard (clinical diagnosis), the pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 45% to 85%; 4 studies, 195 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 73% (95% CI 41% to 91%; 4 studies, 202 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions In HIV‐positive individuals thought to have abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement, abdominal ultrasound appears to have 63% sensitivity and 68% specificity when tuberculosis was bacteriologically confirmed. These estimates are based on data that is limited, varied, and low‐certainty. The low sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound means clinicians should not use a negative test result to rule out the disease, but rather consider the result in combination with other diagnostic strategies (including clinical signs, chest x‐ray, lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM), and Xpert MTB/RIF). Research incorporating the test into tuberculosis diagnostic algorithms will help in delineating more precisely its value in diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement. 26 September 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All studies identified during the most recent search (4 Apr, 2019) have been incorporated in the review, and one ongoing study identified","Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement in people with HIV Why is improving tuberculosis diagnosis in people with HIV important? Diagnosing active tuberculosis in people living with HIV is challenging. People with advanced immunosuppression have high rates of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (tuberculosis outside the lungs). What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review is to find out how accurate an ultrasound examination of the abdomen (abdominal ultrasound) is for diagnosing tuberculosis in people with HIV suspected of having tuberculosis in the abdomen or widespread tuberculosis (disseminated tuberculosis) involving the abdomen. What was studied in the review? Abdominal ultrasound can be done after other tests (e.g. the chest x‐ray did not indicate tuberculosis ) or it can be done before other tests in people suspected of having tuberculosis. This review focuses on situations where other tests are not available. What are the main results in this review? We found 11 studies, but only six were relevant for the main analyses. The six studies were divided into two groups. In the first group tuberculosis was diagnosed by identifying the organism causing tuberculosis from any specimen (microbiological confirmation). For the second group, tuberculosis was diagnosed when healthcare personnel suspected tuberculosis and started anti‐tuberculosis treatment, but without identifying the organism (clinical diagnosis). Three studies provided results for both groups. The review included five studies (a total of 879 participants) with microbiological confirmation. The results showed that if abdominal ultrasound were to be used in a group of 1000 people with HIV where 200 (20%) have tuberculosis then: ‐ About 382 individuals would have an ultrasound result indicating tuberculosis; of these, 256 (67%) would be incorrectly classified as having tuberculosis (false positives). ‐ Of the 618 individuals with a result indicating that tuberculosis is not present, 74 (12%) would be incorrectly classified as not having tuberculosis (false negatives). How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? Microbiological confirmation is likely to be a reliable method for deciding whether people really have tuberculosis; clinical diagnosis is likely to be less trustworthy. We found problems in both groups with how studies were conducted. Decreasing the number of false positive results may make abdominal ultrasound appear more accurate than it is. Numbers shown are an average across studies. As estimates from individual studies varied, we cannot be sure that abdominal ultrasound will always produce these results. Not enough people have been studied for us to be confident about the results. Who do the results of the review apply to? Studies included in the main analyses were done in Cambodia, India, South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, and Tanzania. Reasons for including people differed between the studies. Four studies used trained radiologists (specialists) or sonographers; two used doctors trained in ultrasound (non‐specialists), and two included people without any suspicion of tuberculosis. Across the studies, the percentage of people with a final diagnosis of tuberculosis ranged from 18% to 64%. What are the implications of this review? If the test is used to rule in the disease in the absence of other evidence, then, the chance of diagnosing someone with tuberculosis when they actually do not have it is high. Chances of missing a diagnosis of tuberculosis when the test is positive are lower, but a negative test alone is probably insufficient to rule out the disease. These findings should be considered when deciding whether or not to use abdominal ultrasound to test for tuberculosis involving the abdomen and how to interpret the results in the context of other clinical and diagnostic test information. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies up to 4 April 2019.",CD012777
"Background Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in premenopausal women. Although surgery is often used as a treatment, a range of medical therapies are also available. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce prostaglandin levels, which are elevated in women with excessive menstrual bleeding and also may have a beneficial effect on dysmenorrhoea. Objectives To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of NSAIDs in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss (MBL) in women of reproductive years with HMB. Search methods We searched, in April 2019, the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the clinical trial registries and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs or combined with other medical therapy with each other, placebo or other medical treatments in women with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic (treatment‐induced) causes for their HMB. Data collection and analysis We identified 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (759 women) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review and two review authors independently extracted data. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes from the data of nine trials. We described in data tables the results of the remaining seven cross‐over trials with data unsuitable for pooling, one trial with skewed data, and one trial with missing variances. One trial had no data available for analysis. Main results As a group, NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at reducing HMB but less effective than tranexamic acid, danazol or the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS). Treatment with danazol caused a shorter duration of menstruation and more adverse events than NSAIDs, but this did not appear to affect the acceptability of treatment, based on trials from 1980 to 1990. However, currently danazol is not a usual or recommended treatment for HMB. There was no clear evidence of difference between NSAIDs and the other treatments (oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, an older progesterone‐releasing intrauterine system and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), but most studies were underpowered. There was no evidence of a difference between the individual NSAIDs (naproxen and mefenamic acid) in reducing HMB. The evidence quality ranged from low to moderate, the main limitations being risk of bias and imprecision. Authors' conclusions NSAIDs reduce HMB when compared with placebo, but are less effective than tranexamic acid, danazol or LNG IUS. However, adverse events are more severe with danazol therapy. In the limited number of small studies suitable for evaluation, there was no clear evidence of a difference in efficacy between NSAIDs and other medical treatments such as oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, OCP or the older progesterone‐releasing intrauterine system.","Are non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs safe and effective for treating heavy menstrual bleeding? Review question Cochrane authors investigated whether non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) helped reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women before they reach the menopause. Background NSAIDs reduce prostaglandin levels, which are elevated in women with excessive menstrual bleeding. It was suggested that they might help with heavy bleeding and may have a beneficial effect on painful menstrual periods. Study characteristics Authors search medical databases and identified 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 759 women that could be included in the review, but data from only nine trials were suitable for analyses. Key results Women sought help for HMB when it affected their quality of life. Levels of prostaglandin (a naturally occurring hormone) are higher in women with HMB and are reduced by NSAIDs. The review of trials found that NSAIDs were modestly effective in reducing HMB, but other medicines, such as danazol, tranexamic acid and levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS), are more effective. These results were based on a small number of low‐ to moderate‐quality trials. Quality of the evidence The evidence quality ranged from low to moderate, the main limitations being poor reporting of study methods and imprecision resulting from small study numbers.",CD000400
"Background Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting the anterior horn cell of spinal cord, neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves and muscles. NMDs cause physical disability usually due to progressive loss of strength in limb muscles, and some NMDs also cause respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) might be expected to improve respiratory muscle weakness; however, the effects of RMT are still uncertain. This systematic review will synthesize the available trial evidence on the effectiveness and safety of RMT in people with NMD, to inform clinical practice. Objectives To assess the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) for neuromuscular disease (NMD) in adults and children, in comparison to sham training, no training, standard treatment, breathing exercises, or other intensities or types of RMT. Search methods On 19 November 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. On 23 December 2018, we searched the US National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and reference lists of the included studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, including cross‐over trials, of RMT in adults and children with a diagnosis of NMD of any degree of severity, who were living in the community, and who did not need mechanical ventilation. We compared trials of RMT (inspiratory muscle training (IMT) or expiratory muscle training (EMT), or both), with sham training, no training, standard treatment, different intensities of RMT, different types of RMT, or breathing exercises. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results We included 11 studies involving 250 randomized participants with NMDs: three trials (N = 88) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; motor neuron disease), six trials (N = 112) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one trial (N = 23) in people with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) or limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy, and one trial (N = 27) in people with myasthenia gravis. Nine of the trials were at high risk of bias in at least one domain and many reported insufficient information for accurate assessment of the risk of bias. Populations, interventions, control interventions, and outcome measures were often different, which largely ruled out meta‐analysis. All included studies assessed lung capacity, our primary outcome, but four did not provide data for analysis (1 in people with ALS and three cross‐over studies in DMD). None provided long‐term data (over a year) and only one trial, in ALS, provided information on adverse events. Unscheduled hospitalisations for chest infection or acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure were not reported and physical function and quality of life were reported in one (ALS) trial. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Three trials compared RMT versus sham training in ALS. Short‐term (8 weeks) effects of RMT on lung capacity in ALS showed no clear difference in the change of the per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) between EMT and sham EMT groups (mean difference (MD) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐8.48 to 9.88; N = 46; low‐certainty evidence). The mean difference (MD) in FVC% after four months' treatment was 10.86% in favour of IMT (95% CI ‐4.25 to 25.97; 1 trial, N = 24; low‐certainty evidence), which is larger than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID, as estimated in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). There was no clear difference between IMT and sham IMT groups, measured on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALFRS; range of possible scores 0 = best to 40 = worst) (MD 0.85, 95% CI ‐2.16 to 3.85; 1 trial, N = 24; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life, measured on the EuroQol‐5D (0 = worst to 100 = best) (MD 0.77, 95% CI ‐17.09 to 18.62; 1 trial, N = 24; low‐certainty evidence) over the medium term (4 months). One trial report stated that the IMT protocol had no adverse effect (very low‐certainty evidence). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) Two DMD trials compared RMT versus sham training in young males with DMD. In one study, the mean post‐intervention (6‐week) total lung capacity (TLC) favoured RMT (MD 0.45 L, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 1.14; 1 trial, N = 16; low‐certainty evidence). In the other trial there was no clear difference in post‐intervention (18 days) FVC between RMT and sham RMT (MD 0.16 L, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.63; 1 trial, N = 20; low‐certainty evidence). One RCT and three cross‐over trials compared a form of RMT with no training in males with DMD; the cross‐over trials did not provide suitable data. Post‐intervention (6‐month) values showed no clear difference between the RMT and no training groups in per cent predicted vital capacity (VC%) (MD 3.50, 95% CI ‐14.35 to 21.35; 1 trial, N = 30; low‐certainty evidence). Becker or limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy One RCT (N = 21) compared 12 weeks of IMT with breathing exercises in people with Becker or limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy. The evidence was of very low certainty and conclusions could not be drawn. Myasthenia gravis In myasthenia gravis, there may be no clear difference between RMT and breathing exercises on measures of lung capacity, in the short term (TLC MD ‐0.20 L, 95% CI ‐1.07 to 0.67; 1 trial, N = 27; low‐certainty evidence). Effects of RMT on quality of life are uncertain (1 trial; N = 27). Some trials reported effects of RMT on inspiratory and/or expiratory muscle strength; this evidence was also of low or very low certainty. Authors' conclusions RMT may improve lung capacity and respiratory muscle strength in some NMDs. In ALS there may not be any clinically meaningful effect of RMT on physical functioning or quality of life and it is uncertain whether it causes adverse effects. Due to clinical heterogeneity between the trials and the small number of participants included in the analysis, together with the risk of bias, these results must be interpreted very cautiously.","Respiratory muscle training in children and adults with neuromuscular disease Review question Does respiratory muscle training have beneficial effects for children and adults with neuromuscular disease? Background Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that covers many diseases that either directly or indirectly affect muscles or nerves. Children and adults with neuromuscular diseases can present with muscle weakness, loss of movement control, and muscle wasting. Some neuromuscular diseases cause weakness of respiratory muscles (diaphragm and accessory muscles of respiration). The decline of respiratory muscle function in these diseases affects activities of daily living and quality of life. Respiratory muscle training could potentially be considered as an extra therapy for people with suspected or confirmed respiratory muscle weakness. Study characteristics This review included 11 studies with a total of 250 randomized participants with neuromuscular disease. Six studies included 112 young males (including children) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is an inherited muscle disease. One trial involved 23 adults with other muscle diseases (Becker muscular dystrophy and limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy). Three trials involved 88 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive condition that affects the nerves controlling movement. One trial involved 27 people with myasthenia gravis, a condition that affects the signals between nerves and muscles. Key results The studies showed that respiratory muscle training may result in some improvements in lung function for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, this finding was not consistent between studies. Physical function and quality of life were only assessed in one amyotrophic lateral sclerosis trial, which indicated that RMT may have no clear effect. One trial reported on adverse events, but the certainty of evidence was too low for conclusions to be drawn. The studies did not report the number of unscheduled hospitalisations for sudden infection or worsening of chronic respiratory failure. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence examined as part of this review was low or very low. Low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence in the effect of respiratory muscle training is limited, and the true effect may be substantially different. When the evidence is of very low‐certainty, the true effect is likely to be substantially different. Given the low or very low‐certainty of the evidence presented in the studies, we believe that there is a need for more well‐conducted studies in order to assess the efficacy of respiratory muscle training in people with NMD. The evidence is current to November 2018.",CD011711
"Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that leads to decreased health‐related quality of life and work productivity. A previous version of this review was not able to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS and recommended that further high quality RCTs were conducted to explore the clinical and cost effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review: 1. Clinical homeopathy where a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition; 2. Individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Search methods For this update we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register and trials registers from inception to 31 August 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case‐control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS as measured by an IBS symptom severity score. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, and adverse events. The overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. Main results Four RCTs (307 participants) were included. Two studies compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy, asafoetida or asafoetida plus nux vomica) to placebo for IBS with constipation (IBS‐C). One study compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care for the treatment of IBS in female patients. One study was a three armed RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening or usual care. The risk of bias in three studies (the two studies assessing clinical homeopathy and the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care) was unclear on most criteria and high for selective reporting in one of the clinical homeopathy studies. The three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care and supportive listening was at low risk of bias in four of the domains and high risk of bias in two (performance bias and detection bias). A meta‐analysis of the studies assessing clinical homeopathy, (171 participants with IBS‐C) was conducted. At short‐term follow‐up of two weeks, global improvement in symptoms was experienced by 73% (46/63) of asafoetida participants compared to 45% (30/66) of placebo participants (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18; 2 studies, very low certainty evidence). In the other clinical homeopathy study at two weeks, 68% (13/19) of those in the asafoetida plus nux vomica arm and 52% (12/23) of those in the placebo arm experienced a global improvement in symptoms (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15; very low certainty evidence). In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care (N = 20), the mean global improvement score (feeling unwell) at 12 weeks was 1.44  +  4.55 (n = 9) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 1.41  +  1.97 (n=11) in the usual care arm (MD 0.03; 95% CI ‐3.16 to 3.22; very low certainty evidence). In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44  +  112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 237.3 + 110.22 (n = 60) in the usual care arm (MD ‐26.86, 95% CI ‐88.59 to 34.87; low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score (EQ‐5D) at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.41 (SD 23.31) in usual care participants (MD 5.66, 95% CI ‐4.69 to 16.01; low certainty evidence). For In the study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to supportive listening, the mean IBS symptom severity score at 6 months was 210.44  +  112.4 (n = 16) in the individualised homeopathic treatment arm compared to 262 + 120.72 (n = 18) in the supportive listening arm (MD ‐51.56, 95% CI ‐129.94 to 26.82; very low certainty evidence). The mean quality of life score at 6 months in homeopathy participants was 69.07 (SD 17.35) compared to 63.09 (SD 24.38) in supportive listening participants (MD 5.98, 95% CI ‐8.13 to 20.09; very low certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, or adverse events. Authors' conclusions The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy for the treatment of IBS can be drawn. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy for IBS compared to placebo or usual care.","Homeopathy for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome What is irritable bowel syndrome? Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder where a person experiences the following symptoms: abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, constipation or diarrhoea or both. It is difficult to treat because different people experience different symptoms. Some people experience constipation as the main symptom, this form of IBS is known as IBS‐C, while others experience diarrhoea as the main symptom. This form of IBS is known as IBS‐D. Others experience both constipation and diarrhoea, this form of IBS is known as IBS‐M where the M stands for mixed. Currently there is no agreement on the best form of treatment for IBS.This means that it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments, including homeopathic treatment, which some IBS sufferers use. What is homeopathy? There are different types of homeopathy. Clinical homeopathy matches a 'remedy' to a specific condition, such as IBS and everybody who has that condition would be given the same remedy. Individualised homeopathy involves a series of in‐depth consultations to assess symptoms and other issues that may affect the patient. Following an in‐depth consultation the homeopath will select the most appropriate remedy based on the persons' individual symptoms. Individualised homeopathy includes both a consultation and a remedy, whereas clinical homeopathy consists of a remedy without the in‐depth consultation. What did the researchers investigate? The researchers investigated whether homeopathic treatment led to the improvement of the symptoms of IBS in people with IBS. What did the researchers find? Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 307 participants with IBS were included. Two RCTs (129 participants) compared a homeopathic remedy (asafoetida and asafoetida plus nux vomica) to a placebo remedy for the treatment of people with IBS‐C. One study (23 participants) compared individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care in female patients diagnosed with IBS. One study (94 participants) was a three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment plus usual care, supportive listening plus usual care and usual care. The four trials tested the effects of homeopathic treatment on the severity of IBS symptoms. No conclusions can be drawn from the RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care due to the small number of participants and the low quality of reporting in this trial. This study was carried out in 1990 and usual care for IBS may have changed since then making the results difficult to compare to current treatments. No conclusions can be drawn from the three armed study comparing individualised homeopathic treatment plus usual care, supportive listening plus usual care and usual care due to the small number of participants in the homeopathic treatment arm (n=16). The results of two small studies were combined (129 participants) and this suggested that there may be a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for patients with IBS‐C at a short‐term follow‐up of two weeks. However both of the studies were carried out in the 1970s when the reporting of trials was not as comprehensive as it is now and we are very uncertain about these results and cannot suggest a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy. Conclusions The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of homeopathy for the treatment of IBS can be drawn. Further high quality RCTs enrolling larger numbers of patients are required to assess the effectiveness and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy for IBS.",CD009710
"Background Overconsumption of food, alcohol, and tobacco products increases the risk of non‐communicable diseases. Interventions to change characteristics of physical micro‐environments where people may select or consume these products ‐ including shops, restaurants, workplaces, and schools – are of considerable public health policy and research interest. This review addresses two types of intervention within such environments: altering the availability (the range and/or amount of options) of these products, or their proximity (the distance at which they are positioned) to potential consumers. Objectives 1. To assess the impact on selection and consumption of altering the availability or proximity of (a) food (including non‐alcoholic beverages), (b) alcohol, and (c) tobacco products. 2. To assess the extent to which the impact of these interventions is modified by characteristics of: i. studies, ii. interventions, and iii. participants. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and seven other published or grey literature databases, as well as trial registries and key websites, up to 23 July 2018, followed by citation searches. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials with between‐participants (parallel group) or within‐participants (cross‐over) designs. Eligible studies compared effects of exposure to at least two different levels of availability of a product or its proximity, and included a measure of selection or consumption of the manipulated product. Data collection and analysis We used a novel semi‐automated screening workflow and applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies, collect data, and assess risk of bias. In separate analyses for availability interventions and proximity interventions, we combined results using random‐effects meta‐analysis and meta‐regression models to estimate summary effect sizes (as standardised mean differences (SMDs)) and to investigate associations between summary effect sizes and selected study, intervention, or participant characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using GRADE. Main results We included 24 studies, with the majority (20/24) giving concerns about risk of bias. All of the included studies investigated food products; none investigated alcohol or tobacco. The majority were conducted in laboratory settings (14/24), with adult participants (17/24), and used between‐participants designs (19/24). All studies were conducted in high‐income countries, predominantly in the USA (14/24). Six studies investigated availability interventions, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less‐healthy (to healthier) options. Most studies (4/6) manipulated snack foods or drinks. For selection outcomes, meta‐analysis of three comparisons from three studies (n = 154) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a large reduction in selection of the targeted food(s): SMD −1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.90 to −0.37) (low certainty evidence). For consumption outcomes, meta‐analysis of three comparisons from two studies (n = 150) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a moderate reduction in consumption of those foods, but with considerable uncertainty: SMD −0.55 (95% CI −1.27 to 0.18) (low certainty evidence). Eighteen studies investigated proximity interventions. Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line. For selection outcomes, only one study with one comparison (n = 41) was identified, which found that food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its selection: SMD −0.65 (95% CI −1.29 to −0.01) (very low certainty evidence). For consumption outcomes, meta‐analysis of 15 comparisons from 12 studies (n = 1098) found that exposure to food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its consumption: SMD −0.60 (95% CI −0.84 to −0.36) (low certainty evidence). Meta‐regression analyses indicated that this effect was greater: the farther away the product was placed; when only the targeted product(s) was available; when participants were of low deprivation status; and when the study was at high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions The current evidence suggests that changing the number of available food options or altering the positioning of foods could contribute to meaningful changes in behaviour, justifying policy actions to promote such changes within food environments. However, the certainty of this evidence as assessed by GRADE is low or very low. To enable more certain and generalisable conclusions about these potentially important effects, further research is warranted in real‐world settings, intervening across a wider range of foods ‐ as well as alcohol and tobacco products ‐ and over sustained time periods.","Altering the availability or proximity of food, alcohol, and tobacco products to change their selection and consumption Unhealthy patterns of consumption of food, alcohol, and tobacco products are important causes of ill health. Changing the availability (the range or amount of options, or both) of these products or their proximity (the distance at which they are positioned) to potential consumers could help people make healthier choices. What is the aim of this review? This review investigated whether altering the availability or proximity of food (including non‐alcoholic beverages), alcohol, and tobacco products changed people's selection (such as purchasing) or consumption of those products. We searched for all available evidence from randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to answer this question, and found 24 studies, all of which were conducted in high‐income countries. What are the main results of the review? Six studies involved availability interventions, of which four changed the relative proportion of less‐healthy to healthier options, and two changed the absolute number of different options available. In statistical analyses that combined results from multiple studies, it was found that reducing the number of available options for a particular range or category of food(s) reduced selection of those food products (from analysing 154 participants) and possibly reduced consumption of those products (from 150 participants). However, the certainty of the evidence for these effects was low. Eighteen studies involved proximity interventions. Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line. One study found that this reduced selection of food (from analysing 41 participants), whilst in a statistical analysis combining results from multiple studies, it was found that placing food farther away reduced consumption of those food products (from analysing 1098 participants). However, the certainty of the evidence for these effects was very low and low, respectively. Key messages Mindful of its limitations, the current evidence suggests that changing the number of available food options or changing where foods are positioned could contribute to meaningful changes in behaviour, justifying policy actions to promote such changes to food environments. However, more high‐quality studies in real‐world settings are needed to make this finding more certain. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence is current to 23 July 2018.",CD012573
"Background Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that presents with itching, red, scaling plaques; its worsening has been associated with obesity, drinking, smoking, lack of sleep, and a sedentary lifestyle. Lifestyle changes may improve psoriasis. Objectives To assess the effects of lifestyle changes for psoriasis, including weight reduction, alcohol abstinence, smoking cessation, dietary modification, exercise, and other lifestyle change interventions. Search methods We searched the following databases up to July 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Airiti Library, and five trials registers up to July 2018. We checked the references of included trials for further relevant trials, and we asked the authors of the included trials if they were aware of any relevant unpublished data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle changes (either alone or in combination) for treating psoriasis in people diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Treatment had to be given for at least 12 weeks. Eligible comparisons were no lifestyle changes or another active intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Severity of psoriasis' and 'Adherence to the intervention'. Secondary outcomes were 'Quality of life', 'Time to relapse', and 'Reduction in comorbidities'. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 10 RCTs with 1163 participants (mean age: 43 to 61 years; 656 men and 478 women were reported). Six trials examined the effects of dietary intervention (low‐calorie diet) in 499 obese participants (mean age: 44.3 to 61 years; where reported, 395 had moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis). One trial assessed a combined dietary intervention and exercise programme in 303 obese participants with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis who had started a systemic therapy for psoriasis and had not achieved clearance after four weeks of continuous treatment (median age: 53 years). Another trial assessed a walking exercise and continuous health education in 200 participants (mean age: 43.1 years, severity not reported). Finally, two trials included education programmes promoting a healthy lifestyle in 161 participants (aged 18 to 78 years), with one trial on mild psoriasis and the other trial not reporting severity. Comparisons included information only; no intervention; medical therapy alone; and usual care (such as continuing healthy eating). All trials were conducted in hospitals and treated participants for between 12 weeks and three years. One trial did not report the treatment period. Seven trials measured the outcomes at the end of treatment and there was no additional follow‐up. In two trials, there was follow‐up after the treatment ended. Five trials had a high risk of performance bias, and four trials had a high risk of attrition bias. We found no trials assessing interventions for alcohol abstinence or smoking cessation. No trials assessed time to relapse. Only two trials assessed adverse events; in one trial these were caused by the add‐on therapy ciclosporin (given in both groups). The trial comparing two dietary interventions to a no‐treatment group observed no adverse events. The results presented in this abstract are based on trials of obese participants. Outcomes for dietary interventions versus usual care were measured 24 weeks to six months from baseline. Compared to usual care, dietary intervention (strict caloric restriction) may lead to 75% or greater improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.58; 2 trials, 323 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adherence to the intervention may be greater with the dietary intervention than usual care, but the 95% CI indicates that the dietary intervention might also make little or no difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.09; 2 trials, 105 participants; low‐quality evidence). Dietary intervention probably achieves a greater improvement in dermatology quality‐of‐life index (DLQI) score compared to usual care (MD −12.20, 95% CI −13.92 to −10.48; 1 trial, 36 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and probably reduces the BMI compared to usual care (MD −4.65, 95% CI −5.93 to −3.36; 2 trials, 78 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Outcomes for dietary interventions plus exercise programme were measured 16 weeks from baseline and are based on one trial (303 participants). Compared to information only (on reducing weight to improve psoriasis), combined dietary intervention and exercise programme (dietetic plan and physical activities) probably improves psoriasis severity, but the 95% CI indicates that the intervention might make little or no difference (PASI 75: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.98). This combined intervention probably results in a greater reduction in BMI (median change −1.10 kg/m², P = 0.002), but there is probably no difference in adherence (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01; 137/151 and 145/152 participants adhered in the treatment and control group, respectively). There were no data on quality of life. These outcomes are based on moderate‐quality evidence. Authors' conclusions Dietary intervention may reduce the severity of psoriasis (low‐quality evidence) and probably improves quality of life and reduces BMI (moderate‐quality evidence) in obese people when compared with usual care, while combined dietary intervention and exercise programme probably improves psoriasis severity and BMI when compared with information only (moderate‐quality evidence). None of the trials measured quality of life. We did not detect a clear difference in treatment adherence between those in the combined dietary intervention and exercise programme group and those given information only (moderate‐quality evidence). Adherence may be improved through dietary intervention compared with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Participants generally adhered well to the lifestyle interventions assessed in the review. No trials assessed the time to relapse. Trial limitations included unblinded participants and high dropout rate. Future trials should reduce dropouts and include comprehensive outcome measures; they should examine whether dietary intervention with or without an exercise programme is effective in non‐obese people with psoriasis, whether an additional exercise programme is more effective than dietary intervention alone, whether the time to relapse prolongs in people who receive dietary intervention with or without exercise programme, and whether smoking cessation and alcohol abstinence are effective in treating psoriasis.","Lifestyle changes for treating psoriasis Review question We wanted to see whether lifestyle changes (e.g. changing diet, exercising, and avoiding smoking and drinking alcohol), alone or combined, were useful in treating psoriasis when compared to no such changes or another psoriasis treatment. Background Psoriasis is a long‐lasting, inflammatory skin disease; it causes thick, red, itching, and scaling patches. Obesity, drinking, smoking, and an inactive lifestyle can worsen psoriasis. We intended to find out if lifestyle changes can improve psoriasis severity and quality of life, and reduce comorbidities (other conditions occurring alongside a primary condition). Trial characteristics We included 10 trials, with 1163 participants, which assessed the effects of low‐calorie diet alone; low‐calorie diet combined with an exercise programme; a combination of walking exercise and continuous health education; and educational instructions to promote a healthy lifestyle (diet, smoking, and alcohol abstinence). We examined the research evidence up to July 2018. Non‐profit organisations funded four trials, one trial received funding for the education programme from pharmaceutical companies, and the other five trials had no funding or did not report the funding source. All participants were aged at least 18 years (mean age: 43 to 61 years). Where reported, the trials included 656 men and 478 women; all were set in a hospital. In four trials, the participants were limited to people with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. One trial included participants who had initially been treated with oral medicines for moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis but whose psoriasis had not cleared after four weeks. In four trials, all severities of psoriasis were eligible, but these trials either did not report the participants’ psoriasis severity or only provided average severity scores. One trial included participants with mild psoriasis. Trials compared lifestyle change interventions with usual care (including to continue healthy eating), information only, no treatment, or medical treatment alone. Treatment was given for between 12 weeks to three years. Key results The following results are based on obese participants and compare lifestyle change interventions (low‐calorie diet) to usual care. A low‐calorie diet may reduce the severity of psoriasis (when assessed as the proportion of participants achieving at least 75% improvement from the start of treatment in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75), a widely used tool for the measurement of psoriasis severity) (low‐quality evidence) and probably improves quality of life (moderate‐quality evidence). Participants on a low‐calorie diet may be more likely to stick to treatment (treatment adherence), but treatment effects vary so it is possible that it may make little or no difference (low‐quality evidence). A low‐calorie diet probably improves BMI (body mass index: a healthy weight calculator) (moderate‐quality evidence). The trials did not say how long they treated participants before they stopped dieting (time to relapse). The following results are based on obese participants and compare lifestyle change interventions (low‐calorie diet plus an exercise programme) to weight‐loss information aimed at improving psoriasis. A low‐calorie diet plus an exercise programme probably results in a greater reduction in the severity of psoriasis (based on PASI 75), but the effects of this treatment vary, so it is possible that it may make little or no difference. There is probably no difference in treatment adherence between the two groups; however, a low‐calorie diet plus exercise programme probably improves BMI reduction (all outcomes based on moderate‐quality evidence). Trials did not report quality of life or time to relapse. Only two trials in this review assessed side effects. In one trial side effects were caused by an additional therapy given to both groups of participants (they were not caused by the dietary treatment). The other trial, which compared two dietary treatments to no treatment, did not observe any side effects. Generally, participants complied with the assessed lifestyle changes successfully. We found no trials on alcohol abstinence or smoking cessation. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence was moderate to low for the outcomes 'Severity of psoriasis' and 'Adherence to the intervention' and moderate for 'Reduction in comorbidities: change in Body Mass Index (BMI)'. Quality of life, measured in only one of the two key comparisons, was based on moderate‐quality evidence. Trial limitations included participants knowing which treatment they were receiving and large number of participants withdrawing from trials.",CD011972
"Background Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is typically a mild, self‐limiting condition that can affect both preterm and term neonates, although it can be severe particularly when associated with co‐morbidities. Pharmacological interventions with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), antacid, bismuth and sucralfate may have effects on both the prevention and treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in infants. Objectives To assess how different pharmacological interventions (PPIs, H2RAs, antacids, sucralfate or bismuth salts) administered to preterm and term neonates for the prevention or treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to reduce morbidity and mortality compare with placebo or no treatment, supportive care, or each other. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 6), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 12 July 2018), Embase (1980 to 12 July 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 12 July 2018). We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials, and online for Chinese literature articles . Selection criteria We selected randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials involving preterm and term neonates. Trials were included if they used a proton pump inhibitor, H2 receptor antagonist, antacid, sucralfate or bismuth either for the prevention or treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We conducted meta‐analysis using a fixed‐effect model. We used the GRADE approach to assess quality of evidence. Main results Eleven studies with 818 infants met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Four trials with 329 infants assessed the use of an H2 receptor antagonist for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in high‐risk newborn infants. Meta‐analysis of these four trials identified a reduction in any upper gastrointestinal bleeding when using an H2 receptor antagonist (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.58; typical risk difference (RD) −0.20, 95% CI −0.28 to −0.11; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95% CI 4 to 9). The quality of evidence was moderate. A single trial with 53 infants assessing prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding reported no difference in mortality in infants assigned H2 receptor antagonist versus no treatment; however the quality of evidence was very low. Seven trials with 489 infants assessed an inhibitor of gastric acid (H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor) for treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants. Meta‐analysis of two trials (131 infants) showed no difference in mortality from use of a H2 receptor antagonist compared to no treatment. The quality of evidence was low. Meta‐analysis of two trials (104 infants) showed a reduction in duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from use of an inhibitor of gastric acid compared to no treatment (mean difference −1.06 days, 95% CI −1.28 to −0.84). The quality of evidence was very low. Meta‐analysis of six trials (451 infants) showed a reduction in continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding from use of any inhibitor of gastric acid compared to no treatment (typical RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.49; typical RD −0.26, 95% CI −0.33, −0.19; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). The quality of evidence was low. There were no significant subgroup differences in duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or of continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding according to type of inhibitor of gastric acid. A single trial (38 infants) reported no difference in anaemia requiring blood transfusion from use of a H2 receptor antagonist compared to no treatment. Although no serious adverse events were reported from the use of a H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor, some neonatal morbidities — including necrotising enterocolitis, ventilator‐associated pneumonia, duration of ventilation and respiratory support, and duration of hospital stay — were not reported. Long‐term outcome was not reported. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence that use of an H2 receptor antagonist reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is low‐quality evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid (H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor) reduces the duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the incidence of continued gastric bleeding in newborn infants with gastrointestinal bleeding. However, there is no evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid in newborn infants affects mortality or the need for blood transfusion. As no study reported the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, ventilator‐ or hospital‐associated pneumonia, sepsis, or long‐term outcome, the safety of inhibitors of gastric acid secretion is unclear.","Pharmacological interventions to prevent and treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding in neonates Review question   To assess how different medications for reducing stomach acidity (proton pump inhibitors, histamine 2 receptor antagonists, antacids) or for protecting the stomach lining (sucralfate or bismuth salts) given to preterm and term infants help to prevent or treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding, reduce suffering of other illnesses and deaths. Background   Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common in sick newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care. It may be associated with reflux of milk (gastroesophageal reflux) or allergy to milk proteins. Common symptoms include vomiting of material which can be either bloodstained or like coffee grounds in appearance; and black, tarry stools. When occurring in otherwise well newborns it is typically a mild, self‐limiting condition. However, upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be severe particularly when associated with other underlying conditions. Study characteristics   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The search is up to date as of 12 July 2018. Key results   We found 11 trials with 818 infants. We considered no trial to be at low risk of bias. Four trials included 329 infants in neonatal intensive care units and used a histamine 2 receptor antagonist for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These four trials demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, but no change in mortality. Outcomes such as serious gastrointestinal problems (e.g. necrotising enterocolitis) and infections were not reported. Seven trials with 489 infants enrolled sick newborn infants with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and used either a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor for treatment. Use of a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in a treatment context was associated with a reduction of both duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however it did not affect mortality or requirement for blood transfusion. No long‐term follow‐up was reported. Although there is moderate‐quality evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid reduces the incidence and duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants, there is insufficient safety data in this population. The implication of this is that caution should be applied when deciding whether to use an inhibitor of gastric acid in sick newborn infants until additional studies are performed. Quality of the evidence   We graded the quality of evidence for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as low and moderate. We graded the quality of evidence for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as low and very low.",CD011785
"Background Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed by an elevated thyroid‐stimulating hormone concentration with a normal concentration of free thyroxine hormone. Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is diagnosed by the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, regardless of thyroid hormone levels. Thyroxine may be a useful treatment for subfertile women with these two specific types of thyroid disease for improving pregnancy outcomes during assisted reproduction. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and harms of levothyroxine replacement in subfertile women with subclinical hypothyroidism or with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity (euthyroid autoimmune thyroid disease, or euthyroid ATD) undergoing assisted reproduction. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and two trials registers together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify studies. We searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thyroxine with no treatment or placebo, without language restrictions, from inception to 8 April 2019, and in consultation with the Cochrane CGF Information Specialist. Selection criteria We included women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, meaning both in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, with a history of subfertility and with subclinical hypothyroidism or with euthyroid ATD. We excluded women with a previously known clinical hypothyroidism or already taking thyroxine or tri‐iodothyronine. RCTs compared thyroxine (levothyroxine) with either placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary review outcomes were live birth and adverse events of thyroxine; our secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and miscarriage. Main results The review included four studies with 820 women. The included studies were of overall low risk of bias. Using GRADE methodology, we assessed the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes of this review to be very low‐ to low‐quality evidence. Evidence was downgraded for imprecision as it was based on single, small trials with wide confidence intervals (CI). We were able to include data from three of the four included studies. In one study of women with both subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti‐TPO antibodies (autoimmune disease), the evidence suggested that thyroxine replacement may have improved live birth rate (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.21; 1 RCT, n = 64; low‐quality evidence) and it may have led to similar miscarriage rates (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.98; 1 RCT, n = 64; low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggested that women with both subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti‐TPO antibodies would have a 25% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and that the chance of a live birth in these women using thyroxine would be between 27% and 100%. In women with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity (euthyroid ATD), treatment with thyroxine replacement compared with placebo or no treatment may have led to similar live birth rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.29; 2 RCTs, number of participants (n) = 686; I 2  = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and miscarriage rates (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.46, 2 RCTs, n = 686, I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggested that women with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity would have a 31% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and that the chance of a live birth in these women using thyroxine would be between 26% and 40%. Adverse events were rarely reported. One RCT reported 0/32 in the thyroxine replacement group and 1/32 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti‐TPO antibodies. One RCT reported 21/300 preterm births in the thyroxine replacement group and 19/300 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with positive anti‐TPO antibodies. None of the RCTs reported on other maternal pregnancy complications, foetal complications or adverse effects of thyroxine. Authors' conclusions We could draw no clear conclusions in this systematic review due to the very low to low quality of the evidence reported.","Thyroxine replacement therapy for subfertile women with autoimmune thyroid disease or mildly underactive thyroid Review question Does hormone supplementation with thyroxine (levothyroxine) improve fertility outcomes after in vitro fertilisation (a fertility treatment where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (a fertility treatment where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg) for women diagnosed with presence of thyroid antibodies (autoimmune thyroid disease; ATD) or mildly underactive thyroid? Background Thyroid disease is the second most common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Research has shown a higher rate of miscarriage and reduced fertility in women with underactive (slow‐working) thyroid, with both thyroid hormones measured in blood testing being low. However, there is also a mild variant of this thyroid disease, the so‐called 'subclinical' or mildly underactive thyroid in which affected people show no symptoms and only have a mild change in one of the thyroid hormones when testing blood levels. Another mild variant of thyroid disease is the so‐called 'ATD,' with normal thyroid hormone levels, but the presence of thyroid antibodies. Antibodies could attack a woman's own body cells, and the presence of thyroid antibodies is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage. To date, it is unclear what these mild subtypes of thyroid disease do to female fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Study characteristics Cochrane authors performed a comprehensive literature search of the standard medical databases to 8 April 2019 in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Information Specialist, for randomised clinical trials (RCTs: clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating the effect of thyroid hormones (levothyroxine) for women diagnosed with ATD or mildly underactive thyroid who were planning to undergo assisted reproduction. Two authors independently selected studies, evaluated them, extracted data and attempted to contact the authors where data were missing. We found four RCTs (with 820 women) that met our inclusion requirements. The thyroid hormones were administered in a range of doses to women diagnosed with mildly underactive thyroid or presence of thyroid antibodies (ATD). Key results In women with mild thyroid hormone imbalance and unknown thyroid autoimmunity status, we were uncertain whether thyroxine replacement had an effect on live birth or miscarriage rates (very low‐quality evidence from one study involving 70 women). In women with mildly underactive thyroids (with or without ATD), the evidence suggested that thyroxine replacement may have improved live birth rates (low‐quality evidence from one study involving 64 women) and it may have led to similar miscarriage rates (low‐quality evidence from one study involving 64 women). The evidence suggested that women with mildly underactive thyroid (with or without ATD) would have a 25% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and 27% to 100% with thyroxine. In women with ATD and normal thyroid function, treatment with thyroxine replacement compared with placebo or no treatment may have led to similar live birth rates (low‐quality evidence from two studies involving 686 women) and miscarriage rates (low quality evidence from two studies involving 686 women). The evidence suggested that women with ATD and normal thyroid function would have a 31% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and 26% to 40% with thyroxine. Side effects were rarely reported. One study reported none out of 32 preterm births in the thyroxine replacement group and one out of 32 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with mildly underactive thyroid (with or without ATD). One study reported 21 out of 300 preterm births in the thyroxine replacement group and 19 out of 300 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with ATD and normal thyroid function. None of the studies reported on other maternal pregnancy complications, foetal complications or side effects of thyroxine. Quality of the evidence The evidence was of very low to low quality. We downgraded the evidence as it was based on single, small trials with widely variable results.",CD011009
"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a liver disease caused by hepatitis B virus, which may lead to serious complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. People with HBV infection may also have coinfections including HIV and other hepatitis viruses (hepatitis C or D), and coinfections may increase the risk of all‐cause mortality. Chronic HBV infection increases morbidity, psychological stress, and it is an economic burden on people with chronic hepatitis B and their families. Radix Sophorae flavescentis, a herbal medicine, is administered mostly in combination with other drugs or herbs. It is believed that it decreases discomfort and prevents the replication of the virus in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, the benefits and harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis on patient‐centred outcomes are unknown, and its wide usage has never been established with rigorous review methodology. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other drugs or herbs in people with chronic hepatitis B. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases to December 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ), and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for ongoing or unpublished trials to December 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding, comparing Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other drugs or herbs for people with chronic hepatitis B. In addition to chronic hepatitis B, participants could also have had cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or any other concomitant disease. We excluded polyherbal blends containing Radix Sophorae flavescentis. We allowed cointerventions when the cointerventions were administered equally to all intervention groups. Data collection and analysis Review authors in pairs individually retrieved data from published reports and after correspondence with investigators. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were hepatitis B‐related mortality, hepatitis B‐related morbidity, and adverse events considered 'not to be serious'. We presented the meta‐analysed results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the risk of bias using domains with predefined definitions. We conducted Trial Sequential Analyses to control the risks of random errors. We used GRADE methodology to evaluate our certainty in the evidence (i.e. ""the extent of our confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct or are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation""). Main results We included 10 randomised clinical trials with 898 participants. We judged all trials at high risk of bias. The trials covered oral capsules, intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection, and acupoint (a specifically chosen site of acupuncture) injection of Radix Sophorae flavescentis with a follow‐up period from 1 to 12 months. The drugs being used as a comparator were lamivudine, adefovir, interferon, tiopronin, thymosin, or other Chinese herbs. Two trials included children up to 14 years old. Participants in one trial had cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B. None of the trials reported all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life, serious adverse events, hepatitis B‐related mortality, or morbidity. We are uncertain as to whether Radix Sophorae flavescentis has a beneficial or harmful effect on adverse events considered 'not to be serious' (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.75; I 2  = 0%; 2 trials, 163 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), as well as if it decreases or increases the proportion of participants with detectable HBV‐DNA (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.63; I 2  = 92%; 8 trials, 719 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Radix Sophorae flavescentis showed a reduction in the proportion of participants with detectable hepatitis B virus e‐antigen (HBeAg) (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98; I 2  = 43%; 7 trials, 588 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two of the 10 trials were not funded, and one received academic funding. The remaining seven trials provided no information on funding. The randomisation process in another 109 trials was insufficiently reported to ensure the inclusion of any of these studies in our review. Authors' conclusions The included trials lacked data on all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life, serious adverse events, hepatitis‐B related mortality, and hepatitis‐B related morbidity. The evidence on the effect of Radix Sophorae flavescentis on the proportion of participants with adverse events considered 'not to be serious' and on the proportion of participants with detectable HBV‐DNA is still unclear. We advise caution regarding the results of Radix Sophorae flavescentis showing a reduction in the proportion of people with detectable HBeAg because the trials were at high risk of bias, because it is a non‐validated surrogate outcome, and because of the very low certainty in the evidence. As we were unable to obtain information on a large number of studies regarding their trial design, we were deterred from including them in our review. Undisclosed funding may have influence on trial results and lead to poor design of the trial. In view of the wide usage of Radix Sophorae flavescentis, we need large, unbiased, high‐quality placebo‐controlled randomised trials assessing patient‐centred outcomes.","Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other medicines or herbs for chronic hepatitis B Review question To assess the benefits and harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other medicines or herbs in people with chronic hepatitis B. Background Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common liver disease, associated with high morbidity (illness) and death. It causes psychological stress and is a burden to people with chronic hepatitis B and their families. Radix Sophorae flavescentis is for treating people with chronic hepatitis B as it is believed that it decreases discomfort and prevents the replication of the virus in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, the benefits and harms are still unclear. Search date We searched scientific databases in December 2018. Study characteristics We included 10 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 898 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias. The trials covered oral capsules, intravenous (into a vein) infusion, intramuscular (into a muscle) injection, and acupoint (a specifically chosen site of acupuncture) injection of Radix Sophorae flavescentis with treatment duration from 1 month to 12 months. Radix Sophorae flavescentis was compared with lamivudine, adefovir, interferon, tiopronin, thymosin, and other Chinese herbs. Two trials included children up to 14 years old. Participants in one trial had cirrhosis (late stage of scarring of the liver) in chronic hepatitis B. Study funding sources Two of the 10 trials were not funded, and one received governmental funding. The remaining seven trials provided no information on funding. Undisclosed funding may have influence on trial results and lead to poor design of the trial. Key results None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), or followed people who have died from any reason or died from hepatitis B, or who were at risk of dying because of hepatitis B. Side effects considered 'not to be serious' was an outcome in two trials. We could not say if Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other medicines or herbs was better or worse regarding the occurrence of side effects considered 'not to be serious'. We were uncertain whether Radix Sophorae flavescentis had a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the proportion of participants with detectable HBV‐DNA (the genetic blueprint of the virus). Radix Sophorae flavescentis may have reduced the proportion of participants with detectable hepatitis B virus e‐antigen (HBeAg; produced by the immune system). However, caution is needed with these findings as the trials providing data on them were small, at high risk of bias, and these outcomes have not yet been proven relevant to people with HBV infection. We identified 109 trials that not be included because of lack of information required for the conduct of this review. Accordingly, more information from properly designed randomised clinical trials is needed before one can determine the benefits or harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis for people with chronic hepatitis B. Certainty of the evidence Certainty of evidence means 'the extent of one's confidence that review results are correct in supporting or rejecting a finding.' The certainty of the evidence on the use of Radix Sophorae flavescentis in people with chronic HBV in terms of its beneficial or harmful effects on death, health‐related quality of life, risk of dying due to HBV infection, and serious side effects cannot be determined as none of the trials reported patient‐relevant outcomes. Our certainty in the evidence that Radix Sophorae flavescentis, when compared with other medicines or herbs, would decrease or increase side effects considered 'not to be serious' and number of people with detectable HBV‐DNA is very low. Our certainty in the evidence that Radix Sophorae flavescentis decreases the number of people with detectable HBeAg is also very low. These assessments of certainty of evidence are due to the poor design and reporting of the included trials.",CD013106
"Background Frequent consumption of excess amounts of sugar‐sweetened beverages (SSB) is a risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dental caries. Environmental interventions, i.e. interventions that alter the physical or social environment in which individuals make beverage choices, have been advocated as a means to reduce the consumption of SSB. Objectives To assess the effects of environmental interventions (excluding taxation) on the consumption of sugar‐sweetened beverages and sugar‐sweetened milk, diet‐related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, and on any reported unintended consequences or adverse outcomes. Search methods We searched 11 general, specialist and regional databases from inception to 24 January 2018. We also searched trial registers, reference lists and citations, scanned websites of relevant organisations, and contacted study authors. Selection criteria We included studies on interventions implemented at an environmental level, reporting effects on direct or indirect measures of SSB intake, diet‐related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, or any reported adverse outcome. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐after (CBA) and interrupted‐time‐series (ITS) studies, implemented in real‐world settings with a combined length of intervention and follow‐up of at least 12 weeks and at least 20 individuals in each of the intervention and control groups. We excluded studies in which participants were administered SSB as part of clinical trials, and multicomponent interventions which did not report SSB‐specific outcome data. We excluded studies on the taxation of SSB, as these are the subject of a separate Cochrane Review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies. We classified interventions according to the NOURISHING framework, and synthesised results narratively and conducted meta‐analyses for two outcomes relating to two intervention types. We assessed our confidence in the certainty of effect estimates with the GRADE framework as very low, low, moderate or high, and presented ‘Summary of findings’ tables. Main results We identified 14,488 unique records, and assessed 1030 in full text for eligibility. We found 58 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, including 22 RCTs, 3 NRCTs, 14 CBA studies, and 19 ITS studies, with a total of 1,180,096 participants. The median length of follow‐up was 10 months. The studies included children, teenagers and adults, and were implemented in a variety of settings, including schools, retailing and food service establishments. We judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, and most studies used non‐randomised designs. The studies examine a broad range of interventions, and we present results for these separately. Labelling interventions  (8 studies): We found moderate‐certainty evidence that traffic‐light labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs, and low‐certainty evidence that nutritional rating score labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs. For menu‐board calorie labelling reported effects on SSB sales varied. Nutrition standards in public institutions  (16 studies): We found low‐certainty evidence that reduced availability of SSBs in schools is associated with decreased SSB consumption. We found very low‐certainty evidence that improved availability of drinking water in schools and school fruit programmes are associated with decreased SSB consumption. Reported associations between improved availability of drinking water in schools and student body weight varied. Economic tools  (7 studies): We found moderate‐certainty evidence that price increases on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. For price discounts on low‐calorie beverages reported effects on SSB sales varied. Whole food supply interventions  (3 studies): Reported associations between voluntary industry initiatives to improve the whole food supply and SSB sales varied. Retail and food service interventions  (7 studies): We found low‐certainty evidence that healthier default beverages in children’s menus in chain restaurants are associated with decreasing SSB sales, and moderate‐certainty evidence that in‐store promotion of healthier beverages in supermarkets is associated with decreasing SSB sales. We found very low‐certainty evidence that urban planning restrictions on new fast‐food restaurants and restrictions on the number of stores selling SSBs in remote communities are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between promotion of healthier beverages in vending machines and SSB intake or sales varied. Intersectoral approaches  (8 studies): We found moderate‐certainty evidence that government food benefit programmes with restrictions on purchasing SSBs are associated with decreased SSB intake. For unrestricted food benefit programmes reported effects varied. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that multicomponent community campaigns focused on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between trade and investment liberalisation and SSB sales varied. Home‐based interventions  (7 studies): We found moderate‐certainty evidence that improved availability of low‐calorie beverages in the home environment is associated with decreased SSB intake, and high‐certainty evidence that it is associated with decreased body weight among adolescents with overweight or obesity and a high baseline consumption of SSBs. Adverse outcomes reported by studies, which may occur in some circumstances, included negative effects on revenue, compensatory SSB consumption outside school when the availability of SSBs in schools is reduced, reduced milk intake, stakeholder discontent, and increased total energy content of grocery purchases with price discounts on low‐calorie beverages, among others. The certainty of evidence on adverse outcomes was low to very low for most outcomes. We analysed interventions targeting sugar‐sweetened milk separately, and found low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that emoticon labelling and small prizes for the selection of healthier beverages in elementary school cafeterias are associated with decreased consumption of sugar‐sweetened milk. We found low‐certainty evidence that improved placement of plain milk in school cafeterias is not associated with decreasing sugar‐sweetened milk consumption. Authors' conclusions The evidence included in this review indicates that effective, scalable interventions addressing SSB consumption at a population level exist. Implementation should be accompanied by high‐quality evaluations using appropriate study designs, with a particular focus on the long‐term effects of approaches suitable for large‐scale implementation.","Cutting back on sugar‐sweetened beverages: What works? What are sugar‐sweetened beverages? Sugar‐sweetened beverages (SSBs) are cold and hot drinks with added sugar. Common SSBs are non‐diet soft drinks, regular soda, iced tea, sports drinks, energy drinks, fruit punches, sweetened waters, and sweetened tea and coffee. Why are SSBs an important health topic? Research shows that people who drink a lot of SSBs often gain weight. Drinking a lot of SSBs can also increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and dental decay. Doctors therefore recommend that children, teenagers and adults drink fewer SSBs. Governments, businesses, schools and workplaces have taken various measures to support healthier beverage choices. What is the aim of this review? We wanted to find out whether the measures taken so far have been successful in helping people to drink fewer SSBs to improve their health. We focused on measures that change the environment in which people make beverage choices. We did not look at studies on educational programmes or on SSB taxes, as these are examined in separate reviews. (We did, however, examine price increases on SSB which were not due to taxes.) We searched for all available studies meeting clearly‐defined criteria to answer this question. This review reflects the state of the evidence up until January 2018. What studies did we find? We found 58 studies, which included more than one million adults, teenagers and children. Most studies lasted about one year, and were done in schools, stores or restaurants. Some studies used methods that are not very reliable. For example, in some studies participants were simply asked how much SSB they drank, which is not very reliable, as people sometimes forget how much SSB they drank. Some of the findings of our review may therefore change when more and better studies become available. What do these studies tell us? We have found some evidence that some of the measures implemented to help people drink fewer SSBs have been successful, including the following: ▪ Labels which are easy to understand, such as traffic‐light labels, and labels which rate the healthfulness of beverages with stars or numbers. ▪ Limits to the availability of SSB in schools (e.g. replacing SSBs with water in school cafeterias). ▪ Price increases on SSBs in restaurants, stores and leisure centres. ▪ Children’s menus in chain restaurants which include healthier beverages as their standard beverage. ▪ Promotion of healthier beverages in supermarkets. ▪ Government food benefits (e.g. food stamps) which cannot be used to buy SSBs. ▪ Community campaigns focused on SSBs. ▪ Measures that improve the availability of low‐calorie beverages at home, e.g. through home deliveries of bottled water and diet beverages. We have also found some evidence that improved availability of drinking water and diet beverages at home can help people lose weight. There are also other measures which may influence how much SSB people drink, but for these the available evidence is less certain. Some, but not all studies found that such measures can have effects which were not intended and which may be negative. Some studies reported that profits of stores and restaurants decreased when the measures were implemented, but other studies showed that profits increased or stayed the same. Children who get free drinking water in schools may drink less milk. Some studies reported that people were unhappy with the measures. We also looked at studies on sugar‐sweetened milk. We found that small prizes for children who chose plain milk in their school cafeteria, as well as emoticon labels, may help children drink less sugar‐sweetened milk. However, this may also drive up the share of milk which is wasted because children choose but do not drink it. What does this mean in practice? Our review shows that measures which change the environment in which people make beverage choices can help people drink less SSB. Based on our findings we suggest that such measures may be used more widely. Government officials, business people and health professionals implementing such measures should work together with researchers to find out more about their effects in the short and long term.",CD012292
"Background This is the second substantive update of this review. It was originally published in 1998 and was previously updated in 2009. Elevated blood pressure (known as 'hypertension') increases with age ‐ most rapidly over age 60. Systolic hypertension is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than is diastolic hypertension, and it occurs more commonly in older people. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and people 80 years or older. Objectives Primary objective • To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all‐cause mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension Secondary objectives • To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular‐specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension • To quantify the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension Search methods The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to 24 November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for adult patients (≥ 60 years old) with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. Data collection and analysis Outcomes assessed were all‐cause mortality; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality; and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We modified the definition of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to exclude transient ischaemic attacks when possible. Main results This update includes one additional trial ( MRC‐TMH 1985 ). Sixteen trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.4 years) from western industrialised countries with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first‐line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years. Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all‐cause mortality (high‐certainty evidence; 11% with control vs 10.0% with treatment; risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.97; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (moderate‐certainty evidence; 13.6% with control vs 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (moderate‐certainty evidence; 5.2% with control vs 3.4% with treatment; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (moderate‐certainty evidence; 4.8% with control vs 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with treatment (low‐certainty evidence; 5.4% with control vs 15.7% with treatment; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30. In the three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. This comprehensive systematic review provides additional evidence that the reduction in mortality observed was due mostly to reduction in the 60‐ to 79‐year‐old patient subgroup (high‐certainty evidence; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95). Although cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was significantly reduced in both subgroups 60 to 79 years old (moderate‐certainty evidence; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.77) and 80 years or older (moderate‐certainty evidence; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87), the magnitude of absolute risk reduction was probably higher among 60‐ to 79‐year‐old patients (3.8% vs 2.9%). The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was primarily due to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Authors' conclusions Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most evidence of benefit pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first‐line treatment.","Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older Review question This is the second update of this review, first published in 1998 and first updated in 2009. We wanted to study the benefits and harms of using blood pressure‐lowering drugs in adults 60 years or older with raised blood pressure. Search date We searched the available medical literature to find all trials that compared drug treatment versus placebo or no treatment to examine this question. Data included in this review are up‐to‐date as of November 2017. Background High blood pressure, which is common among elderly people 60 years or older, increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Study characteristics We found 16 studies that randomly assigned 26,795 patients 60 years or older with high blood pressure to antihypertensive drug therapy or to placebo or untreated control for a mean duration of 4.5 years. Key results Blood pressure‐lowering drug therapy in people with hypertension 60 years and older reduced death, strokes, and heart attacks. Benefit was similar if both upper and lower blood pressure numbers were elevated and if only the upper number was elevated. First‐line treatment used in most studies was a thiazide. More patients withdrew from the studies owing to side effects of these drugs. The magnitude of benefit in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity observed was probably greater among 60‐ to 79‐year‐old patients than in very elderly patients 80 years or older. Conclusions Blood pressure‐lowering drug treatment for healthy persons (60 years or older) with raised blood pressure reduces death, heart attacks, and strokes. Quality of evidence Review authors graded the quality of evidence as high for reduction in death and as moderate for reduction in stroke and heart attacks.",CD000028
"Background Post‐surgical hypoparathyroidism is a common complication after thyroid surgery. The incidence is likely to increase given the rising trend in the annual number of thyroid operations being performed. Measures to prevent post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism including different surgical techniques and prophylactic calcium and vitamin D supplements have been extensively studied. The management of post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism however has not been extensively evaluated. Routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the postoperative period may reduce the risk of symptoms, temporary hypocalcaemia and hospital stay. However, this may lead to overtreatment and has no effect on long‐term hypoparathyroidism. Current recommendations on the management of post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is based on low‐quality evidence. Existing guidelines do not often distinguish between surgical and non‐surgical hypoparathyroidism, and transient and long‐term disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the use of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In addition, we aimed to highlight deficiencies in the current literature and stimulate further work in this field. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in managing post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase as well as ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search for all databases was 17 December 2018 (except Embase, which was last searched on 21 December 2017). No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised control trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) examining the effects of calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone in people with temporary and long‐term post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for relevance. Main results Database searches yielded a total of 1751 records. We retrieved potentially relevant full texts and excluded articles on the following basis: not a RCT or CCT; intervention, comparator or both did not match prespecified criteria; non‐surgical causes of hypoparathyroidism, and studies on prevention. None of the articles was eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Authors' conclusions This systematic review highlights a gap in the current literature and the lack of high‐quality evidence in the management of post‐thyroidectomy temporary and long‐term hypoparathyroidism. Further research focusing on clinically relevant outcomes is needed to examine the effects of current treatments in the management of temporary and long‐term post‐thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia.","Calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone for managing post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism Review question What are the effects of calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in the management of low parathyroid hormone following thyroid surgery? Background The parathyroid glands are four small glands attached to the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone which regulates blood calcium levels. These glands may be accidentally damaged during surgery, for example after removal of the thyroid gland. The consequence of this is low blood calcium levels. The damage to the parathyroid glands may be temporary or long term. The use of calcium and vitamin D supplements to normalise the blood calcium level is the mainstay of treatment in these people but the precise nature, dose and duration of these treatments vary across centres. Recent studies suggest the use of laboratory‐engineered (recombinant) parathyroid hormone as a treatment option. Current guidelines on the management of post‐thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism are based on low‐quality evidence. We aimed to review high‐quality research evaluating the use of calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in this condition. In addition, we aimed to highlight gaps in the current literature and to stimulate further clinical studies in this field. Study characteristics We found no relevant randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) or controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of calcium, vitamin D supplements and parathyroid hormone in this condition. This evidence is up to date as of 17 December 2018. Key results Lack of high‐quality evidence on the use of calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in the management of low parathyroid hormone after thyroid surgery. Certainty of the evidence We could not critically appraise the certainty of the evidence because we did not identify studies matching our inclusion criteria.",CD012845
"Background One nutritional intervention advocated to prevent malnutrition among children is lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS). LNS provide a range of vitamins and minerals, but unlike most other micronutrient supplements, LNS also provide energy, protein and essential fatty acids. Alternative recipes and formulations to LNS include fortified blended foods (FBF), which are foods fortified with vitamins and minerals, and micronutrient powders (MNP), which are a combination of vitamins and minerals, Objectives To assess the effects and safety of preventive LNS given with complementary foods on health, nutrition and developmental outcomes of non‐hospitalised infants and children six to 23 months of age, and whether or not they are more effective than other foods (including FBF or MNP). This review did not assess the effects of LNS as supplementary foods or therapeutic foods in the management of moderate and severe acute malnutrition. Search methods In October 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 21 other databases and two trials registers for relevant studies. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews and contacted the authors of studies and other experts in the area for any ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that evaluated the impact of LNS plus complementary foods given at point‐of‐use (for any dose, frequency, duration) to non‐hospitalised infants and young children aged six to 23 months in stable or emergency settings and compared to no intervention, other supplementary foods (i.e. FBF), nutrition counselling or multiple micronutrient supplements or powders for point‐of‐use fortification of complementary foods. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies for relevance and, for those studies included in the review, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software. We used a random‐effects meta‐analysis for combining data as the interventions differed significantly. We set out the main findings of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables,. Main results Our search identified a total of 8124 records, from which we included 17 studies (54 papers) with 23,200 children in the review. The included studies reported on one or more of the pre‐specified primary outcomes, and five studies included multiple comparison groups. Overall, the majority of trials were at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. Using the GRADE approach, we judged the quality of the evidence for most outcomes as low or moderate. LNS+complementary feeding compared with no intervention  Thirteen studies compared LNS plus complementary feeding with no intervention. LNS plus complementary feeding reduced the prevalence of moderate stunting by 7% (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.98; nine studies, 13,372 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), severe stunting by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; five studies, 6151 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), moderate wasting by 18% (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; eight studies; 13,172 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), moderate underweight by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.91; eight studies, 13,073 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and anaemia by 21% (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; five studies, 2332 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no impact of LNS plus complementary feeding on severe wasting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.46; three studies, 2329 participants) and severe underweight (RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.13; two studies, 1729 participants). Adverse effects did not differ between the groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01; three studies, 3382 participants). LNS+complementary feeding compared with FBF  Five studies compared LNS plus complementary feeding with other FBF, including corn soy blend and UNIMIX. We pooled four of the five studies in meta‐analyses and found that, when compared to other FBF, LNS plus complementary feeding significantly reduced the prevalence of moderate stunting (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; three studies, 2828 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), moderate wasting (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; two studies, 2290 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and moderate underweight (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.91; two studies, 2280 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). We found no difference between LNS plus complementary feeding and FBF for severe stunting (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.42; two studies, 729 participants; low‐quality evidence), severe wasting (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.81; two studies, 735 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and severe underweight (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.25; one study, 173 participants; low‐quality evidence). LNS+complementary feeding compared with MNP  Four studies compared LNS plus complementary feeding with MNP. We pooled data from three of the four studies in meta‐analyses and found that compared to MNP, LNS plus complementary feeding significantly reduced the prevalence of moderate underweight (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; two studies, 2004 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and anaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68; two studies, 557 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between LNS plus complementary feeding and MNP for moderate stunting (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; three studies, 2365 participants) and moderate wasting (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; two studies, 2004 participants). Authors' conclusions The findings of this review suggest that LNS plus complementary feeding compared to no intervention is effective at improving growth outcomes and anaemia without adverse effects among children aged six to 23 months in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC) in Asia and Africa, and more effective if provided over a longer duration of time (over 12 months). Limited evidence also suggests that LNS plus complementary feeding is more effective than FBF and MNP at improving growth outcomes.","Effect of lipid‐based nutrient supplementation on infants and young children Review question What is the impact of lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) plus complementary foods on health, nutrition and developmental outcomes among infants and young children? Background LNS are food products which contain energy, minerals and vitamins that can improve growth in children. LNS provide vitamins, minerals and energy in the form of protein and essential fatty acids. We sought to assess the effect of LNS given jointly with complementary feeding, compared to no intervention, micronutrient powders (MNP; a mixture of vitamins and minerals that is sprinkled onto food) and other fortified blended food (FBF) products in healthy children. Study characteristics This review includes 17 studies (from 54 reports) with 23,200 children. Four of the included studies were conducted in Malawi, three in Bangladesh, two in Ghana and one each in Burkina Faso, Haiti, Honduras, Chad, Congo, Kenya, Niger, Peru, Guatemala, and Indonesia. Four included studies enrolled pregnant women and provided LNS plus complementary feeding during pregnancy and post‐partum, followed by infant supplementation starting at six months of age. The other studies provided LNS plus complementary feeding to children after six months of age. None of the included studies were conducted in emergency settings. Key results Findings of this review suggest that LNS plus complementary feeding is probably an effective intervention for improving growth outcomes and reducing the occurrence of children who are of short stature for their age (stunting), have low weight for their age (moderate underweight), have low weight for their height (moderate wasting) and anaemia. Additionally, LNS plus complementary feeding probably improves height and weight for age as well as mid‐upper arm circumference without adverse effects among children aged six to 23 months. The intervention seems to be more effective if provided for a duration longer than 12 months. Evidence also suggests that LNS plus complementary probably reduces moderate stunting, moderate wasting and moderate underweight, compared to other FBF. Furthermore, LNS plus complementary feeding is probably more effective than MNP at reducing moderate underweight and improving height and weight. Quality of evidence Overall, we considered most studies to be at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of intervention. We rated the quality of the evidence for most outcomes as either low or moderate. Currentness of evidence The evidence is current to October 2018.",CD012611
"Background Neuroblastoma is a rare malignant disease that primarily affects children. The tumours mainly develop in the adrenal medullary tissue, and an abdominal mass is the most common presentation. High‐risk disease is characterised by metastasis and other primary tumour characteristics resulting in increased risk for an adverse outcome. The GD2 carbohydrate antigen is expressed on the cell surface of neuroblastoma tumour cells and is thus a promising target for anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing immunotherapy. Objectives To assess the efficacy of anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing postconsolidation immunotherapy after high‐dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) compared to standard therapy after HDCT and autologous HSCT in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related mortality. Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, event‐free survival, early toxicity, late non‐haematological toxicity, and health‐related quality of life. Search methods We searched the electronic databases CENTRAL (2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) on 20 September 2018. We searched trial registries and conference proceedings on 28 October 2018. Further searches included reference lists of recent reviews and relevant articles as well as contacting experts in the field. There were no limits on publication year or language. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing immunotherapy after HDCT and autologous HSCT in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, abstracted data on study and participant characteristics, and assessed risk of bias and GRADE. Any differences were resolved by discussion, with third‐party arbitration unnecessary. We performed analyses according to the guidelines of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We used the five GRADE considerations, that is study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias, to judge the quality of the evidence. Main results We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 226 people with high‐risk neuroblastoma who were pre‐treated with autologous HSCT. The study randomised 113 participants to receive immunotherapy including isotretinoin, granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), interleukin‐2, and ch14.18, a type of anti‐GD2 antibody also known as dinutuximab. The study randomised another 113 participants to receive standard therapy including isotretinoin. The results on overall survival favoured the dinutuximab‐containing immunotherapy group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.80; P = 0.004). The results on event‐free survival also favoured the dinutuximab‐containing immunotherapy group (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.92; P = 0.020). Randomised data on adverse events were not reported separately. The study did not report progression‐free survival, late non‐haematological toxicity, and health‐related quality of life as separate endpoints. We graded the quality of the evidence as moderate. Authors' conclusions The evidence base favours dinutuximab‐containing immunotherapy compared to standard therapy concerning overall survival and event‐free survival in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma pre‐treated with autologous HSCT. Randomised data on adverse events are lacking, therefore more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made regarding this outcome.","Anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing immunotherapy for people with high‐risk neuroblastoma treated with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation Review question We searched for studies of people with high‐risk neuroblastoma who received high‐dose chemotherapy (which kills stem cells) followed by autologous (from the same person) haematopoietic stem cell (blood cell precursors) transplantation (to rescue and replace the killed stem cells). We reviewed the evidence concerning the effect of anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing immunotherapy compared to standard therapy in such people on overall survival, treatment‐related death, progression‐free survival, event‐free survival, early toxicity, late non‐haematological toxicity, and health‐related quality of life. Background Neuroblastoma is a rare form of cancer that primarily affects children. High‐risk disease is characterised by metastasis at diagnosis and other primary tumour characteristics resulting in increased risk for an poor outcome. The GD2 carbohydrate antigen is expressed on the cell surface of neuroblastoma tumour cells and is thus a promising target for anti‐GD2 antibody‐containing immunotherapy. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 20 September 2018. We included a single randomised trial (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with 113 people allocated to immunotherapy including isotretinoin, granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), interleukin‐2, and ch14.18, a distinct type of anti‐GD2 antibody also known as dinutuximab. Another 113 people were allocated to receive standard therapy including isotretinoin. Key results The results on overall survival and event‐free survival favoured the dinutuximab‐containing immunotherapy group. Other outcomes including those on adverse events were not adequately reported; more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made regarding these outcomes. Quality of the evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate.",CD012442
"Background Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long‐term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) ’s Specialised Register of dementia trials ( dementia.cochrane.org/our‐trials‐register ), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost‐related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster‐RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non‐pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration‐based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12‐month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant‐months; low‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness). Authors' conclusions Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software‐based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist‐led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non‐pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence‐based care for this vulnerable group.","Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care (LTC) Review question How effective are treatments to prevent delirium in older people living in long‐term care (LTC)? Background LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and help with day‐to‐day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24‐hour nursing care. Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC. Delirium is a condition that causes confusion, usually over a few hours or days. Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy while others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition. Delirium can increase the chances of being admitted to hospital, developing dementia and can increase the risk of death. Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main delirium risk factors, including, providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; and avoiding certain medications which increase the risk of delirium. This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC. Study characteristics The evidence is current to February 2019. We found three studies that included 3851 participants. Two studies took place in the US and one study in the UK. One study tested whether delirium could be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring hydration was maintained. There were 98 people in the study, which lasted four weeks. One study tested the effect of a computer program which searched for prescriptions of medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium, to enable a pharmacist to adjust or stop them. There were 3538 people in the study, which lasted 12 months. One study tested an enhanced educational intervention which included learning sessions on delirium with care home staff and group meetings to identity targets for preventing delirium. There were 215 people in the study, which lasted 16 months. Key findings It was not possible to determine if the hydration intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium. This was a small study of short duration with serious design problems. The study of a computerised medication search programme probably reduced delirium, but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. A potential problem is that it might not be possible to use this computer program in different countries that do not have similar computer systems available. It was not possible to determine if the enhanced education intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium and there was no clear reduction in the number of deaths. The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions. This is based on findings from a small study. Quality of the evidence There is very low‐quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme may reduce the incidence of delirium. There is no clear evidence for reducing hospitalisations, mortality or falls. There is very low‐quality evidence of the effectiveness of an enhanced educational intervention for reducing delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence for reducing hospital admissions. As this review only found a small number of research studies, we recommend that further research be conducted, testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people in LTC.",CD009537
"Background High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this, the third of a series of three reviews about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in people who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in January 2019. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references to additional trials. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting where non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions were employed to prevent acute HAI, including preacclimatization measures and the administration of non‐pharmacological supplements. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included participants with, and without, a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant intervention was administered before the beginning of ascent. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures employed by Cochrane. Main results We included 20 studies (1406 participants, 21 references) in this review. Thirty studies (14 ongoing, and 16 pending classification (awaiting)) will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. We report the results for the primary outcome of this review (risk of AMS) by each group of assessed interventions. Group 1. Preacclimatization and other measures based on pressure Use of simulated altitude or remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) might not improve the risk of AMS on subsequent exposure to altitude, but this effect is uncertain (simulated altitude: risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.71; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence. RIPC: RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.69 to 13.12; 1 trial, 40 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk using positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP), but this information was derived from a cross‐over trial with a limited number of participants (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.76; 1 trial, 8 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. Group 2. Supplements and vitamins Supplementation of antioxidants, medroxyprogesterone, iron or  Rhodiola crenulata  might not improve the risk of AMS on exposure to high altitude, but this effect is uncertain (antioxidants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03; 1 trial, 18 participants; low‐quality evidence. Medroxyprogesterone: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 32 participants; low‐quality evidence. Iron: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 65 participants; low‐quality evidence.  R crenulata : RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 1 trial, 125 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk with the administration of erythropoietin, but this information was extracted from a trial with issues related to risk of bias and imprecision (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84; 1 trial, 39 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Regarding administration of ginkgo biloba, we did not perform a pooled estimation of RR for AMS due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies (I² = 65%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (from 0.05 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. Group 3. Other comparisons We found heterogeneous evidence regarding the risk of AMS when ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide (I² = 63%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (estimations from 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.86) to 2.97 (95% CI 1.70 to 5.21); low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement when ginkgo biloba was administered along with acetazolamide, but this information was derived from a single trial with issues associated to risk of bias (compared to ginkgo biloba alone: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; 1 trial, 311 participants; low‐quality evidence). Administration of medroxyprogesterone plus acetazolamide did not improve the risk of AMS when compared to administration of medroxyprogesterone or acetazolamide alone (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.55; 1 trial, 12 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. Authors' conclusions This Cochrane Review is the final in a series of three providing relevant information to clinicians, and other interested parties, on how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions suggests that there is heterogeneous and even contradictory evidence related to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. Safety of these interventions remains as an unclear issue due to lack of assessment. Overall, the evidence is limited due to its quality (low to very low), the relative paucity of that evidence and the number of studies pending classification for the three reviews belonging to this series (30 studies either awaiting classification or ongoing). Additional studies, especially those comparing with pharmacological alternatives (such as acetazolamide) are required, in order to establish or refute the strategies evaluated in this review.","Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness Background The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. Study characteristics The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. Key results The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI.",CD013315
"Background Rapid and accurate detection of stroke by paramedics or other emergency clinicians at the time of first contact is crucial for timely initiation of appropriate treatment. Several stroke recognition scales have been developed to support the initial triage. However, their accuracy remains uncertain and there is no agreement which of the scales perform better. Objectives To systematically identify and review the evidence pertaining to the test accuracy of validated stroke recognition scales, as used in a prehospital or emergency room (ER) setting to screen people suspected of having stroke. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and the Science Citation Index to 30 January 2018. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data. Selection criteria We included studies evaluating the accuracy of stroke recognition scales used in a prehospital or ER setting to identify stroke and transient Ischemic attack (TIA) in people suspected of stroke. The scales had to be applied to actual people and the results compared to a final diagnosis of stroke or TIA. We excluded studies that applied scales to patient records; enrolled only screen‐positive participants and without complete 2 × 2 data. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently conducted a two‐stage screening of all publications identified by the searches, extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies using a tailored version of QUADAS‐2. A third review author acted as an arbiter. We recalculated study‐level sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and presented them in forest plots and in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space. When a sufficient number of studies reported the accuracy of the test in the same setting (prehospital or ER) and the level of heterogeneity was relatively low, we pooled the results using the bivariate random‐effects model. We plotted the results in the summary ROC (SROC) space presenting an estimate point (mean sensitivity and specificity) with 95% CI and prediction regions. Because of the small number of studies, we did not conduct meta‐regression to investigate between‐study heterogeneity and the relative accuracy of the scales. Instead, we summarized the results in tables and diagrams, and presented our findings narratively. Main results We selected 23 studies for inclusion (22 journal articles and one conference abstract). We evaluated the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared the accuracy of two or more scales. We considered 12 studies at high risk of bias and one with applicability concerns in the patient selection domain; 14 at unclear risk of bias and one with applicability concerns in the reference standard domain; and the risk of bias in the flow and timing domain was high in one study and unclear in another 16. We pooled the results from five studies evaluating ROSIER in the ER and five studies evaluating LAPSS in a prehospital setting. The studies included in the meta‐analysis of ROSIER were of relatively good methodologic quality and produced a summary sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), with the prediction interval ranging from approximately 0.75 to 0.95. This means that the test will miss on average 12% of people with stroke/TIA which, depending on the circumstances, could range from 5% to 25%. We could not obtain a reliable summary estimate of specificity due to extreme heterogeneity in study‐level results. The summary sensitivity of LAPSS was 0.83 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.89) and summary specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.96). However, we were uncertain in the validity of these results as four of the studies were at high and one at uncertain risk of bias. We did not report summary estimates for the rest of the scales, as the number of studies per test per setting was small, the risk of bias was high or uncertain, the results were highly heterogenous, or a combination of these. Studies comparing two or more scales in the same participants reported that ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy when used in the ER. In the field, CPSS was more sensitive than MedPACS and LAPSS, but had similar sensitivity to that of MASS; and MASS was more sensitive than LAPSS. In contrast, MASS, ROSIER and MedPACS were more specific than CPSS; and the difference in the specificities of MASS and LAPSS was not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions In the field, CPSS had consistently the highest sensitivity and, therefore, should be preferred to other scales. Further evidence is needed to determine its absolute accuracy and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead, to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice, as it was evaluated in more studies than FAST and showed consistently high sensitivity. In a cohort of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). We were unable to obtain an estimate of its summary specificity. Because of the small number of studies per test per setting, high risk of bias, substantial differences in study characteristics and large between‐study heterogeneity, these findings should be treated as provisional hypotheses that need further verification in better‐designed studies.","Accuracy of prehospital stroke scales to identify people with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) Background Stroke is a life‐threatening medical condition in which brain tissue is damaged. This could be caused by a clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain or bleeding in the brain. If symptoms resolve within 24 hours without lasting consequences, the condition is called TIA (mini stroke). Effective treatment depends on early identification of stroke and any delays may result in brain damage or death. Emergency medical services are the first point of contact for people experiencing symptoms suggestive of stroke. Medical responders could identify people with stroke more accurately if they use checklists called stroke recognition scales. Such scales include symptoms and other readily‐available information. A positive result on the scale indicates high risk of stroke and the need of urgent specialist assessment. The scales do not differentiate between stroke and TIA; this is done in hospital by a neurologist or stroke physician. Our objective was to review the research evidence on how accurately stroke recognition scales can detect stroke or TIA when used by paramedics or other prehospital clinicians, who are the first point of contact for people suspected of stroke. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 30 January 2018. We included studies assessing the accuracy of stroke recognition scales when applied to adults suspected of stroke out of hospital. We included 23 studies evaluating the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared two or more scales in the same people. The results from five studies were combined to estimate the accuracy of ROSIER in the emergency room (ER) and five studies to estimate the accuracy of LAPSS when used by ambulance clinicians. Quality of the evidence Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality and we could not be sure that their results were valid. Key results of the accuracy of the evaluated prehospital stroke scales Studies differed considerably in terms of included participants and other characteristics. As a consequence, studies evaluating the same scale reported variable results. We combined five studies evaluating ROSIER in the ER and obtained average sensitivity of 88% (88 out of 100 people with stroke/TIA will test positive on ROSIER). We were unable to obtain an estimate of specificity (how many people without stroke/TIA will test negative). We also combined the results for LAPSS, but the included studies were of poor quality and the results may not be valid. The rest of the scales were evaluated in a smaller number of studies or the results were too variable to be combined statistically. A small number of studies compared two or more scales when applied to the same participants. Such studies are more likely to produce valid results as the scales are used in the same circumstances. They reported that in the ER, ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy, but ROSIER was evaluated in more studies. When used by ambulance staff, CPSS identified more people with stroke/TIA in all studies, but also more people without stroke/TIA tested positive. Conclusion Current evidence suggests that CPSS should be used by ambulance clinicians in the field. Further research is needed to estimate the proportion of wrong results and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice. In a group of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). Because of the small number of studies evaluating the tests in a specific setting, poor quality, substantial differences in study characteristics and variability in results, these findings should be treated with caution and need further verification in better‐designed studies.",CD011427
"Background Non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been used to treat respiratory distress due to acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (ACPE). We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis update on NPPV for adults presenting with ACPE. Objectives To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NPPV compared to standard medical care (SMC) for adults with ACPE. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Important secondary outcomes were endotracheal intubation, treatment intolerance, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, rates of acute myocardial infarction, and adverse event rates. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (CRS Web, 20 September 2018), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 19 September 2018), Embase (Ovid, 1974 to 19 September 2018), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO, 1937 to 19 September 2018), LILACS, WHO ICTRP, and clinicaltrials.gov. We also reviewed reference lists of included studies. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included blinded or unblinded randomised controlled trials in adults with ACPE. Participants had to be randomised to NPPV (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) plus standard medical care (SMC) compared with SMC alone. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened and selected articles for inclusion. We extracted data with a standardised data collection form. We evaluated the risks of bias of each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed evidence quality for each outcome using the GRADE recommendations. Main results We included 24 studies (2664 participants) of adult participants (older than 18 years of age) with respiratory distress due to ACPE, not requiring immediate mechanical ventilation. People with ACPE presented either to an Emergency Department or were inpatients. ACPE treatment was provided in an intensive care or Emergency Department setting. There was a median follow‐up of 13 days for hospital mortality, one day for endotracheal intubation, and three days for acute myocardial infarction. Compared with SMC, NPPV may reduce hospital mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.82; participants = 2484; studies = 21; I 2  = 6%; low quality of evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17 (NNTB 12 to 32). NPPV probably reduces endotracheal intubation rates (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.62; participants = 2449; studies = 20; I 2  = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) with a NNTB of 13 (NNTB 11 to 18). There is probably little or no difference in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence with NPPV compared to SMC for ACPE (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16; participants = 1313; studies = 5; I 2  = 0%; moderate quality of evidence). We are uncertain as to whether NPPV increases hospital length of stay (mean difference (MD) −0.31 days, 95% CI −1.23 to 0.61; participants = 1714; studies = 11; I 2  = 55%; very low quality of evidence). Adverse events were generally similar between NPPV and SMC groups, but evidence was of low quality. Authors' conclusions Our review provides support for continued clinical application of NPPV for ACPE, to improve outcomes such as hospital mortality and intubation rates. NPPV is a safe intervention with similar adverse event rates to SMC alone. Additional research is needed to determine if specific subgroups of people with ACPE have greater benefit of NPPV compared to SMC. Future research should explore the benefit of NPPV for ACPE patients with hypercapnia.","A breathing intervention for shortness of breath due to heart failure Background Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospital admission in the world. People with heart failure often experience shortness of breath and leg swelling. These symptoms may develop over hours to weeks, or rapidly over a few hours. Such rapid deterioration is called acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Providing air under pressure through a face or nose mask can treat shortness of breath. This treatment is called non‐invasive ventilation and its use in heart failure is controversial. Study characteristics Randomised controlled studies compare treatments to find out if they are truly effective. We searched for randomised studies comparing non‐invasive ventilation to routine care for adults with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We compared studies treating people with non‐invasive ventilation versus medical care. Medical care includes therapies such as providing extra oxygen and water pills to patients. The evidence upon which this review is based is current to September 2018. Review question We sought to address if non‐invasive ventilation in adults with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema reduces rates of deaths, the need for a breathing tube, and heart attacks. Key results and quality of evidence We found 24 studies with 2664 participants comparing non‐invasive ventilation to medical care alone. Non‐invasive ventilation may decrease the chances of dying in hospital. The quality of results for studies reporting death in hospital was low. Studies were poorly conducted, and results were not similar across studies. In addition, non‐invasive ventilation probably reduces the chances of needing a breathing tube. The quality of results for studies reporting breathing tube rates was moderate. Studies evaluating breathing tube rates were poorly conducted. Non‐invasive ventilation probably has little or no effect on getting a heart attack. The quality of results for studies reporting heart attack rates was moderate, and studies had inconsistent results for this outcome. We are unsure if the length of hospital stay is improved with non‐invasive ventilation. The quality of results for studies reporting hospital length of stay was very low, which was due to poor study conduct and inconsistent results. Finally, non‐invasive ventilation may make little or no difference to adverse events (complications), compared to medical care. The quality of results for studies reporting adverse events was low. Studies evaluating adverse events were poorly conducted and had inconsistent results.",CD005351
"Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Diagnosis and treatment may drastically affect quality of life, causing symptoms such as sleep disorders, depression and anxiety. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) is a programme that aims to reduce stress by developing mindfulness, meaning a non‐judgmental, accepting moment‐by‐moment awareness. MBSR seems to benefit patients with mood disorders and chronic pain, and it may also benefit women with breast cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Search methods In April 2018, we conducted a comprehensive electronic search for studies of MBSR in women with breast cancer, in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing MBSR versus no intervention in women with breast cancer. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Using a standardised data form, the review authors extracted data in duplicate on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest (quality of life, fatigue, depression, anxiety, quality of sleep, overall survival and adverse events). For outcomes assessed with the same instrument, we used the mean difference (MD) as a summary statistic for meta‐analysis; for those assessed with different instruments, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD). The effect of MBSR was assessed in the short term (end of intervention), medium term (up to 6 months after intervention) and long term (up to 24 months after intervention). Main results Fourteen RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, with most studies reporting that they included women with early breast cancer. Ten RCTs involving 1571 participants were eligible for meta‐analysis, while four studies involving 185 participants did not report usable results. Queries to the authors of these four studies were unsuccessful. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias since participants could not be blinded, and only 3 of 14 studies were at low risk of selection bias. Eight of 10 studies included in the meta‐analysis recruited participants with early breast cancer (the remaining 2 trials did not restrict inclusion to a certain cancer type). Most trials considered only women who had completed cancer treatment. MBSR may improve quality of life slightly at the end of the intervention (based on low‐certainty evidence from three studies with a total of 339 participants) but may result in little to no difference up to 6 months (based on low‐certainty evidence from three studies involving 428 participants). Long‐term data on quality of life (up to two years after completing MBSR) were available for one study in 97 participants (MD 0.00 on questionnaire FACT‐B, 95% CI −5.82 to 5.82; low‐certainty evidence). In the short term, MBSR probably reduces fatigue (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 5 studies; 693 participants). It also probably slightly reduces anxiety (SMD −0.29, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.08; moderate‐certainty evidence; 6 studies; 749 participants), and it reduces depression (SMD −0.54, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.22; high‐certainty evidence; 6 studies; 745 participants). It probably slightly improves quality of sleep (SMD −0.38, 95% CI −0.79 to 0.04; moderate‐certainty evidence; 4 studies; 475 participants). However, these confidence intervals (except for short‐term depression) are compatible with both an improvement and little to no difference. In the medium term, MBSR probably results in little to no difference in medium‐term fatigue (SMD −0.31, 95% CI −0.84 to 0.23; moderate‐certainty evidence; 4 studies; 607 participants). The intervention probably slightly reduces anxiety (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.07; moderate‐certainty evidence; 7 studies; 1094 participants), depression (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.58 to −0.06; moderate‐certainty evidence; 7 studies; 1097 participants) and slightly improves quality of sleep (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.63 to 0.08; moderate‐certainty evidence; 4 studies; 654 participants). However, these confidence intervals are compatible with both an improvement and little to no difference. In the long term, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that MBSR probably results in little to no difference in anxiety (SMD −0.09, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.16; 2 studies; 360 participants) or depression (SMD −0.17, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.05; 2 studies; 352 participants). No long‐term data were available for fatigue or quality of sleep. No study reported data on survival or adverse events. Authors' conclusions MBSR may improve quality of life slightly at the end of the intervention but may result in little to no difference later on. MBSR probably slightly reduces anxiety, depression and slightly improves quality of sleep at both the end of the intervention and up to six months later. A beneficial effect on fatigue was apparent at the end of the intervention but not up to six months later. Up to two years after the intervention, MBSR probably results in little to no difference in anxiety and depression; there were no data available for fatigue or quality of sleep.","Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for women with breast cancer What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) benefits women with breast cancer. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 14 studies, most of which included women with early breast cancer. Key messages The women's health was monitored at different time points: straight after completing MBSR, up to six months after completing MBSR and up to two years after MBSR. MBSR may slightly improve quality of life at the end of the intervention but result in little to no difference in women's overall well‐being (quality of life) later on. MBSR probably reduces anxiety and depression, and probably improves quality of sleep at both the end of MBSR and up to six months later. Women reported being less tired just after completing MBSR but not up to 6 months later. There was no information available on survival or adverse events. What was studied in the review? Women with breast cancer mostly experience diagnosis and treatment as a severe and life‐threatening situation that may drastically affect their quality of life, causing symptoms such as sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Previous research shows that MBSR seems to benefit patients with lung cancer, mood disorders or chronic pain, so it may also benefit women with breast cancer. MBSR is an eight‐week programme that aims to reduce stress by developing mindfulness, meaning that one practises moment‐by‐moment awareness in a non‐judgmental and accepting way. We wanted to study whether MBSR benefits women with breast cancer with regard to quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue and quality of sleep. We also looked at its influence on survival and adverse events related to cancer therapy. We searched for studies that compared MBSR versus no treatment, and we studied the results at the end of the intervention, up to six months after the intervention and up to 2 years after the intervention. What are the main results of this review? The review authors found 14 relevant studies including mostly women with early breast cancer. Most studies considered women who had completed cancer treatment. We could analyse only the results of 10 studies including 1571 participants; the other four studies did not report (usable) results; queries to the authors were unsuccessful. Of the 10 studies analysed, 6 were from the USA, 3 from Europe, and 1 from China. The review shows MBSR may improve quality of life slightly at the end of the intervention but may result in little to no difference up to six months or up to two years after completing MBSR. At the end of the intervention, MBSR reduces depression, probably slightly reduces fatigue and anxiety, and probably improves quality of sleep. Up to six months later, MBSR probably slightly reduces anxiety and slightly improves quality of sleep, and it slightly reduces depression. There was a benefit on fatigue at the end of the intervention but not up to six months later. However, for all beneficial effects except for short‐term depression, the results we found could be due to chance. Up to two years after the intervention, MBSR probably results in little to no difference in anxiety, depression and quality of life. No long‐term data were available for fatigue or quality of sleep. No study reported data on survival or adverse events. How up‐to‐date is this review? The authors searched for studies published up to April 2018.",CD011518
"Background A possible strategy for increasing smoking cessation rates could be to provide smokers with feedback on the current or potential future biomedical effects of smoking using, for example, measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO), lung function, or genetic susceptibility to lung cancer or other diseases. Objectives The main objective was to determine the efficacy of providing smokers with feedback on their exhaled CO measurement, spirometry results, atherosclerotic plaque imaging, and genetic susceptibility to smoking‐related diseases in helping them to quit smoking. Search methods For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register in March 2018 and ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP in September 2018 for studies added since the last update in 2012. Selection criteria Inclusion criteria for the review were: a randomised controlled trial design; participants being current smokers; interventions based on a biomedical test to increase smoking cessation rates; control groups receiving all other components of intervention; and an outcome of smoking cessation rate at least six months after the start of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We expressed results as a risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled studies using a Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects method. Main results We included 20 trials using a variety of biomedical tests interventions; one trial included two interventions, for a total of 21 interventions. We included a total of 9262 participants, all of whom were adult smokers. All studies included both men and women adult smokers at different stages of change and motivation for smoking cessation. We judged all but three studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. We pooled trials in three categories according to the type of biofeedback provided: feedback on risk exposure (five studies); feedback on smoking‐related disease risk (five studies); and feedback on smoking‐related harm (11 studies). There was no evidence of increased cessation rates from feedback on risk exposure, consisting mainly of feedback on CO measurement, in five pooled trials (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.21; I 2  = 0%; n = 2368). Feedback on smoking‐related disease risk, including four studies testing feedback on genetic markers for cancer risk and one study with feedback on genetic markers for risk of Crohn's disease, did not show a benefit in smoking cessation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I 2  = 0%; n = 2064). Feedback on smoking‐related harm, including nine studies testing spirometry with or without feedback on lung age and two studies on feedback on carotid ultrasound, also did not show a benefit (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; I 2  = 34%; n = 3314). Only one study directly compared multiple forms of measurement with a single form of measurement, and did not detect a significant difference in effect between measurement of CO plus genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and measurement of CO only (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.56; n = 189). Authors' conclusions There is little evidence about the effects of biomedical risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation. The most promising results relate to spirometry and carotid ultrasound, where moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, did not detect a statistically significant benefit, but confidence intervals very narrowly missed one, and the point estimate favoured the intervention. A sensitivity analysis removing those studies at high risk of bias did detect a benefit. Moderate‐certainty evidence limited by risk of bias did not detect an effect of feedback on smoking exposure by CO monitoring. Low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, did not detect a benefit from feedback on smoking‐related risk by genetic marker testing. There is insufficient evidence with which to evaluate the hypothesis that multiple types of assessment are more effective than single forms of assessment.","Does giving people feedback on the effects of smoking on their body help them quit smoking? Background Biomedical risk assessment is the process of giving people feedback on the effects of smoking on their body. The physical effects of smoking can be assessed using various measurements, and some people think this could be used as a tool to encourage people to quit smoking. We reviewed the evidence about whether giving adult smokers feedback on the effects of smoking on their body helps them quit smoking. Study characteristics This review includes 20 studies using a variety of measurements. One study included two measurements, for a total of 21 measurements assessed. The main feedback measurements we assessed were the level of carbon monoxide in people's breath (a sign of current smoking), measures of lung function (a sign of lung damage from smoking), genetic tests to provide individual risk of cancer, and ultrasound of major arteries in the neck to measure the amount of plaque (a risk factor for stroke). We grouped studies into three categories according to the type of feedback people were given: feedback on exposure to smoking (five studies); feedback on a person's risk for smoking‐related diseases (five studies); and feedback on the harms of smoking (11 studies). The studies included a total of 9262 people. All participants were adult smokers, and both men and women were included (although one study performed in a clinic for army veterans included only 4% women). Most studies were conducted in general practices or ambulatory clinics. All of the studies lasted at least six months. The reported evidence is current as of March 2018. Key results We did not find evidence that giving smokers feedback on their smoking exposure, their genetic risk of smoking‐related disease, or the effects of smoking on their body helps them quit smoking. The most promising results were for giving people feedback on the harm smoking does to their bodies. The studies did not report on harms or side effects of providing feedback. However, given the nature of the measurements (lung or blood tests), we would expect the risk of harms to be low. Certainty of evidence Because of problems with the way some of the studies were conducted, we think that further research is likely to change our conclusions.",CD004705
"Background Antidepressants may be useful in the treatment of abnormal crying associated with stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and last updated in 2010. Objectives To determine whether pharmaceutical treatment reduces the frequency of emotional displays in people with emotionalism after stroke. Search methods We searched the trial register of Cochrane Stroke (last searched May 2018). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to May 2018), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2018), Embase (1980 to 14 May 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 14 May 2018), PsycINFO (1967 to 14 May 2018), BIOSIS Previews (2002 to 14 May 2018), Web of Science (2002 to 14 May 2018), WHO ICTRP (to 14 May 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 14 May 2018), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 14 May 2018). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing psychotropic medication to placebo in people with stroke and emotionalism (also known as emotional lability, pathological crying or laughing, emotional incontinence, involuntary emotional expression disorder, and pseudobulbar affect). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data from all included studies, and used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. The primary emotionalism measures were the proportion of participants achieving at least a 50% reduction in abnormal emotional behaviour at the end of treatment, improved score on Center for Neurologic Study ‐ Lability Scale (CNS‐LS), Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC) or diminished tearfulness. Main results We included seven trials with a total of 239 participants. Two trials were of cross‐over design, and outcome data were not available from the first phase (precross‐over) in an appropriate format for inclusion as a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT). Thus, the results of the review are based on five trials with 213 participants. Treatment effects were observed on the following primary endpoints of emotionalism: There is very low quality of evidence from one small RCT that antidepressants increased the number of people who had 50% reduction in emotionalism (RR 16.50, 95% CI 1.07 to 253.40; 19 participants) and low quality evidence from one RCT of improved scores on Center for Neurologic Study ‐ Lability Scale (CNS‐LS) and Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC) with antidepressants (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.19; 28 participants). There was moderate quality evidence from three RCTS that they increased the number of people who had a reduction in tearfulness (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.71; 164 participants); and low quality evidence from one RCT of improved scores on the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale (PLCS) (MD 8.40, 95% CI 11.56 to 5.24; 28 participants). Six trials reported adverse events (death) and found no difference between the groups in death (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.50; 6 RCTs, 172 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Antidepressants may reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes based on very low quality evidence. Our conclusions must be qualified by several methodological deficiencies in the studies and interpreted with caution despite the effect being very large. The effect does not seem specific to one drug or class of drugs. More reliable data are required before appropriate conclusions can be made about the treatment of post‐stroke emotionalism. Future trialists investigating the effect of antidepressants in people with emotionalism after stroke should consider developing and using a standardised method to diagnose emotionalism, determine severity and assess change over time; provide treatment for a sufficient duration and follow‐up to better assess rates of relapse or maintenance and include careful assessment and complete reporting of adverse events.","Pharmaceutical interventions for emotionalism after stroke Review question Does pharmaceutical treatment reduce the frequency of unwanted emotional displays in people with emotionalism after stroke compared to placebo? Background Emotionalism often occurs after stroke. Emotionalism means that the person has difficulty controlling their emotional behaviour. People after stroke may suddenly start crying or, less commonly, laughing for no apparent reason. This is distressing for that particular person and their carers. Antidepressants, known to be helpful in people with depression, may be an effective treatment for emotionalism after stroke, but there have been very few randomised controlled trials in this area. Search date We identified studies by searches conducted on 14 May 2018. Study characteristics We included seven randomised controlled trials involving 239 participants in the review, which reported on the use of antidepressants for treating emotionalism. Trials ranged from small (10 participants) to large (92 participants). Mean/median age of participants ranged from 57.8 years to 73 years. Studies were from Europe (UK: 1, Denmark: 1, Scotland: 1, and Sweden: 1); Asia (South Korea: 1; and Japan: 1); and the USA: 1. Key results We included seven trials involving 239 participants (we identified no new trials since the previous version of the review). Two trials were of cross‐over design, and outcome data were not available from the first phase (precross‐over) in an appropriate format for inclusion as a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT). Data were only available for five trials with 213 participants. We observed treatment effects on the following: 50% reduction in emotionalism, improvements (reduction) in lability, Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC), diminished tearfulness and scores on the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale (PLCS). However, confidence intervals were wide indicating that treatment may have had only a small positive effect, or even a small negative effect (in one trial). Six trials reported death as an adverse event and found no differences between groups. Quality of the evidence We rated the evidence from very low to moderate quality due to these being small trials with some degree of bias. Conclusion Antidepressant drugs appear to reduce outbursts of crying or laughing. More trials with systematic assessment and reporting of adverse events are needed to ensure that these benefits outweigh the risks.",CD003690
"Background People with febrile neutropaenia are usually treated in a hospital setting. Recently, treatment with oral antibiotics has been proven to be as effective as intravenous therapy. However, the efficacy and safety of outpatient treatment have not been fully evaluated. Objectives To compare the efficacy (treatment failure and mortality) and safety (adverse events of antimicrobials) of outpatient treatment compared with inpatient treatment in people with cancer who have low‐risk febrile neutropaenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid (from 1948 to November week 4, 2018), Embase via Ovid (from 1980 to 2018, week 48) and trial registries (National Cancer Institute, MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, Medical Research Council Clinical Trial Directory). We handsearched all references of included studies and major reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outpatient with inpatient treatment for people with cancer who develop febrile neutropaenia. The outpatient group included those who started treatment as an inpatient and completed the antibiotic course at home (sequential) as well as those who started treatment at home. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. Primary outcome measures were: treatment failure and mortality; secondary outcome measures considered were: duration of fever, adverse drug reactions to antimicrobial treatment, duration of neutropaenia, duration of hospitalisation, duration of antimicrobial treatment, and quality of life (QoL). We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data; we calculated weighted mean differences for continuous data. Random‐effects meta‐analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Main results We included ten RCTs, six in adults (628 participants) and four in children (366 participants). We found no clear evidence of a difference in treatment failure between the outpatient and inpatient groups, either in adults (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.85, I 2  0%; six studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or children (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.99, I 2  0%; four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). For mortality, we also found no clear evidence of a difference either in studies in adults (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.71; six studies; 628 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) or in children (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.70; three studies; 329 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). According to the type of intervention (early discharge or exclusively outpatient), meta‐analysis of treatment failure in four RCTs in adults with early discharge (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.95; P = 0.26, I 2  0%; 364 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) was similar to the results of the exclusively outpatient meta‐analysis (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.13; P = 0.65, I 2  19%; two studies; 264 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Regarding the secondary outcome measures, we found no clear evidence of a difference between outpatient and inpatient groups in duration of fever (adults: mean difference (MD) 0.2, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.76, 1 study, 169 participants; low‐certainty evidence) (children: MD ‐0.6, 95% CI ‐0.84 to 0.71, 3 studies, 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and in duration of neutropaenia (adults: MD 0.1, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.79, 1 study, 169 participants; low‐certainty evidence) (children: MD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.86 to 0.55, 2 studies, 268 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). With regard to adverse drug reactions, although there was greater frequency in the outpatient group, we found no clear evidence of a difference when compared to the inpatient group, either in adult participants (RR 8.39, 95% CI 0.38 to 187.15; three studies; 375 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or children (RR 1.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.98; two studies; 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies compared the hospitalisation time and found that the mean number of days of hospital stay was lower in the outpatient treated group by 1.64 days in adults (MD ‐1.64, 95% CI ‐2.22 to ‐1.06; 3 studies, 251 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and by 3.9 days in children (MD ‐3.90, 95% CI ‐5.37 to ‐2.43; 1 study, 119 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In the 3 RCTs of children in which days of antimicrobial treatment were analysed, we found no difference between outpatient and inpatient groups (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐1.26 to 1.12; 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We identified two studies that measured QoL: one in adults and one in children. QoL was slightly better in the outpatient group than in the inpatient group in both studies, but there was no consistency in the domains included. Authors' conclusions Outpatient treatment for low‐risk febrile neutropaenia in people with cancer probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure and mortality compared with the standard hospital (inpatient) treatment and may reduce time that patients need to be treated in hospital.","Outpatient treatment for cancer patient with low‐risk febrile neutropaenic event is effective. Review question   Is outpatient treatment with antibiotics safe and effective for people with cancer who have low neutrophil levels (type of white blood cell) and develop a fever (called febrile neutropaenia), usually as a result of chemotherapy? Background   Neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) are key to fighting bacterial infections. People treated for cancer often have low neutrophil levels, which is called neutropaenia, most commonly because of chemotherapy treatment. This leaves them susceptible to infection, which can become serious and potentially life‐threatening very quickly. This is called neutropaenic sepsis. For many years, people with cancer who develop a fever whilst they are neutropaenic (called neutropaenic fever) have been given antibiotics to prevent them from developing overwhelming neutropaenic sepsis. Depending of the duration of neutropaenia, as well as type of cancer, age and other symptoms, patients can fall in to two risk groups: high‐ or low risk of developing a serious infection. Recently, treatment with oral antibiotics (medicine given as liquid or tablets by mouth) has been proven to be as effective as intravenous (medicine injected into a vein) treatments. However, it is unclear whether providing treatment in an outpatient setting is as safe as therapy administered in a hospital setting. Study characteristics   Ten studies (994 participants) provided information for the review. These ten studies compared outpatient antibiotic therapy (491 participants) versus inpatient therapy (503 participants) in people with cancer who developed febrile neutropaenia. Six studies were conducted in adults (628 participants) and four studies were in children (366 participants). These ten trials compared effectiveness in terms of the disappearance of signs of infection (mainly fever) and nine studies assessed the effect on mortality (death). Eight studies recorded the number of treatment days for the fever to resolve. Five studies compared the duration of neutropaenia between out‐ and inpatients. Five studies analysed duration of antibiotics usage and six looked at the duration of hospitalisation.Two studies assessed quality of life for patients. In eight of the 10 studies, outpatient antibiotic therapy was part of an early discharge programme, i.e. antibiotics were given for a few days in the hospital and then the participants was discharged home. In the other two studies, the antibiotics were started at home. Key results   Outpatient antibiotic therapy is probably as effective as inpatient therapy in people (both in adults and children) with cancer who develop febrile neutropaenia for improving the signs of infection, including reducing fever. There was probably little or no difference in mortality between the outpatient therapy and inpatient therapy, as well as in the duration of treatment with antibiotics, or frequency of adverse events related to the use of antibiotics. Treatment as an outpatient may reduce the number of days patients need to be treated in hospital. Certainty of the evidence   In general, the studies were of moderate certainty.",CD009031
"Background Psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with chronic illness aim to improve parenting behavior and mental health, child functioning (behavior/disability, mental health, and medical symptoms), and family functioning. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review (2012) which was first updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and trials registries for studies published up to July 2018. Selection criteria Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. In this update we included studies with more than 20 participants per arm. In this update, we included interventions that combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. We included comparison groups that received either non‐psychological treatment (e.g. psychoeducation), treatment as usual (e.g. standard medical care without added psychological therapy), or wait‐list. Data collection and analysis We extracted study characteristics and outcomes post‐treatment and at first available follow‐up. Primary outcomes were parenting behavior and parent mental health. Secondary outcomes were child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, and family functioning. We pooled data using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and a random‐effects model, and evaluated outcomes by medical condition and by therapy type. We assessed risk of bias per Cochrane guidance and quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results We added 21 new studies. We removed 23 studies from the previous update that no longer met our inclusion criteria. There are now 44 RCTs, including 4697 participants post‐treatment. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (13), diabetes (15), inflammatory bowel disease (2), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3). Therapy types included cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT; 21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and problem‐solving therapy (PST; 12). We rated risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, except selective reporting bias, which we rated high for 19 studies due to incomplete outcome reporting. Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. We downgraded evidence due to high heterogeneity, imprecision, and publication bias. Evaluation of parent outcomes by medical condition Psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior (e.g. maladaptive or solicitous behaviors; lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.43 to −0.13; participants = 664; studies = 3; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.05; participants = 625; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%, respectively, low‐quality evidence), chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.29, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.10; participants = 755; studies = 6; SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.20; participants = 678; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence), diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −1.39, 95% CI −2.41 to −0.38; participants = 338; studies = 5, very low‐quality evidence), and traumatic brain injury post‐treatment (SMD −0.74, 95% CI −1.25 to −0.22; participants = 254; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment. Psychological therapies may improve parent mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.08; participants = 836, studies = 6, high‐quality evidence; SMD −0.23, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.08; participants = 667; studies = 4, moderate‐quality evidence, respectively), and chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.06; participants = 490; studies = 3; SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.02; participants = 482; studies = 3, respectively, low‐quality evidence). Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.90 to 0.42; participants = 211; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent mental health. Evaluation of parent outcomes by psychological therapy type CBT may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment (SMD −0.45, 95% CI −0.68 to −0.21; participants = 1040; studies = 9, low‐quality evidence), and follow‐up (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.11; participants = 743; studies = 6, moderate‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence for a beneficial effect for CBT on parent mental health at post‐treatment or follow‐up (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.03; participants = 811; studies = 8; SMD −0.07, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.20; participants = 592; studies = 5; respectively, very low‐quality evidence). PST may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.39, 95% CI −0.64 to −0.13; participants = 947; studies = 7, low‐quality evidence; SMD −0.54, 95% CI −0.94 to −0.14; participants = 852; studies = 6, very low‐quality evidence, respectively), and parent mental health post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.15; participants = 891; studies = 6; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.07; participants = 800; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent outcomes. Adverse events We could not evaluate treatment safety because most studies (32) did not report on whether adverse events occurred during the study period. In six studies, the authors reported that no adverse events occurred. The remaining six studies reported adverse events and none were attributed to psychological therapy. We rated the quality of evidence for adverse events as moderate. Authors' conclusions Psychological therapy may improve parenting behavior among parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury. We also found beneficial effects of psychological therapy may also improve parent mental health among parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. CBT and PST may improve parenting behavior. PST may also improve parent mental health. However, the quality of evidence is generally low and there are insufficient data to evaluate most outcomes. Our findings could change as new studies are conducted.","Psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness Bottom line We found that psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior for parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes or traumatic brain injury, and may improve mental health of parents of children with cancer or chronic pain. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) and problem‐solving therapy (PST) are promising types of therapy. We were not able to answer questions about whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children with other medical conditions, or whether other types of therapy are helpful, because there were not enough data. Our findings may have been impacted by differences in measures used across studies. New studies may change the results of this review, and so our findings should be interpreted cautiously. Background We have updated our previously published review of psychological therapies for parents of children with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness to include studies published through July 2018. Parenting a child with a longstanding illness is challenging. Parents may have difficulty balancing caring for their child with other demands and can experience increased stress, sadness, or family conflict. Their children may have emotional or behavioral concerns. Parents can influence their child's adaptation to living with their medical condition. Psychological therapies for parents provide training in skills to modify emotions or behaviors that aim to improve parent, child, and family well‐being. We wanted to understand whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children and adolescents (up to age 19) with longstanding illness. We included studies of interventions that were predominantly psychological and delivered to parents compared with non‐psychological treatment, treatment as usual, or wait‐list. Outcomes were parenting behavior (e.g. protective behaviors), parent mental health, child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, family functioning, and side effects. Key results We added 21 new studies in this update and we removed 23 studies that no longer met our inclusion criteria, resulting in 44 randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials, where participants are assigned randomly to either one treatment or a different treatment or no treatment, provide the most reliable evidence) with a total of 4697 participants (average child age = 11 years). The length of the studies ranged from one day to 24 months. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (recurrent or persistent pain for more than three months, including two studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease (15)), diabetes (15), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3); one study included children with eczema and children with asthma. Therapy types included CBT (21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and PST (12). Funding sources included federal and local governments, hospitals, universities, and foundations. We found that parenting behavior improved in studies of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term for parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. Parent mental health improved in studies of children with cancer and chronic pain immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes. We found that CBT and PST improved parenting behavior immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. PST also improved parent mental health immediately after treatment and long‐term, but CBT did not. We could not evaluate whether the other types of psychological therapy were beneficial for parents due to insufficient data. We found that these treatment effects were generally small. We found that most studies (32 studies) did not report on whether side effects occurred. In the few studies that did, none of the participants experienced side effects from psychological therapy. Quality of evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. There were not enough data to answer some parts of our review questions. There was sufficient evidence (low to moderate quality) to reach some conclusions about the effects of psychological therapy for parents of children with cancer and chronic pain and the effects of CBT and PST.",CD009660
"Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review ‐ one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD ‐ focuses on second‐generation antidepressants (SGAs). Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non‐randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random‐effects (Mantel‐Haenszel) meta‐analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi 2  statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I 2  statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots.We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. Main results We identified 3745 citations after de‐duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate‐quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low‐quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high‐risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions.","Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? • Anyone who has experienced winter depression. • Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. • General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists. • Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended‐release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.",CD011268
"Background Infantile colic is typically defined as full‐force crying for at least three hours per day, on at least three days per week, for at least three weeks. Infantile colic affects a large number of infants and their families worldwide. Its symptoms are broad and general, and while not indicative of disease, may represent a serious underlying condition in a small percentage of infants who may need a medical assessment. Probiotics are live microorganisms that alter the microflora of the host and provide beneficial health effects. The most common probiotics used are of  Lactobacillus ,  Bifidobacterium  and  Streptococcus . There is growing evidence to suggest that intestinal flora in colicky infants differ from those in healthy infants, and it is suggested that probiotics can redress this balance and provide a healthier intestinal microbiota landscape. The low cost and easy availability of probiotics makes them a potential prophylactic solution to reduce the incidence and prevalence of infantile colic. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics in preventing or reducing severity of infantile colic. Search methods In January 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 10 other databases and two trials registers. In addition, we handsearched the abstracts of relevant meetings, searched reference lists, ran citation searches of included studies, and contacted authors and experts in the field, including the manufacturers of probiotics, to identify unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised control trials (RCTs) of newborn infants less than one month of age without the diagnosis of infantile colic at recruitment. We included any probiotic, alone or in combination with a prebiotic (also known as synbiotics), versus no intervention, another intervention(s) or placebo, where the focus of the study was the effect of the intervention on infantile colic. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures of Cochrane. Main results Our search yielded 3284 records, and of these, we selected 21 reports for full‐text review. Six studies with 1886 participants met our inclusion criteria, comparing probiotics with placebo. Two studies examined  Lactobacillus reuteri DSM , two examined multi‐strain probiotics, one examined  Lactobacillus rhamnosus , and one examined  Lactobacillus paracasei  and  Bifidobacterium animalis . Two studies began probiotics during pregnancy and continued administering them to the baby after birth. We considered the risk of bias for randomisation as low for all six trials; for allocation concealment as low in two studies and unclear in four others. All studies were blinded, and at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. A random‐effects meta‐analysis of three studies (1148 participants) found no difference between the groups in relation to occurrence of new cases of colic: risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.19; low‐certainty evidence; I 2  = 72%. A random‐effects meta‐analysis of all six studies (1851 participants) found no difference between the groups in relation to serious adverse effects (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.21; low‐certainty evidence; I 2  not calculable (only four serious events for one comparison, two in each group: meconium plug obstruction, patent ductus arteriosus and neonatal hepatitis). A random‐effects meta‐analysis of three studies (707 participants) found a mean difference (MD) of –32.57 minutes per day (95% CI –55.60 to –9.54; low‐certainty evidence; I 2  = 93%) in crying time at study end in favour of probiotics. A subgroup analysis of the most studied agent,  Lactobacillus reuteri , showed a reduction of 44.26 minutes in daily crying with a random‐effects model (95% CI –66.6 to –21.9; I 2  = 92%), in favour of probiotics. Authors' conclusions There is no clear evidence that probiotics are more effective than placebo at preventing infantile colic; however, daily crying time appeared to reduce with probiotic use compared to placebo. There were no clear differences in adverse effects. We are limited in our ability to draw conclusions by the certainty of the evidence, which we assessed as being low across all three outcomes, meaning that we are not confident that these results would not change with the addition of further research.","Probiotics to prevent infantile colic What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to investigate if probiotics given to healthy babies prevent infantile colic, and if they are safe. Key messages Although probiotics make little or no difference to the occurrence of infantile colic, they may reduce crying time and there were no safety concerns. We still require more research to work out if the onset of colic can be reduced. What did the review study? Infantile colic affects a large number of infants and their families worldwide. Infantile colic is a problem characterised by episodes of inconsolable crying lasting for longer than three hours per day, for more than three days a week, for at least three weeks. Probiotics are live bacteria that, when ingested, can be beneficial for patients. Probiotics are cheap and readily available, and there is recent research investigating their use for this problem. What were the main results of the review? This review included six studies. The infants in the probiotics group were given different types of probiotics, and in different doses, and compared to infants who were given a placebo (dummy medicine). The review found that, compared to placebo, probiotics made little or no difference to the occurrence of infantile colic, but appeared to reduce crying time. There was no difference in the reporting of side effects, with only four serious events reported in one large study, and these were clinically unlikely to be linked to the taking of either of the study products. How up‐to‐date was this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to January 2018.",CD012473
"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition causing accumulation of mucus in the airways, cough, and breathlessness; the disease is progressive and is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide. Current treatment strategies for COPD are multi‐modal and aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase patients' quality of life by slowing disease progression and preventing exacerbations. Fixed‐dose combinations (FDCs) of a long‐acting beta 2 ‐agonist (LABA) plus a long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler are approved by regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and Japan for the treatment of COPD. Several LABA/LAMA FDCs are available and recent meta‐analyses have clarified their utility versus their mono‐components in COPD. Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of once‐daily LABA/LAMA FDCs versus placebo will facilitate the comparison of different FDCs in future network meta‐analyses. Objectives We assessed the evidence for once‐daily LABA/LAMA combinations (delivered in a single inhaler) versus placebo on clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with stable COPD. Search methods We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( apps.who.int/trialsearch ). We searched CASR and trial registries from their inception to 3 December 2018; we imposed no restriction on language of publication. Selection criteria We included parallel‐group and cross‐over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once‐daily LABA/LAMA FDC versus placebo. We included studies reported as full‐text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded very short‐term trials with a duration of less than 3 weeks. We included adults (≥ 40 years old) with a diagnosis of stable COPD. We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Where possible, we used a random‐effects model to meta‐analyse extracted data. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings’ tables. Main results We identified and included 22 RCTs randomly assigning 8641 people with COPD to either once‐daily LABA/LAMA FDC (6252 participants) or placebo (3819 participants); nine studies had a cross‐over design. Studies had a duration of between three and 52 weeks (median 12 weeks). The mean age of participants across the included studies ranged from 59 to 65 years and in 21 of 22 studies, participants had GOLD stage II or III COPD. Concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use was permitted in all of the included studies (where stated); across the included studies, between 28% to 58% of participants were using ICS at baseline. Six studies evaluated the once‐daily combination of IND/GLY (110/50 μg), seven studies evaluated TIO/OLO (2.5/5 or 5/5 μg), eight studies evaluated UMEC/VI (62.5/5, 125/25 or 500/25 μg) and one study evaluated ACD/FOR (200/6, 200/12 or 200/18 μg); all LABA/LAMA combinations were compared with placebo. The risk of bias was generally considered to be low or unknown (insufficient detail provided), with only one study per domain considered to have a high risk of bias except for the domain 'other bias' which was determined to be at high risk of bias in four studies (in three studies, disease severity was greater at baseline in participants receiving LABA/LAMA compared with participants receiving placebo, which would be expected to shift the treatment effect in favour of placebo). Compared to the placebo, the pooled results for the primary outcomes for the once‐daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: all‐cause mortality, OR 1.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 4.36, low‐certainty evidence); all‐cause serious adverse events (SAEs), OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.28, high‐certainty evidence); acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, moderate‐certainty evidence); adjusted St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, MD ‐4.08 (95% CI ‐4.80 to ‐3.36, high‐certainty evidence); proportion of SGRQ responders, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.99). Compared with placebo, the pooled results for the secondary outcomes for the once‐daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), MD 0.20 L (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21, moderate‐certainty evidence); adjusted peak FEV1, MD 0.31 L (95% CI 0.29 to 0.32, moderate‐certainty evidence); and all‐cause AEs, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; high‐certainty evidence). No studies reported data for the 6‐minute walk test. The results were generally consistent across subgroups for different LABA/LAMA combinations and doses. Authors' conclusions Compared with placebo, once‐daily LABA/LAMA (either IND/GLY, UMEC/VI or TIO/OLO) via a combination inhaler is associated with a clinically significant improvement in lung function and health‐related quality of life in patients with mild‐to‐moderate COPD; UMEC/VI appears to reduce the rate of exacerbations in this population. These conclusions are supported by moderate or high certainty evidence based on studies with an observation period of up to one year.","Once daily long‐acting beta2‐agonists and long‐acting muscarinic antagonists in a combined inhaler versus placebo for COPD We wanted to know whether once‐daily treatment with a fixed‐dose combination of a long‐acting beta2 agonist (LABA) plus a long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler is better than treatment with a dummy inhaler (placebo) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Background to the review COPD is a disease of the lungs and is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide. People with COPD experience symptoms of cough, breathlessness and a build up of mucus, which become worse over time. Current treatments for COPD aim to manage these symptoms and improve the quality of life of people with the disease. A combination of a LABA plus a LAMA taken once‐daily in a single inhaler (LABA/LAMA) has been shown to be more effective than taking each separately in individual inhalers. Several different combinations of inhaled LABA and LAMA are available (e.g. indacaterol/glycopyrronium, olodaterol/tiotropium, formoterol/aclidinium, and vilanterol/umeclidinium) and are used for the treatment of COPD. By gathering information from clinical trials that compare once‐daily LABA/LAMA with placebo in a dummy inhaler we will provide information to help future research decide which combination is best for treating people with COPD. What did we find? Twenty‐two studies (including 8641 people with COPD) compared once‐daily LABA/LAMA in a single inhaler with a dummy inhaler. People were allowed to continue to use their inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) during the studies; approximately a third to a half of people were using their ICS at the beginning of each study. The evidence presented in this review is current up to December 2018. The majority of people who took part in the studies had mild‐to‐moderate COPD and the average age of people in each study ranged from 59 to 65 years. Six studies evaluated the once‐daily combination of indacaterol/glycopyrronium, seven studies evaluated tiotropium/olodaterol, eight studies evaluated umeclidinium/vilanterol and one study evaluated aclidinium/formoterol. People who took once‐daily LABA/LAMA using a single inhaler showed a greater improvement in quality of life than those taking placebo in a dummy inhaler; lung function was also improved in people taking once‐daily LABA/LAMA. People taking umeclidinium/vilanterol had fewer flare‐ups (exacerbations). There was no significant difference between groups (LABA/LAMA versus placebo) in the number of people who died, or in the number of people who experienced serious adverse events or any adverse event. The results were similar for the different LABA/LAMA combinations and doses that we evaluated. The included studies were generally well designed and well reported. People in the studies and those performing the research did not know which treatment people were receiving, which ensures a fair evaluation of the treatments. In three of the studies, people who were taking once‐daily LABA/LAMA had more severe COPD at the start of the study than people taking dummy inhalers; this could have reduced the treatment effect seen with LABA/LAMA in these studies so we can be confident that our findings do not overestimate the effect seen with once‐daily LABA/LAMA. One of the outcomes of interest (how far a person is able to walk in six minutes) was not reported by any of the included studies. Overall, we can be confident in the conclusions of this review.",CD012930
"Background Physical exercise training might improve muscle and cardiorespiratory function in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Optimization of aerobic capacity or other resources in residual muscle tissue through exercise may counteract the muscle deterioration that occurs secondary to motor neuron loss and inactivity in SMA. There is currently no evidence synthesis available on physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3. Objectives To assess the effects of physical exercise training on functional performance in people with SMA type 3, and to identify any adverse effects. Search methods On 8 May 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and LILACS. On 25 April 2018 we searched NHSEED, DARE, and ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs lasting at least 12 weeks that compared physical exercise training (strength training, aerobic exercise training, or both) to placebo, standard or usual care, or another type of non‐physical intervention for SMA type 3. Participants were adults and children from the age of five years with a diagnosis of SMA type 3 (Kugelberg‐Welander syndrome), confirmed by genetic analysis. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results We included one RCT that studied the effects of a six‐month, home‐based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA. The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. The study was evaluator‐blinded, but personnel and participants could not be blinded to the intervention, which placed the results at a high risk of bias. Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but 50% of the participants did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. The trial used change in walking distance on the six‐minute walk test as a measure of function; a minimal detectable change is 24.0 m. The change from baseline to six months' follow‐up in the training group (9.4 m) was not detectably different from the change in the usual care group (‐0.14 m) (mean difference (MD) 9.54 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐83.04 to 102.12; N = 12). Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, assessed by the change from baseline to six months' follow‐up in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) was similar in the training group (‐0.12 mL/kg/min) and the usual care group (‐1.34 mL/kg/min) (MD 1.22 mL/kg/min, 95% CI ‐2.16 to 4.6; N = 12). A clinically meaningful increase in VO 2max  is 3.5 mL/kg/min. The trial assessed function on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale ‐ Expanded (HFMSE), which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 66, with an increase of 3 or more points indicating clinically meaningful improvement. The HFMSE score in the training group increased by 2 points from baseline to six months' follow‐up, with no change in the usual care group (MD 2.00, 95% CI ‐2.06 to 6.06; N = 12). The training group showed a slight improvement in muscle strength, expressed as the manual muscle testing (MMT) total score, which ranges from 28 (weakest) to 280 (strongest). The change from baseline in MMT total score was 6.8 in the training group compared to ‐5.14 in the usual care group (MD 11.94, 95% CI ‐3.44 to 27.32; N = 12). The trial stated that training had no statistically significant effects on fatigue and quality of life. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low because of study limitations and imprecision. The study did not assess the effects of physical exercise training on physical activity levels. No study‐related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred, but we cannot draw wider conclusions from this very low‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions It is uncertain whether combined strength and aerobic exercise training is beneficial or harmful in people with SMA type 3, as the quality of evidence is very low. We need well‐designed and adequately powered studies using protocols that meet international standards for the development of training interventions, in order to improve our understanding of the exercise response in people with SMA type 3 and eventually develop exercise guidelines for this condition.","Physical exercise training for people with spinal muscular atrophy type 3 Review question In people with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3, does physical exercise training improve motor function, cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, fatigue, physical activity levels, or quality of life, and does it have unwanted effects? Background Physical exercise training could improve the physical fitness of people with SMA type 3 and protect them from muscle wasting due to inactivity and disease progression. However, we do not know whether physical exercise training is safe or what specific parts of an exercise program might be helpful. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3. Search date The evidence is up to date to May 2018. Study characteristics We included one trial that studied the effects of a six‐month, home‐based training program that combined exercises to increase muscle strength with aerobic exercise training (exercise that increases breathing and heart rate). The aerobic exercise training used in the trial was recumbent cycling training (seated cycling, with back support). The study included 14 people with SMA type 3, all of whom were able to walk. The participants were between 10 years and 48 years old and had SMA type 3 of mild‐to‐moderate severity. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to hide the treatment group from participants or personnel, which is an important limitation when measurements rely on participant assessments or effort. Study funding sources The included study was supported by the United States Department of Defense and the SMA Foundation. Key results and certainty of the evidence Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but only half of them completed the full aerobic exercise program. The effects of physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3 remain unclear, as the evidence is very uncertain.",CD012120
"Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic mucosal inflammation, frequent hospitalizations, adverse health economics, and compromised quality of life. Diet has been hypothesised to influence IBD activity. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions on IBD outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP from inception to 31 January 2019. We also scanned reference lists of included studies, relevant reviews and guidelines. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of dietary manipulations to other diets in participants with IBD. Studies that exclusively focused on enteral nutrition, oral nutrient supplementation, medical foods, probiotics, and parenteral nutrition were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data and assessed bias using the risk of bias tool. We conducted meta‐analyses where possible using a random‐effects model and calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results The review included 18 RCTs with 1878 participants. The studies assessed different dietary interventions for active CD (six studies), inactive CD (seven studies), active UC (one study) and inactive UC (four studies). Dietary interventions involved either the consumption of low amounts or complete exclusion of one or more food groups known to trigger IBD symptoms. There was limited scope for data pooling as the interventions and control diets were diverse. The studies were mostly inadequately powered. Fourteen studies were rated as high risk of bias. The other studies were rated as unclear risk of bias. The effect of high fiber, low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle diet, low calcium diet, symptoms‐guided diet and highly restricted organic diet on clinical remission in active CD is uncertain. At 4 weeks, remission was induced in: 100% (4/4) of participants in the low refined carbohydrates diet group compared to 0% (0/3) of participants in the control group (RR 7.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 97.83; 7 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 44% (23/52) of participants in the low microparticle diet achieved clinical remission compared to 25% (13/51) of control‐group participants (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.22 to 43.84; 103 participants; 2 studies; I² = 73%; very low certainty evidence). Fifty per cent (16/32) of participants in the symptoms‐guided diet group achieved clinical remission compared to 0% (0/19) of control group participants (RR 20.00, 95% CI 1.27 to 315.40; 51 participants ; 1 study; very low certainty evidence) (follow‐up unclear). At 24 weeks, 50% (4/8) of participants in the highly restricted organic diet achieved clinical remission compared to 50% (5/10) of participants in the control group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.53; 18 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 37% (16/43) participants following a low calcium diet achieved clinical remission compared to 30% (12/40) in the control group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29; 83 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of low refined carbohydrate diets, symptoms‐guided diets and low red processed meat diets on relapse in inactive CD is uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 67% (176/264) of participants in low refined carbohydrate diet relapsed compared to 64% (193/303) in the control group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; 567 participants; 3 studies; I² = 35%; low certainty evidence). At 6 to 24 months, 48% (24/50) of participants in the symptoms‐guided diet group relapsed compared to 83% (40/48) participants in the control diet (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.01; 98 participants ; 2 studies; I² = 54%; low certainty evidence). At 48 weeks, 66% (63/96) of participants in the low red and processed meat diet group relapsed compared to 63% (75/118) of the control group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; 214 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 0% (0/16) of participants on an exclusion diet comprised of low disaccharides / grains / saturated fats / red and processed meat experienced clinical relapse compared to 26% (10/38) of participants on a control group (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.76; 54 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of a symptoms‐guided diet on clinical remission in active UC is uncertain. At six weeks, 36% (4/11) of symptoms‐guided diet participants achieved remission compared to 0% (0/10) of usual diet participants (RR 8.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 136.33; 21 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of the Alberta‐based anti‐inflammatory diet, the Carrageenan‐free diet or milk‐free diet on relapse rates in inactive UC is uncertain. At 6 months, 36% (5/14) of participants in the Alberta‐based anti‐inflammatory diet group relapsed compared to 29% (4/14) of participants in the control group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.70; 28 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). Thirty per cent (3/10) of participants following the carrageenan‐free diet for 12 months relapsed compared to 60% (3/5) of the participants in the control group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 15 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 59% (23/39) of milk free diet participants relapsed compared to 68% (26/38) of control diet participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.15; 77 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on diet‐related adverse events. Authors' conclusions The effects of dietary interventions on CD and UC are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of dietary interventions in CD and UC can be drawn. There is need for consensus on the composition of dietary interventions in IBD and more RCTs are required to evaluate these interventions. Currently, there are at least five ongoing studies (estimated enrollment of 498 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.","Diets for inducing and maintaining remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) What is the aim of the review? The aim was to find out what diets can be used to induce or maintain remission in people with IBD. What is IBD? IBD involves inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are the most common types of IBD. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and rectal bleeding. IBD is characterized by periods of relapse where people experience symptoms of active disease and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. While some foods may provoke IBD symptoms, little is known about whether diets help to induce or maintain remission in IBD. How up to date is the review? We searched for studies up to 31 January 2019. What are the main results of the review? We found 18 studies including 1878 participants. The diets studied included reduction or exclusion of foods believed to provoke IBD symptoms. These diets were compared with 'usual' diets. The studies assessed dietary interventions for active CD (six studies), inactive CD (seven studies), active UC (one study) and inactive UC (four studies). One study recruited children, while the rest included adults. The studies were poorly designed and had few participants. As a result the overall quality of the evidence was very low. The effect of high fiber, low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle, low calcium, symptoms‐guided diet and highly restricted organic diet on clinical remission in active CD is uncertain. In one study, remission was achieved at 4 weeks in 100% (4/4) of low refined carbohydrates participants compared to 0% (0/3) of usual diet participants. In a pooled analysis of two studies, 44% (23/52) of low microparticle participants achieved remission at 16 weeks compared to 25% (13/51) of usual diet participants. One study found that 50% (16/32) of symptoms‐guided participants achieved remission compared to 0% (0/19) of usual diet participants. One study found that 50% (4/8) of highly‐restricted organic diet participants achieved remission at 24 weeks compared to 50% (5/10) of usual diet participants. One study found that 37% (16/43) of low‐calcium participants achieved remission at 16 weeks compared to 30% (12/40) of usual diet participants. The effect of low refined carbohydrate, symptoms‐guided and low red processed meat diets on relapse in inactive CD is uncertain. In a pooled analysis of three studies, 67% (176/264) of low refined carbohydrate participants relapsed at 12 to 24 months compared to 64% (193/303) of usual diet participants. In a pooled analysis of two studies, 48% (24/50) of symptoms‐guided participants relapsed at 6 to 24 months compared to 83% (40/48) of usual diet participants. One study found that 66% (63/96) of low red and processed meat participants relapsed at 48 weeks compared to 63% (75/118) of usual diet participants. One study showed that 0% (0/16) of exclusion diet participants (i.e. low disaccharides, grains, saturated fats, red and processed meat) relapsed at 12 months compared to 26% (10/38) of usual diet participants. The effect of a symptoms‐guided diet on clinical remission in active UC is uncertain. In one study, 36% (4/11) of symptoms‐guided participants achieved remission at six weeks compared to 0% (0/10) in the usual diet group. The effect of the Alberta‐based anti‐inflammatory diet, the Carrageenan‐free diet and the milk‐free diet on relapse in inactive UC is uncertain. In one study, 36% (5/14) of Alberta‐based diet participants relapsed at 6 months compared to 29% (4/14) of usual diet participants. In one study, 30% (3/10) of carrageenan‐free participants relapsed at 12 months compared to 60% (3/5) of usual diet participants. At 12 months, 59% (23/39) of milk‐free diet participants relapsed compared to 68% (26/38) in the usual diet group. None of the included studies reported on diet‐related side effects. Conclusions The effects of dietary interventions on CD and UC are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of dietary interventions in CD and UC can be drawn. There is need for consensus on the composition of dietary interventions in IBD and more studies are required to evaluate these interventions. Currently, there are five ongoing studies (estimated enrollment of 498 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.",CD012839
"Background Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet physiologic needs; it is caused by many conditions, particularly iron deficiency. Traditionally, daily iron supplementation has been a standard practice for preventing and treating anaemia. However, its long‐term use has been limited, as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation, and teeth staining. Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for preventing and reducing anaemia at the population level, especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent. Objectives To assess the effects of intermittent oral iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on anaemia and its associated impairments among menstruating women, compared with no intervention, a placebo, or daily supplementation. Search methods In February 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and two trials registers. In March 2018, we also searched LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. In addition, we examined reference lists, and contacted authors and known experts to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were menstruating women; that is, women beyond menarche and prior to menopause who were not pregnant or lactating and did not have a known condition that impeded the presence of menstrual periods. The intervention was the use of iron supplements intermittently (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) compared with placebo, no intervention, or the same supplements provided on a daily basis. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies, checked data entry for accuracy, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 25 studies involving 10,996 women. Study methods were not well described in many of the included studies and thus assessing risk of bias was difficult. The main limitations of the studies were lack of blinding and high attrition. Studies were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one third of the included studies did not provide a funding source. Although quality across studies was variable, the results consistently showed that intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) compared with no intervention or a placebo, reduced the risk of having anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.87; 11 studies, 3135 participants; low‐quality evidence), and improved the concentration of haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.19 g/L, 95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 15 studies, 2886 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and ferritin (MD 7.46 μg/L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 7 studies, 1067 participants; low‐quality evidence). Intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 3 studies, 624 participants; low‐quality evidence), but evidence was inconclusive regarding iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 1 study, 97 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and all‐cause morbidity (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; 1 study, 119 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Women in the control group were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving intermittent iron supplements (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). In comparison with daily supplementation, results showed that intermittent supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) produced similar effects to daily supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) on anaemia (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; 8 studies, 1749 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Intermittent supplementation may produce similar haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.43 g/L, 95% CI −1.44 to 2.31; 10 studies, 2127 participants; low‐quality evidence) but lower ferritin concentrations on average (MD −6.07 μg/L, 95% CI −10.66 to −1.48; 4 studies, 988 participants; low‐quality evidence) compared to daily supplementation. Compared to daily regimens, intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 1 study, 198 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Women receiving iron supplements intermittently were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 6 studies, 1166 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). No studies reported on the effect of intermittent regimens versus daily regimens on iron deficiency anaemia and all‐cause morbidity. Information on disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance was scarce, and evidence about the effects of intermittent supplementation on these outcomes unclear. Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings. Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria was frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings. Authors' conclusions Intermittent iron supplementation may reduce anaemia and may improve iron stores among menstruating women in populations with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently is probably as effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression, and adherence to the intervention. The quality of this evidence base ranged from very low to moderate quality, suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects.","Iron supplements taken one, two or three times a week for preventing anaemia, and its consequences in menstruating women What is the issue? Across the globe, approximately one out of three non‐pregnant women of reproductive age are anaemic; i.e. have fewer red blood cells or less haemoglobin (a red substance that combines with oxygen and carries it around the body) in each red blood cell than normal. Although there are several causes of anaemia, it very often results from sustained iron deficiency. The standard practice to prevent or treat anaemia in women has been daily iron supplementation (sometimes combined with folic acid and other vitamins and minerals) for three months. However, it is frequently associated with side effects such as nausea or constipation. Intermittent supplementation (that is, the consumption of supplements one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. Why is this important? Women with anaemia may have less energy for physical work and become more prone to infections. Most women throughout the world enter pregnancy with anaemia, putting them at greater risk of having low birth‐weight babies and other complications during delivery. Some scientists believe that taking iron a few times a week – instead of every day – can help women with anaemia to feel better and improve their haemoglobin without giving them as many side effects. If women have fewer side effects, they may be more likely to take iron supplements more regularly and for longer periods. What evidence did we find? We reviewed the evidence in February 2018. We included 25 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to one or more treatment groups) involving 10,996 women. We included studies examining the administration of intermittent iron supplements versus no intervention, a placebo (dummy pill) or the same supplements given on a daily basis. Most studies were implemented in school settings and were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one‐third of the included studies did not provide a funding source. The findings show that women receiving intermittent supplementation with iron alone, or in combination with folic acid or other nutrients, were less likely to be anaemic or iron deficient than those women who received no iron supplements or a placebo. They also had higher concentrations of haemoglobin and ferritin (a protein that carries iron) but reported more side effects. In addition, the findings indicate that intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in reducing the prevalence of anaemia and increasing haemoglobin concentrations, with fewer side effects. It may have reduced the risk of having iron deficiency also, but it had no effect on raising ferritin concentrations more than the daily dose. We found scarce evidence on the effect of intermittent supplementation compared to placebo or daily supplementation on iron deficiency anaemia, all‐cause morbidity, disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance. What does this mean? Intermittent iron supplementation in menstruating women may be an effective intervention for reducing anaemia and improving haemoglobin concentrations compared to no treatment, placebo or daily supplementation. Intermittent supplementation may be associated with fewer side effects compared to daily supplementation. The findings were not affected by whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline (starting point for comparisons). The evidence base was of overall low quality.",CD009218
"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a group of complex and heterogenous conditions, characterised by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and which left untreated leads to right‐heart failure and death. PH includes World Health Organisation (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Group 2 consists of PH due to left‐heart disease (PH‐LHD); Group 3 comprises PH as a result of lung diseases or hypoxia, or both; Group 4 includes PH due to chronic thromboembolic occlusion of pulmonary vasculature (CTEPH), and Group 5 consists of cases of PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms including haematological, systemic, or metabolic disorders. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase vasodilation and inhibit proliferation. Objectives To determine the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children. Search methods We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 26 September 2018. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared any PDE5 inhibitor versus placebo, or any other PAH disease‐specific therapies, for at least 12 weeks. We include separate analyses for each PH group. Data collection and analysis We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full‐text versions of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were: change in WHO functional class, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD), and mortality. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic parameters, quality of life/health status, dyspnoea, clinical worsening (hospitalisation/intervention), and adverse events. When appropriate, we performed meta‐analyses and subgroup analyses by severity of lung function, connective tissue disease diagnosis, and radiological pattern of fibrosis. We assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach and created 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (odds ratio (OR) 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 40 to 56; 8 trials, 880 participants), and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high‐certainty evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one additional death was 32 participants. There was an increased risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, especially headache (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.92; 5 trials, 848 participants), gastrointestinal upset (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.48; 5 trials, 848 participants), flushing (OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.83 to 9.26; 3 trials, 748 participants), and muscle aches and joint pains (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.99; 4 trials, 792 participants). Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to placebo whilst on other PAH‐specific therapy were limited by the small number of included trials. Those PAH participants on PDE5 inhibitors plus combination therapy walked 19.66 metres further in six minutes (95% CI 9 to 30; 4 trials, 509 participants) compared to placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence). There were limited trials comparing PDE5 inhibitors directly with other PAH‐specific therapy (endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs)). Those on PDE5 inhibitors walked 49 metres further than on ERAs (95% CI 4 to 95; 2 trials, 36 participants) (low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in WHO functional class or mortality across both treatments. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to left‐heart disease (PH‐LHD). The quality of data were low due to imprecision and inconsistency across trials. In those with PH‐LHD there were reduced odds of an improvement in WHO functional class using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; 3 trials, 285 participants), and those using PDE5 inhibitors walked 34 metres further compared to placebo (95% CI 23 to 46; 3 trials, 284 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to lung disease/hypoxia, mostly in COPD. Data were of low quality due to imprecision of effect and inconsistency across trials. There was a small improvement of 27 metres in 6MWD using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo in those with PH due to lung disease. There was no evidence of worsening hypoxia using PDE5 inhibitors, although data were limited. Three studies compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo or other PAH‐specific therapy in chronic thromboembolic disease. There was no significant difference in any outcomes. Data quality was low due to imprecision of effect and heterogeneity across trials. Authors' conclusions PDE5 inhibitors appear to have clear beneficial effects in group 1 PAH. Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil are all efficacious in this clinical setting, and clinicians should consider the side‐effect profile for each individual when choosing which PDE5 inhibitor to prescribe. While there appears to be some benefit for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in PH‐left‐heart disease, it is not clear based on the mostly small, short‐term studies, which type of left‐heart disease stands to benefit. These data suggest possible harm in valvular heart disease. There is no clear benefit for PDE5 inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease or chronic thromboembolic disease. Further research is required into the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension secondary to left‐heart disease, and cautious consideration of which subset of these patients may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors. Future trials in PH‐LHD should be sufficiently powered, with long‐term follow‐up, and should include invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six‐minute walk distance, and clinical worsening.","PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension Review question: We wanted to review whether a group of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors (which may work to open up the vessels in the lung) can help people with pulmonary hypertension (increased pressures in the blood vessels of the lungs). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question, and found 36 studies. Why the review is important: Approximately three people in every 1000 have pulmonary hypertension, due to different causes. This can lead to reduced exercise capacity, reduced quality of life, increased hospitalisations, and early death. A group of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors may improve blood circulation in the right heart and lungs. We wanted to make sure that if these drugs are being used, there is evidence of benefit and little or no harm. Main findings: We included 36 studies with 2999 people. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Most trials involved adults, and two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included those with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (inherited, unknown, due to connective tissue diseases). People who were given PDE5 inhibitors were compared with those not given PDE5 inhibitors. This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, on average people walked 48 meters further in six minutes (8 trials, 880 people). They also improved their functional class (reducing the physical limitations associated with PH), and were less likely to die (high‐certainty evidence). They were also more likely to have side effects, including headache, flushing and muscle aches. Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to left‐heart disease. This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, these people were on average able to walk 34 metres further in six minutes (3 trials, 284 people; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and some idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). When given PDE5 inhibitors, they were able to walk 27 meters further in six minutes (low‐certainty evidence), but with no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Three trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to blood clots; there was no significant difference in outcomes for those who used PDE5 inhibitors compared to those who did not. Limitations: There was good‐quality evidence for those with pulmonary arterial hypertension, giving us some confidence that the results are correct. The evidence for those with pulmonary hypertension due to heart disease was less certain. The quality of evidence in this group was low because there were few trials, small numbers of people taking part, and the trials were quite different from each other, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.",CD012621
"Background Clinical guidelines recommend outpatient care for the majority of people with an eating disorder. The optimal use of inpatient treatment or combination of inpatient and partial hospital care is disputed and practice varies widely. Objectives To assess the effects of treatment setting (inpatient, partial hospitalisation, or outpatient) on the reduction of symptoms and increase in remission rates in people with: 1. Anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa; 2. Bulimia nervosa and other eating disorders. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 2 July 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 20 November 2015). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (6 July 2018). We ran a forward citation search on the Web of Science to identify additional reports citing any of the included studies, and screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews identified during our searches. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that tested the efficacy of inpatient, outpatient, or partial hospital settings for treatment of eating disorder in adults, adolescents, and children, whose diagnoses were determined according to the DSM‐5, or other internationally accepted diagnostic criteria. We excluded trials of treatment setting for medical or psychiatric complications or comorbidities (e.g. hypokalaemia, depression) of an eating disorder. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane procedures to select studies, extract and analyse data, and interpret and present results. We extracted data according to the DSM‐5 criteria. We used the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias. We used the mean (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data outcomes, and the risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes. We included the 95% confidence interval (CI) with each result. We presented the quality of the evidence and estimate of effect for weight or body mass index (BMI) and acceptability (number who completed treatment), in a 'Summary of findings' table for the comparison for which we had sufficient data to conduct a meta‐analysis. Main results We included five trials in our review. Four trials included a total of 511 participants with anorexia nervosa, and one trial had 55 participants with bulimia nervosa. Three trials are awaiting classification, and may be included in future versions of this review. We assessed a risk of bias from lack of blinding of participants and therapists in all trials, and unclear risk for allocation concealment and randomisation in one study. We had planned four comparisons, and had data for meta‐analyses for one. For anorexia nervosa, there may be little or no difference between specialist inpatient care and active outpatient or combined brief hospital and outpatient care in weight gain at 12 months after the start of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.05; 2 trials, 232 participants; low‐quality evidence). People may be more likely to complete treatment when randomised to outpatient care settings, but this finding is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.88; 3 trials, 319 participants; very low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for these outcomes because of risks of bias, small numbers of participants and events, and variable level of specialist expertise and intensity of treatment. We had no data, or data from only one trial for the primary outcomes for each of the other three comparisons. No trials measured weight or acceptance of treatment for anorexia nervosa, when comparing inpatient care provided by a specialist eating disorder service and health professionals and a waiting list, no active treatment, or treatment as usual. There was no clear difference in weight gain between settings, and only slightly more acceptance for the partial hospital setting over specialist inpatient care for weight restoration in anorexia nervosa. There was no clear difference in weight gain or acceptability of treatment between specialist inpatient care and partial hospital care for bulimia nervosa, and other binge eating disorders. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether any treatment setting was superior for treating people with moderately severe (or less) anorexia nervosa, or other eating disorders. More research is needed for all comparisons of inpatient care versus alternate care.","Inpatient hospital care compared to outpatient or day care for people with eating disorders Why is this review important? International clinical practice guidelines recommend that overall, people with eating disorders should receive their treatment in an outpatient setting. Most people also prefer to avoid a hospital admission, as it takes more time and resources. However, it is not known if outpatient care is as effective as more intensive inpatient or partial (day) hospital care, or if it is more acceptable for people. Those who are at medical or psychiatric risk of harm or suicide, and those with anorexia nervosa who are severely underweight or rapidly losing weight may not be safe in an outpatient setting. Who will be interested in this review? People with lived experience of eating disorders and people who care for them will be interested in this review. Which studies were included in the review? We searched medical databases and trial registers to find randomised controlled studies that compared inpatient care to partial hospital care or outpatient care, alone or in combination, to July 2018. We included four trials that included 511 people with anorexia nervosa, and one trial of 55 people with bulimia nervosa. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was not enough evidence from trials to support any one setting for people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorders. There was no clear difference in weight gain for people with anorexia nervosa who were treated in different settings, but they seemed more likely to complete treatment when some or all of it was offered in settings outside the hospital. The evidence was low or very low‐quality, so we are uncertain about these results. What should happen next? We need more trials comparing inpatient to outpatient or day care for people with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, when it is medically safe to consider less intensive care settings.",CD010827
"Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest inherited life‐shortening illness in white populations, caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a salt transporter. This mutation mainly affects the airways where excess salt absorption dehydrates the airway lining leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. Consequently, thick, sticky mucus accumulates making the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; respiratory failure often ensues. Other complications include malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Increased understanding of the condition has allowed pharmaceutical companies to design mutation‐specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular defect. CFTR potentiators target mutation classes III and IV and aim to normalise airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, which in turn impacts on the chronic infection and inflammation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of CFTR potentiators on clinically important outcomes in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and online clinical trial registries. Last search: 21 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing CFTR potentiators to placebo in people with CF. A separate review examines trials combining CFTR potentiators with other mutation‐specific therapies. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias in included trials and used GRADE to assess evidence quality. Trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results We included five RCTs (447 participants with different mutations) lasting from 28 days to 48 weeks, all assessing the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low, mainly due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data and selective reporting) and imprecision of results, particularly where few individuals experienced adverse events. Trial design was generally well‐documented. All trials were industry‐sponsored and supported by other non‐pharmaceutical funding bodies. F508del (class II) (140 participants) One 16‐week trial reported no deaths, or changes in quality of life (QoL) or lung function (either relative or absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (moderate‐quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in ivacaftor and placebo groups, but there was no difference between groups (low‐quality evidence); there was also no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. There was also no difference in weight. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, mean difference (MD) ‐2.90 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.60 to ‐0.20). G551D (class III) (238 participants) The 28‐day phase 2 trial (19 participants) and two 48‐week phase 3 trials (adult trial (167 adults), paediatric trial (52 children)) reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor in the adult trial at 24 weeks, MD 8.10 (95% CI 4.77 to 11.43) and 48 weeks, MD 8.60 (95% CI 5.27 to 11.93 (moderate‐quality evidence). The adult trial reported a higher relative change in FEV1 with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 16.90% (95% CI 13.60 to 20.20) and 48 weeks, MD 16.80% (95% CI 13.50 to 20.10); the paediatric trial reported this at 24 weeks, MD 17.4% (P < 0.0001)) (moderate‐quality evidence). These trials demonstrated absolute improvements in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32). The phase 3 trials reported increased cough, odds ratio (OR) 0.57 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) and episodes of decreased pulmonary function, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.82) in the placebo group; ivacaftor led to increased dizziness in adults, OR 10.55 (95% CI 1.32 to 84.47). There was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Fewer participants taking ivacaftor developed serious pulmonary exacerbations; adults taking ivacaftor developed fewer exacerbations (serious or not), OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). A higher proportion of participants were exacerbation‐free at 24 weeks with ivacaftor (moderate‐quality evidence). Ivacaftor led to a greater absolute change from baseline in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32); weight also increased at 24 weeks, MD 2.37 kg (95% CI 1.68 to 3.06) and 48 weeks, MD 2.75 kg (95% CI 1.74 to 3.75). Sweat chloride concentration decreased at 24 weeks, MD ‐48.98 mmol/L (95% CI ‐52.07 to ‐45.89) and 48 weeks, MD ‐49.03 mmol/L (95% CI ‐52.11 to ‐45.94). R117H (class IV) (69 participants) One 24‐week trial reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 8.40 (95% CI 2.17 to 14.63), but no relative changes in lung function were reported (moderate‐quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in both groups, but there was no difference between groups; there was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. No changes in absolute change in FEV1 or weight were reported. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, MD ‐24.00 mmol/L (CI 95% ‐24.69 to ‐23.31). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence supporting the use of ivacaftor in people with the F508del mutation. Both G551D phase 3 trials demonstrated a clinically relevant impact of ivacaftor on outcomes at 24 and 48 weeks in adults and children (over six years of age) with CF. The R117H trial demonstrated an improvement in the respiratory QoL score, but no improvement in respiratory function. As new mutation‐specific therapies emerge, it is important that trials examine outcomes relevant to people with CF and their families and that adverse events are reported robustly and consistently. Post‐market surveillance is essential and ongoing health economic evaluations are required.","Ivacaftor (marketed as Kalydeco®), a new specific therapy for cystic fibrosis Review question How does ivacaftor affect clinical outcomes (survival, quality of life and lung function) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background In people with CF, airway surfaces do not have enough water because of an abnormal protein; this makes it difficult to clear thick and sticky mucus, which leads to lung infections. Ivacaftor works on the abnormal protein in people with some mutations to allow the airways retain more water and better clear mucus, so fewer lung infections develop. Ivacaftor was aimed at people with class III and IV mutations, and has been studied in people with G551D (class III), R117H (class IV) and F508del (class II) mutations. Trial characteristics We included five trials (447 participants) comparing ivacaftor to placebo (dummy treatment with no active medication) lasting between four and 48 weeks. Three trials enrolled a total of 238 people with at least one copy of the G551D mutation, one trial enrolled 140 people with two copies of the F508del mutation and one enrolled 69 people with at least one copy of the R117H mutation. The evidence is up to date as of 21 November 2018. Key results F508del mutation The trial did not report any deaths or show improvements in lung function, quality of life scores or weight. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. Sweat chloride concentrations were reduced with ivacaftor. G551D mutation No deaths were reported. Both children and adults taking ivacaftor showed improvements in lung function, but only adults reported higher quality of life scores. People given placebo reported more coughing and experienced more episodes of decreased lung function; more adults taking ivacaftor reported episodes of dizziness. Similar numbers of people taking ivacaftor and placebo delayed the course of medication, or withdrew from the trial altogether, due to side effects (e.g. psychological issues, liver disease, severe breathing problems). There were more serious pulmonary exacerbations whilst taking placebo compared to ivacaftor. Adults taking ivacaftor were admitted to hospital less often and had fewer courses of intravenous antibiotics for exacerbations. Both children and adults and children increased their weight with ivacaftor. There was a drop in sweat chloride concentrations with ivacaftor. R117H mutation No deaths occurred in this trial. While quality of life scores improved with ivacaftor, lung function did not. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. There was no difference in weight; but as for other mutations there was a reduction in sweat chloride concentration with ivacaftor.    Evidence suggests that ivacaftor is an effective treatment for people (over six years of age) with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation, but not for those with the F508del or R117H mutations. Quality of the evidence In most trials, individuals were put into different treatment groups at random with equal chances of being given either placebo or ivacaftor; no one could work out which treatment the next person would receive, so that healthier people did not receive ivacaftor and make the results seem better. We were not sure whether anyone involved in the trial knew who was receiving which treatment and how this might affect results. No trials reported all results clearly; sometimes they did not report them in a way that we could use in the review and sometimes they did not report the data at all. This affected our certainty regarding the overall results. Information about some side effects was limited as not many people experienced them, therefore, it is difficult to judge whether there was a difference between treatment groups We judged the evidence in this review to be moderate to low quality. Trial funding sources All trials were sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. The National Institute of Health (NIH), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and other non‐pharmaceutical funding bodies also supported the trials.",CD009841
"Background Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes more deaths in children aged under five years than any other single cause. Chest physiotherapy is widely used as adjuvant treatment for pneumonia. Physiotherapy is thought to help remove inflammatory exudates, tracheobronchial secretions, and airway obstructions, and reduce airway resistance to improve breathing and enhance gas exchange. This is an update of a review published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy with regard to time until clinical resolution in children (from birth to 18 years) of either gender with any type of pneumonia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (22 February 2018), Embase (22 February 2018), CINAHL (22 February 2018), LILACS (22 February 2018), Web of Science (22 February 2018), and PEDro (22 February 2018). We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to identify planned, ongoing, and unpublished trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes of interest were mortality, duration of hospital stay, and time to clinical resolution. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included three new RCTs for this update, for a total of six included RCTs involving 559 children aged from 29 days to 12 years with pneumonia who were treated as inpatients. Pneumonia severity was described as moderate in one trial, severe in two trials, and was not stated in three trials .  The studies assessed five different interventions: effects of conventional chest physiotherapy (3 studies, 211 children), positive expiratory pressure (1 study, 72 children), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (1 study, 94 children), bubble CPAP (bCPAP) (1 study, 225 children), and assisted autogenic drainage (1 studies, 29 children). The included studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Blinding of participants was not possible in most studies, but we considered that the outcomes were unlikely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. One study of bCPAP reported that three deaths occurred in children in the physiotherapy group (N = 79), and 20 deaths in the control group (N = 146) (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.90; 225 children; low‐quality evidence). One study of assisted autogenic drainage (N = 29), and one study of conventional chest physiotherapy (N = 72) reported no deaths occurred. It is uncertain whether chest physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) reduced hospital stay duration (days) (mean difference (MD) 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.76; 4 studies; low‐quality evidence). There was variation among clinical parameters used to define clinical resolution. Two small studies found no difference in resolution of fever between children in the physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy and assisted autogenic drainage) and control groups. Of five studies that considered peripheral oxygen saturation levels, only two reported that use of chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy) showed a greater improvement in peripheral oxygen saturation levels. However, it was unclear whether respiratory rate (breaths/min) improved after conventional chest physiotherapy (MD ‐2.25, 95% CI ‐5.17 to 0.68; 2 studies, 122 children; low‐quality evidence). Two studies assessed adverse events (number of events), but only one study reported any events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67; 2 studies, 254 children; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions We could draw no reliable conclusions concerning the use of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia due to the small number of included trials with differing study characteristics and statistical presentation of data. Future studies should consider the following key points: appropriate sample size with adequate power to detect expected differences, standardisation of chest physiotherapy techniques, appropriate outcomes (such as duration of leukocytosis, and airway clearance), and adverse effects.","Chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in children Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of any type of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia. Background Pneumonia is a type of lung infection and the biggest cause of worldwide deaths among children aged up to five years. Chest physiotherapy may contribute to children's recovery because it can help to open airways and assist breathing. Search date The evidence is current to 22 February 2018. Study characteristics We included six studies involving 559 children with pneumonia aged from 29 days to 12 years. This is an update of a review published in 2013 and includes three new studies. Studies were conducted in hospitals in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. Pneumonia was described as moderate to severe in three studies, but severity was not described in three studies. All studies included children who received physiotherapy and others who did not. All children also received standard medical treatment for pneumonia. The studies assessed deaths, length of hospital stay, time taken to attain normal test results (no signs of pneumonia), and adverse events. Study funding sources Four studies reported sources of funding (a child health agency, university, government research grants), and two did not report study funding sources. Key results One study reported fewer deaths in children who received bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP). Physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) were not associated with shorter hospital stays. Two studies reported improvements in blood oxygen levels after chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy). No clear improvement in respiratory rate was observed after conventional chest physiotherapy. Based on the available evidence, we could not confirm if chest physiotherapy is beneficial or not for children with pneumonia. Quality of the evidence We assessed the overall quality of the evidence as low due to inadequate study methods and design, differing results among studies, and few data.",CD010277
"Background The use of short‐acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates. Objectives To assess the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Search methods For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short‐acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. None of the included trials defined all‐cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate‐certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta‐analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low‐certainty evidence). The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was ‐0.03% (95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between ‐0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short‐acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low‐certainty evidence). No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes‐related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects. Authors' conclusions Our analysis found no clear benefits of short‐acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient‐relevant outcomes, like all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long‐term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues on patient‐relevant outcomes.","Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus Review question Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? Background Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. Study characteristics We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018. Key results We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.",CD013228
"Background More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) are diagnosed every year worldwide and this is rising. Much of the increase has been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV‐positive OPSCC patients are often younger and have significantly improved survival relative to HPV‐negative patients. Traditional management of OPSCC has been with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, as this was shown to have similar survival to open surgery but with significantly lower morbidity. Techniques have evolved, however, with the development of computerised planning and intensity‐modulated radiotherapy, and of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Acute and late toxicities associated with chemoradiotherapy are a significant burden for OPSCC patients and with an ever‐younger cohort, any strategies that could decrease treatment‐associated morbidity should be investigated. Objectives To assess the effects of de‐intensified adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in comparison to standard adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in patients treated with minimally invasive transoral surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for resectable HPV‐positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 26 April 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary HPV‐positive squamous cell tumours originating from the oropharyngeal mucosa. Tumours were classified as T1‐4a with or without nodal spread and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by de‐intensified adjuvant therapy (either omission of chemotherapy or reduced‐dose radiotherapy). The comparator was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy or standard‐dose radiotherapy. The treatments received were of curative intent and patients had not undergone any prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease‐related survival was to be studied where possible) and disease‐free survival, measured at one, two, three and five years. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of swallowing ability and voice, measured at one, six, 12 and 24 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results We did not identify any completed RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. However, three eligible studies are in progress: ADEPT is a phase III trial comparing postoperative radiotherapy with or without cisplatin in HPV‐positive T1‐4a OPSCC patients. Included patients must have received minimally invasive surgery and demonstrated extra‐capsular spread from disease in the neck. ECOG‐E3311 is a phase II trial of treatment for HPV‐positive locally advanced OPSCC (stages III‐IVa + IVb without distant metastasis). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium‐risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced‐dose radiotherapy. PATHOS is a phase III trial of treatment for HPV‐positive OPSCC (T1‐3, N0‐2b). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium‐risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced‐dose radiotherapy. High‐risk patients are randomised to radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of high‐quality randomised controlled trials studying treatment de‐escalation after minimally invasive surgery in patients with HPV‐positive OPSCC. However, trials that will meet the inclusion criteria for this review are in progress with results expected between 2021 and 2023.","Reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy compared to standard‐dose treatment after keyhole surgery for throat cancer caused by human papillomavirus Review question What are the effects of reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment compared to standard‐dose treatment after keyhole surgery for throat cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)? Background More than 400,000 cases of cancer of the throat are diagnosed each year and this is increasing, with HPV being a significant factor. Throat cancer caused by this virus often affects younger patients but has a better prognosis than non‐viral throat cancer. Traditional treatment for throat cancer is with radiotherapy and chemotherapy as this had been shown to have similar survival outcomes to surgery but with fewer side effects. However, treatments have evolved, such as computerised planning and improvements in radiotherapy, and the development of keyhole surgery, which have the potential for fewer side effects. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy do have long‐term negative effects on quality of life. With younger patients being affected, any way of reducing these side effects should be investigated. Study characteristics In April 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had compared reduced‐dose radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment with standard‐dose treatment. We were interested in the outcomes of overall survival and disease‐free survival, as well as the effects on swallowing ability and voice. Our searches did not identify any completed RCTs, however three relevant studies are ongoing and the first results are expected between 2021 and 2023. Key results Currently there is no high‐quality evidence comparing these two treatments, however such trials are in progress.",CD012939
"Background Problem alcohol use is common among people who use illicit drugs (PWID) and is associated with adverse health outcomes. It is also an important factor contributing to a poor prognosis among drug users with hepatitis C virus (HCV) as it impacts on progression to hepatic cirrhosis or opioid overdose in PWID. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in PWID (users of opioids and stimulants). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, from inception up to August 2017, and the reference lists of eligible articles. We also searched: 1) conference proceedings (online archives only) of the Society for the Study of Addiction, International Harm Reduction Association, International Conference on Alcohol Harm Reduction and American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence; and 2) online registers of clinical trials: Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, Center Watch and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions with other psychosocial treatment, or treatment as usual, in adult PWIDs (aged at least 18 years) with concurrent problem alcohol use. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included seven trials (825 participants). We judged the majority of the trials to have a high or unclear risk of bias. The psychosocial interventions considered in the studies were: cognitive‐behavioural coping skills training (one study), twelve‐step programme (one study), brief intervention (three studies), motivational interviewing (two studies), and brief motivational interviewing (one study). Two studies were considered in two comparisons. There were no data for the secondary outcome, alcohol‐related harm. The results were as follows. Comparison 1: cognitive‐behavioural coping skills training versus twelve‐step programme (one study, 41 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol abstinence assessed with Substance Abuse Calendar and breathalyser at one year: risk ratio (RR) 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10 to 55.06); and retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.29), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was very low. Comparison 2: brief intervention versus treatment as usual (three studies, 197 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured as scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) at three months: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07 (95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.37); and retention in treatment, measured at three months: RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.13), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low. Comparison 3: motivational interviewing versus treatment as usual or educational intervention only (three studies, 462 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured as scores on the AUDIT or ASSIST at three months: SMD 0.04 (95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.37); and retention in treatment, measured at three months: RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.43), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low. Comparison 4: brief motivational intervention (BMI) versus assessment only (one study, 187 participants) More people reduced alcohol use (by seven or more days in the past month, measured at six months) in the BMI group than in the control group (RR 1.67; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.60). There was no difference between groups for the other primary outcome, retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.02), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was moderate. Comparison 5: motivational interviewing (intensive) versus motivational interviewing (one study, 163 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured using the Addiction Severity Index‐alcohol score (ASI) at two months: MD 0.03 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.08); and retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 17.63 (95% CI 1.03 to 300.48), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low. Authors' conclusions We found low to very low‐quality evidence to suggest that there is no difference in effectiveness between different types of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among people who use illicit drugs, and that brief interventions are not superior to assessment‐only or to treatment as usual. No firm conclusions can be made because of the paucity of the data and the low quality of the retrieved studies.","Which talking therapies work for people who use drugs and also have alcohol problems? Review question We wanted to see whether talking therapies reduce drinking in adult users of illicit drugs (mainly opioids and stimulants). We also wanted to find out whether one type of therapy is more effective than another. Background Drinking alcohol above the low‐risk drinking limits can lead to serious alcohol use problems or disorders. Drinking above those limits is common in people who also have problems with other drugs. It worsens their physical and mental health. Talking therapies aim to identify an alcohol problem and motivate an individual to do something about it. Talking therapies can be given by trained doctors, nurses, counsellors, psychologists, etc. Talking therapies may help reduce alcohol use but we wanted to find out if they can help people who also have problems with other drugs. Search date : the evidence is current to August 2017. Study characteristics We found seven studies that examined five talking therapies among 825 people with drug problems. Cognitive‐behavioural coping skills training (CBCST) is a talking therapy that focuses on changing the way people think and act. The twelve‐step programme is based on theories from Alcoholics Anonymous and aims to motivate the person to develop a desire to stop using drugs or alcohol. Motivational interviewing (MI) helps people to explore and resolve doubts about changing their behaviour. It can be delivered in group, individual and intensive formats. Brief motivational interviewing (BMI) is a shorter MI that takes 45 minutes to three hours. Brief interventions are based on MI but they take only five to 30 minutes and are often delivered by a non‐specialist. Six of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health or by the Health Research Board; one study did not report its funding source. Key results We found that the talking therapies led to no differences, or only small differences, for the outcomes assessed. These included abstinence, reduced drinking, and substance use. One study found that there may be no difference between CBCST and the twelve‐step programme. Three studies found that there may be no difference between brief intervention and usual treatment. Three studies found that there may be no difference between MI and usual treatment or education only. One study found that BMI is probably better at reducing alcohol use than usual treatment (needle exchange), but found no differences in other outcomes. One study found that intensive MI may be somewhat better than standard MI at reducing severity of alcohol use disorder among women, but not among men and found no differences in other outcomes. It remains uncertain whether talking therapies reduce alcohol and drug use in people who also have problems with other drugs. High‐quality studies are missing and are needed. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was moderate for brief and intensive motivational interviewing, but low for brief interventions and standard motivational interviewing, and very low for CBCST versus twelve‐step programme.",CD009269
"Background Higher intakes of foods containing omega‐3 long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), such as fish, during pregnancy have been associated with longer gestations and improved perinatal outcomes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of omega‐3 LCPUFA, as supplements or as dietary additions, during pregnancy on maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes and longer‐term outcomes for mother and child. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register,  ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (16 August 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing omega‐3 fatty acids (as supplements or as foods, stand‐alone interventions, or with a co‐intervention) during pregnancy with placebo or no omega‐3, and studies or study arms directly comparing omega‐3 LCPUFA doses or types. Trials published in abstract form were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias in trials and assessed quality of evidence for prespecified birth/infant, maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results In this update, we included 70 RCTs (involving 19,927 women at low, mixed or high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes) which compared omega‐3 LCPUFA interventions (supplements and food) compared with placebo or no omega‐3. Overall study‐level risk of bias was mixed, with selection and performance bias mostly at low risk, but there was high risk of attrition bias in some trials. Most trials were conducted in upper‐middle or high‐income countries; and nearly half the trials included women at increased/high risk for factors which might increase the risk of adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Preterm birth < 37 weeks  (13.4% versus 11.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.97; 26 RCTs, 10,304 participants; high‐quality evidence) and  early preterm birth < 34 weeks  (4.6% versus 2.7%; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.77; 9 RCTs, 5204 participants; high‐quality evidence) were both lower in women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no omega‐3.  Prolonged gestation > 42 weeks  was probably increased from 1.6% to 2.6% in women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no omega‐3 (RR 1.61 95% CI 1.11 to 2.33; 5141 participants; 6 RCTs;  moderate‐quality evidence ). For infants, there was a possibly reduced risk of  perinatal death  (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03; 10 RCTs, 7416 participants; moderate‐quality evidence: 62/3715 versus 83/3701 infants) and possibly fewer  neonatal care admissions  (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 9 RCTs, 6920 participants;  moderate‐quality evidence  ‐ 483/3475 infants versus 519/3445 infants). There was a reduced risk of  low birthweight  (LBW) babies (15.6% versus 14%; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 15 trials, 8449 participants; high‐quality evidence); but a possible small increase in  large‐for‐gestational age  (LGA) babies (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36; 6 RCTs, 3722 participants; moderate‐quality evidence, for omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no omega‐3. Little or no difference in  small‐for‐gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction  (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 8 RCTs, 6907 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) was seen. For the  maternal outcomes , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of omega‐3 on  induction post‐term  (average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.98; 3 trials, 2900 participants; low‐quality evidence),  maternal serious adverse events  (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.72; 2 trials, 2690 participants; low‐quality evidence),  maternal admission to intensive care  (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.63; 2 trials, 2458 participants; low‐quality evidence), or  postnatal depression  (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.77; 2 trials, 2431 participants; low‐quality evidence). Mean  gestational length  was greater in women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA (mean difference (MD) 1.67 days, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.39; 41 trials, 12,517 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and  pre‐eclampsia  may possibly be reduced with omega‐3 LCPUFA (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.01; 20 trials, 8306 participants; low‐quality evidence). For the  child/adult outcomes,  very few differences between antenatal omega‐3 LCPUFA supplementation and no omega‐3 were observed in  cognition, IQ, vision, other neurodevelopment and growth outcomes, language and behaviour  (mostly low‐quality to very low‐quality evidence). The effect of omega‐3 LCPUFA on  body mass index at 19 years  (MD 0, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.83; 1 trial, 243 participants; very low‐quality evidence) was uncertain. No data were reported for development of  diabetes  in the children of study participants. Authors' conclusions In the overall analysis,  preterm birth < 37 weeks  and  early preterm birth < 34 weeks  were reduced in women receiving omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no omega‐3. There was a possibly reduced risk of  perinatal death  and of  neonatal care admission , a reduced risk of  LBW  babies; and possibly a small increased risk of  LGA  babies with omega‐3 LCPUFA. For our GRADE quality assessments, we assessed most of the important perinatal outcomes as high‐quality (e.g. preterm birth) or moderate‐quality evidence (e.g. perinatal death). For the other outcome domains (maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes) GRADE ratings ranged from moderate to very low, with over half rated as low. Reasons for downgrading across the domain were mostly due to design limitations and imprecision. Omega‐3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy is an effective strategy for reducing the incidence of preterm birth, although it probably increases the incidence of post‐term pregnancies. More studies comparing omega‐3 LCPUFA and placebo (to establish causality in relation to preterm birth) are not needed at this stage. A further 23 ongoing trials are still to report on over 5000 women, so no more RCTs are needed that compare omega‐3 LCPUFA against placebo or no intervention. However, further follow‐up of completed trials is needed to assess longer‐term outcomes for mother and child, to improve understanding of metabolic, growth and neurodevelopment pathways in particular, and to establish if, and how, outcomes vary by different types of omega‐3 LCPUFA, timing and doses; or by characteristics of women.","Omega‐3 fatty acid addition during pregnancy What is the issue? Do omega‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) taken during pregnancy ‐ either as supplements or as dietary additions in food (such as some types of fish) ‐ improve health outcomes for babies and their mothers? This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2006. Why is this important? Preterm birth (babies born before 37 weeks pregnancy (gestation)) is a leading cause of disability or death in the first five years of life. Fish and fish oil contain omega‐3 LCPUFA (particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and have been associated with longer pregnancies. So it is suggested that additional omega‐3 LCPUFAs in pregnancy may reduce the number of babies born preterm and may improve outcomes for children and mothers. However, many pregnant women do not eat fish very often. Encouraging pregnant women to eat fatty fish (which generally have low toxin levels) or to use omega‐3 LCPUFA supplements may improve children’s and women's health. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2006. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence in August 2018 and found 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; this type of trial provides the most reliable results) (involving 19,927 women). Most trials evaluated a group of women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA and compared them with a group of women who received something that looked like omega‐3 LCPUFA but did not contain it (placebo) or received no omega‐3. The trials were mostly undertaken in upper‐middle or high‐income countries. Some studies included women at increased risk of preterm birth. The quality of the evidence from the included studies ranged from high to very low; this affected the certainty of the findings for different outcomes. We found the incidence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks) and very preterm birth (before 34 weeks) was lower in women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no additional omega‐3. There were also fewer babies with low birthweight. However, omega‐3 LCPUFA probably increased the incidence of pregnancies continuing beyond 42 weeks, although there was no difference identified in induction of labour for post‐term pregnancies. The risk of the baby dying or being very sick and going to neonatal intensive care may be lower with omega‐3 LCPUFA compared with no omega‐3. We did not see any differences between groups for serious adverse events for mothers or in postnatal depression. Very few differences between the omega‐3 LCPUFA groups and no omega‐3 groups were observed in child development and growth. Eleven trials reported that they had received industry funding. When we omitted these trials from the main outcomes (such as preterm birth and very preterm birth) it made very little, or no difference, to the results. What does this mean? Increasing omega‐3 LCPUFA intake during pregnancy, either through supplements or in foods, may reduce the incidence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks and before 34 weeks) and there may be less chance of having a baby with a low birthweight. Women who take omega‐3 LCPUFA supplements during pregnancy may also be more likely to have longer pregnancies. More studies are underway and their results will be included in a further update of this review. Future studies could consider if and how outcomes may vary in different populations of women, and could test different ways of increasing omega‐3 LCPUFA during pregnancy.",CD003402
"Background Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) affects about one billion people worldwide. It is important as it is a major risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction. However, it remains a challenge for the medical profession as many people with hypertension have blood pressure (BP) that is not well controlled. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupuncture has the potential to lower BP. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for lowering blood pressure in adults with primary hypertension. Search methods We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (February 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2017, Issue 2; MEDLINE (February 2017); Embase (February 2017), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 2015), VIP Database (January 2015), the World Health Organisation Clinical Trials Registry Platform (February 2017)  and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2017). There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention (acupuncture used alone or add‐on) with no treatment, a sham acupuncture or an antihypertensive drug in adults with primary hypertension. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. They extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and telephoned or emailed the authors of the studies to ask for missing information. A third review author resolved disagreements. Outcomes included change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), withdrawal due to adverse effects, and any adverse events. We calculated pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes using a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model where appropriate. Main results Twenty‐two RCTs (1744 people) met our inclusion criteria. The RCTs were of variable methodological quality (most at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding). There was no evidence for a sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture; only one trial investigated a sustained effect and found no BP lowering effect at three and six months after acupuncture. Four sham acupuncture controlled trials provided very low quality evidence that acupuncture had a short‐term (one to 24 hours) effect on SBP (change) ‐3.4 mmHg (‐6.0 to ‐0.9) and DBP ‐1.9 mmHg (95% CI ‐3.6 to ‐0.3). Pooled analysis of eight trials comparing acupuncture with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and seven trials comparing acupuncture to calcium antagonists suggested that acupuncture lowered short‐term BP better than the antihypertensive drugs. However, because of the very high risk of bias in these trials, we think that this is most likely a reflection of bias and not a true effect. As a result, we did not report these results in the 'Summary of findings' table. Safety of acupuncture could not be assessed as only eight trials reported adverse events. Authors' conclusions At present, there is no evidence for the sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture that is required for the management of chronically elevated BP. The short‐term effects of acupuncture are uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. The larger effect shown in non‐sham acupuncture controlled trials most likely reflects bias and is not a true effect. Future RCTs must use sham acupuncture controls and assess whether there is a BP lowering effect of acupuncture that lasts at least seven days.","Acupuncture for primary hypertension in adults Background Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects about one billion people worldwide. Moreover, hypertension increases the risk of stroke and heart attack. Acupuncture is an important part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at defined points. Acupuncture has been used to lower blood pressure and relieve symptoms of hypertension. Study characteristics We performed a systematic review of medical databases to find clinical trials that compared the effects of acupuncture to controls (sham (pretend) acupuncture, no treatment, or medicines) on blood pressure and safety in adults with hypertension. The results are current to February 2017. Key results and certainty of the evidence We found 22 trials including 1744 people. The trials did not look at death and general health. Four trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture and suggested a small short‐lasting (one to 24 hours) reduction in blood pressure. The other trials were of very poor quality. There was no evidence for a long‐lasting lowering of blood pressure by acupuncture that would be useful in the treatment of hypertension. We could not assess the safety of acupuncture as few trials reported this. At present, there is no evidence that acupuncture is useful in the management of long‐lasting hypertension. Future trials must be designed to measure a sustained blood pressure lowering effect of acupuncture.",CD008821
"Background Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often recommended for symptomatic patients with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis who have failed conservative treatment. Postoperative care has been felt to be critical for both maintaining the surgical patency of the operated sinuses and improving patient symptoms. Debridement of the sinonasal cavities is one such postoperative care measure that has frequently been studied in the literature, often with conflicting conclusions. Objectives To assess the effects of postoperative sinonasal debridement versus no debridement following endoscopic sinus surgery. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); PubMed; EMBASE; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 21 May 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing postoperative nasal debridement versus no debridement in adult patients with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. We included studies in which the patients acted as self‐controls (i.e. one side of the nose underwent debridement and the other side did not) only for the secondary endoscopy outcomes. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were: health‐related quality of life, disease severity (patient‐reported symptom scores) and significant adverse effects (bleeding requiring intervention, severe pain, iatrogenic injury). Secondary outcomes were: postoperative endoscopic appearance of the sinonasal surgical cavities (endoscopic scores), recorded use of postoperative medical treatment and rate of revision surgery. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included four studies (152 participants), with a follow‐up duration ranging from three months to 12 months. In two studies patients acted as self‐controls, i.e. one side of the nose underwent debridement and the other side did not ('split‐nose' studies). The risk of bias in all studies was high, mostly due to the inability to blind the patients to the debridement procedure. Primary outcomes Disease‐specific health‐related quality of life scores Only one study (58 participants) provided data for  disease‐specific health‐related quality of life . At six months follow‐up, lower disease‐specific health‐related quality of life scores, measured using the Sino‐Nasal Outcome Test‐22 (SNOT‐22, range 0 to 110), were noted in the debridement group but the difference was not statistically significant (9.7 in the debridement group versus 10.3 in the control group, P = 0.47) ( low‐quality evidence ). Disease severity (patient‐reported symptom score) Only one study (60 participants) provided data for  disease severity  measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) score. No significant differences in total symptom score were observed between groups postoperatively ( low‐quality evidence ). Significant adverse effects Significant adverse effects  related to the debridement procedure were not reported in any of the included studies, however it is not clear whether data regarding adverse effects were not collected or if none were indeed observed in any of the included studies. Secondary outcomes All four studies assessed the postoperative endoscopic appearance of the sinonasal cavities  using the Lund‐Kennedy score (range 0 to 10). A pooled analysis of endoscopic scores in the two non 'split‐nose' studies revealed better endoscopic scores in the debridement group, however this was not a statistically significant difference (mean difference ‐0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.35 to 0.72; I² = 0%; two studies; 118 participants) ( low‐quality evidence ). A sub‐analysis of the adhesion formation component of the endoscopic score was available for all four studies and revealed a significantly lower adhesion rate in the debridement group (risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68; I² = 29%; four studies; 152 participants). Analysis of the number needed to treat to benefit revealed that for every three patients undergoing debridement, the endoscopic score would be decreased by one point in one patient. For every five patients undergoing debridement adhesion formation would be prevented in one patient. Use of postoperative medical treatment  was reported in all studies, all of which recommended nasal douching. Steroids (systemic or nasal) were administered in two studies. However, the data were very limited and heterogeneous, therefore we could not analyse the impact of concomitant postoperative medical treatment. The  rate of revision surgery  was not reported in any of the included studies, however it is not clear whether these data were not recorded or if there were no revision surgeries in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain about the effects of postoperative sinonasal debridement due to high risk of bias in the included studies and the low quality of the evidence. Sinonasal debridement may make little or no difference to disease‐specific health‐related quality of life or disease severity.  Low‐quality  evidence suggests that postoperative debridement is associated with a significantly lower risk of adhesions at three months follow‐up. Whether this has any impact on longer‐term outcomes is unknown.","Debridement of the nasal and sinus cavities in the postoperative care of patients who have had endoscopic sinus surgery for rhinosinusitis Review question What are the benefits and harms of postoperative debridement of the nasal and sinus cavities in patients who have had endoscopic sinus surgery for rhinosinusitis? Background Endoscopic sinus surgery is often used for patients with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis when medical treatment has been unsuccessful. After surgery, several care measures have been suggested to help patients recover. One such measure is sinonasal debridement, which means removal of blood clots, crusts and secretions from the nasal and sinus cavities, a procedure that is usually performed under local anaesthesia. Study characteristics We included four studies with a total of 152 adult participants. These studies were conducted in several countries (Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada). All of them compared debridement to no debridement after endoscopic sinus surgery. The minimum follow‐up time in the studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. Only one study reported health‐related quality of life scores and only one reported disease severity scores. However, all four studies reported scores for the appearance of the sinonasal cavities viewed through an endoscope. Adverse effects of this procedure and rates of revision surgery were not reported in any of these studies. Key results Health‐related quality of life and disease severity scores were not significantly different between those patients who underwent debridement and those who did not. All four studies demonstrated better post‐surgical endoscopic appearance in the debridement group, although the size of improvement was not statistically significant. A lower rate of intranasal scarring was noted in the patient group that underwent debridement. Nonetheless, the overall evidence for all of these outcomes is of low quality. Quality of the evidence We identified several problems or potential problems in these studies. The most important was that in each study a different protocol was used for the number of debridement interventions performed per patient and the time interval between each such intervention. In addition, the numbers of patients in the study groups were relatively small. We therefore determined the overall quality of the evidence to be low for all outcomes. The evidence in this review is up to date to May 2018.",CD011988
"Background This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2016. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair‐wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure‐free and go into long‐term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are commonly used broad‐spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first‐line treatment for focal onset seizures, and is used in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first‐line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low‐ and middle‐income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these trials are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy. Objectives To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure with carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalised), or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). Search methods For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 24 May 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialized Register and CENTRAL; MEDLINE; the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or phenobarbitone in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures. Data collection and analysis This was an individual participant data (IPD), review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure. Our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post‐randomisation, time to six‐month remission, time to 12‐month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial‐specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI. Main results We included 13 trials in this review and IPD were available for 836 individuals out of 1455 eligible individuals from six trials, 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for phenobarbitone and for first seizure and treatment failure outcomes a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. Results for the primary outcome of the review were: time to treatment failure for any reason related to treatment (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 676 participants: 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86, moderate‐quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to adverse events (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 619 participants: 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97, low‐quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 487 participants: 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78, moderate‐quality evidence), showing a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine compared to phenobarbitone. For our secondary outcomes, we did not find any statistically significant differences between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone: time to first seizure post‐randomisation (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 822 participants: 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38, moderate‐quality evidence), time to 12‐month remission (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants: 1.09, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.40, low‐quality evidence), and time to six‐month remission pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 683 participants: 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24, low‐quality evidence). Results of these secondary outcomes suggest that there may be an association between treatment effect in terms of efficacy and seizure type; that is, that participants with focal onset seizures experience seizure recurrence later and hence remission of seizures earlier on phenobarbitone than carbamazepine, and vice versa for individuals with generalised seizures. It is likely that the analyses of these outcomes were confounded by several methodological issues and misclassification of seizure type, which could have introduced the heterogeneity and bias into the results of this review. Limited information was available regarding adverse events in the trials and we could not compare the rates of adverse events between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone. Some adverse events reported on both drugs were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, drowsiness, motor and cognitive disturbances, dysmorphic side effects (such as rash), and behavioural side effects in three paediatric trials. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence from this review suggests that carbamazepine is likely to be a more effective drug than phenobarbitone in terms of treatment retention (treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or adverse events or both). Moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence from this review also suggests an association between treatment efficacy and seizure type in terms of seizure recurrence and seizure remission, with an advantage for phenobarbitone for focal onset seizures and an advantage for carbamazepine for generalised onset seizures. However, some of the trials contributing to the analyses had methodological inadequacies and inconsistencies that may have impacted upon the results of this review. Therefore, we do not suggest that results of this review alone should form the basis of a treatment choice for a patient with newly onset seizures. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow‐up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.","Carbamazepine versus phenobarbitone monotherapy (single drug treatment) for epilepsy This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in Issue 12, 2016 of the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews . Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures, in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain; and focal onset seizures, in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). Focal seizures may become generalised (secondary generalisation), and move from one part of the brain throughout the brain. For around 70% of people with epilepsy, a single antiepileptic medication can control generalised onset or focal onset seizures. This review applies to people with focal seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) and people with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures, a specific generalised seizure type. This review does not apply to people with other generalised seizure types such as absence seizures or myoclonic seizures, as the recommended treatments for these seizure types are different. Worldwide, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are commonly used antiepileptic drugs, however, carbamazepine is used more commonly in the USA and Europe because of concerns over side‐effects associated with phenobarbitone, particularly concerns over behavioural changes in children treated with phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low‐ and middle‐income countries in Africa, Asia, and South America because of the low cost of the drug. Objective The aim of this review was to compare how effective these drugs are at controlling seizures, to find out if they are associated with side effects that may result in individuals stopping the medication, and to inform a choice between these medications. Methods The last search for trials was in May 2018. We assessed the evidence from 13 clinical trials in which people received either carbamazepine or phenobarbitone and their treatment was decided randomly. We were able to combine data for 836 people from six of the 13 trials; for the remaining 619 people from seven trials, data were not available to use in this review. Key results Results of the review suggest that people are likely to stop taking phenobarbitone treatment earlier than carbamazepine treatment, because of seizure recurrence, side‐effects of the drug, or both. Results also suggest that recurrence of seizures after starting treatment with phenobarbitone may happen later than treatment with carbamazepine (and therefore a seizure free period of 6 months or 12 months may occur earlier with phenobarbitone than with carbamazepine) for people with focal onset seizures, and vice‐versa for people with generalised onset seizures. Some side effects reported by people taking carbamazepine and people taking phenobarbitone were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, motor problems (such as poor co‐ordination), cognitive problems (poor memory), rashes and other skin problems. Behavioural side effects such as aggression were reported on both drugs in three trials in children. Quality of the evidence Some of the trials contributing data to the review had methodological problems, which may have introduced bias and inconsistent results into this review, and some individuals over the age of 30 with newly diagnosed generalised onset seizures may have had their seizure type wrongly diagnosed. These problems may have affected the results of this review and we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be moderate to low quality. We do not suggest using the results of this review alone for making a choice between carbamazepine or phenobarbitone for the treatment of epilepsy. We recommend that all future trials comparing these drugs or any other antiepileptic drugs should be designed using high‐quality methods to ensure results are also of high quality.",CD001904
"Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that is characterised by positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions; negative symptoms, such as flattened affect, thought disorder (disrupted speech), and lack of motivation; and cognitive symptoms, such as problems with memory and attention. Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Although antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for people with schizophrenia, in most countries mental health services usually provide a range of add‐on interventions, including occupational therapy. This is a complex intervention designed to support and enable continued participation in daily life through engagement in activities and occupations meaningful to the individual. Occupational therapists are professionals trained to deliver therapy where the emphasis is on improving occupational function and participation rather than treating symptoms, and uses a wide range of methods based on the needs of individuals. However, similar interventions may also be delivered by staff not trained as occupational therapists. Objectives To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. Main results The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full‐text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists.","Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others Review question Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. Searching for evidence On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. Evidence found We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. Conclusions At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",CD012398
"Background Caesarean section rates are increasing globally. The factors contributing to this increase are complex, and identifying interventions to address them is challenging. Non‐clinical interventions are applied independently of a clinical encounter between a health provider and a patient. Such interventions may target women, health professionals or organisations. They address the determinants of caesarean births and could have a role in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐clinical interventions intended to reduce unnecessary caesarean section. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers in March 2018. We also searched websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measures were: caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and instrumental birth. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We narratively described results of individual studies (drawing summarised evidence from single studies assessing distinct interventions). Main results We included 29 studies in this review (19 randomised trials, 1 controlled before‐after study and 9 interrupted time series studies). Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries and none took place in low‐income countries. The studies enrolled a mixed population of pregnant women, including nulliparous women, multiparous women, women with a fear of childbirth, women with high levels of anxiety and women having undergone a previous caesarean section. Overall, we found low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence that the following interventions have a beneficial effect on at least one primary outcome measure and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of adverse effects. Interventions targeted at women or families Childbirth training workshops for mothers alone may reduce caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.89) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.36). Childbirth training workshops for couples may reduce caesarean section (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.16). We judged this one study with 60 participants to have low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes above. Nurse‐led applied relaxation training programmes (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43; 104 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 147 participants, low‐certainty evidence) may reduce caesarean section. Psychoeducation may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.61; 371 participants, low‐certainty evidence). The control group received routine maternity care in all studies. There were insufficient data on the effect of the four interventions on maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity. Interventions targeted at healthcare professionals Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication slightly reduces the risk of overall caesarean section (mean difference in rate change ‐1.9%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.1; 149,223 participants). Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with audit and feedback also slightly reduces the risk of caesarean section (risk difference (RD) ‐1.8%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.2; 105,351 participants). Physician education by local opinion leader (obstetrician‐gynaecologist) reduced the risk of elective caesarean section to 53.7% from 66.8% (opinion leader education: 53.7%, 95% CI 46.5 to 61.0%; control: 66.8%, 95% CI 61.7 to 72.0%; 2496 participants). Healthcare professionals in the control groups received routine care in the studies. There was little or no difference in maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity between study groups. We judged the certainty of evidence to be high. Interventions targeted at healthcare organisations or facilities Collaborative midwifery‐labourist care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties), versus a private practice model of care, may reduce the primary caesarean section rate. In one interrupted time series study, the caesarean section rate decreased by 7% in the year after the intervention, and by 1.7% per year thereafter (1722 participants); the vaginal birth rate after caesarean section increased from 13.3% before to 22.4% after the intervention (684 participants). Maternal and neonatal mortality were not reported. We judged the certainty of evidence to be low. We studied the following interventions, and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates or had uncertain effects. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: antenatal education programmes for physiologic childbirth; antenatal education on natural childbirth preparation with training in breathing and relaxation techniques; computer‐based decision aids; individualised prenatal education and support programmes (versus written information in pamphlet). Low‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: psychoeducation; pelvic floor muscle training exercises with telephone follow‐up (versus pelvic floor muscle training without telephone follow‐up); intensive group therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy and childbirth psychotherapy); education of public health nurses on childbirth classes; role play (versus standard education using lectures); interactive decision aids (versus educational brochures); labourist model of obstetric care (versus traditional model of obstetric care). We are very uncertain as to the effect of other interventions identified on caesarean section rates as the certainty of the evidence is very low. Authors' conclusions We evaluated a wide range of non‐clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section, mostly in high‐income settings. Few interventions with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence, mainly targeting healthcare professionals (implementation of guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion, implementation of guidelines combined with audit and feedback, physician education by local opinion leader) have been shown to safely reduce caesarean section rates. There are uncertainties in existing evidence related to very‐low or low‐certainty evidence, applicability of interventions and lack of studies, particularly around interventions targeted at women or families and healthcare organisations or facilities.","Non‐clinical interventions for reducing unnecessary caesarean section What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether non‐clinical interventions, which aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, such as providing education to healthcare workers and mothers, are safe and effective. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Key messages We studied a wide range of non‐clinical interventions that aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, mostly in high‐income countries. Based on high‐quality evidence, few interventions have been shown to reduce caesarean section rates without adverse effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. These interventions are mainly aimed at healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, physicians) and involve using: clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) to provide education to healthcare professionals. What was studied in this review? Caesarean section is an operation used to prevent and reduce complications of childbirth. While it can be a life‐saving procedure for both the mother and baby, caesarean section is not without harm and should only be carried out when necessary. Caesarean sections increase the likelihood of bleeding, maternal infections and infant breathing problems, among other complications. The number of caesarean sections performed has been increasing worldwide. Whilst there may be medical reasons for this increase, other factors, such as clinician convenience and maternal fears, may also be responsible. What are the main results of the review? We included 29 studies in this review. Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries; none in low‐income countries. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, we found eight of the 29 interventions included in the review to have a beneficial effect on at least one of our main outcomes with low‐, moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence, and no moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence of harm: Interventions aimed at women or families : providing childbirth training workshops for mothers and couples; relaxation training programmes led by nurses; psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes; and psychoeducation. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence from the studies was low. Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals:  using clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; using clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and having opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) provide education to healthcare professionals. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence was high. Interventions aimed at healthcare organisations or facilities : collaborative midwifery‐labourist model of care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties) compared to a private model of care. The quality of evidence was low. We studied a number of other interventions and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates, or had uncertain effects. Limited data were available on possible harms associated with the interventions examined in this review. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence is current to March 2018.",CD005528
"Background This is the second update of the review first published in the Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 2) and later updated (2014, Issue 9). Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour antigen‐specific anti‐tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. Objectives Primary objective   • To assess the clinical efficacy of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer as evaluated by tumour response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or cancer antigen (CA)‐125 levels, response to post‐immunotherapy treatment, and survival differences ◦ In addition, we recorded the numbers of observed antigen‐specific humoral and cellular responses  Secondary objective   • To establish which combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies with tumour antigens provide the best immunological and clinical results Search methods For the previous version of this review, we performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 3), in the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and Embase databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (1966 to July 2009). We also conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). For the first update of this review, we extended the searches to October 2013, and for this update, we extended the searches to July 2017. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non‐randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen‐specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. Main results We included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early‐phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomised studies of CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo‐controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA‐125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well‐designed RCTs may be worthwhile. Authors' conclusions We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen‐specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer Background    Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. Review question   This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. Main findings   We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. Certainty of the evidence and conclusions   Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.",CD007287
"Background In most Western countries, obstetricians and midwives induce labour in about 25% of pregnant women. Oxytocin is an effective drug for this purpose, but associated with serious adverse effects of which uterine tachysystole, fetal distress and the need for immediate delivery are the most common. Various administration regimens such as reduced or pulsatile dosing have been suggested to minimise these. Discontinuation in the active phase of labour, i.e. when contractions are well‐established and the cervix is dilated at least 5 cm is another method which may reduce adverse effects. Objectives To assess whether birth outcomes can be improved by discontinuation of intravenous (IV) oxytocin, initiated in the latent phase of induced labour, once active phase of labour is established. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2018), Scopus,  ClinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (23 January 2018) together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing discontinued IV with continuous IV oxytocin in the active phase of induced labour. No exclusion criteria were applied in terms of parity, maternal age, ethnicity, co‐morbidity status, labour setting, gestational age, and prior caesarean delivery. Studies comparing different dosage regimens are outside the scope of this review. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Main results We found 10 completed RCTs involving 1888 women. One additional trial is ongoing. The included trials were conducted in hospital settings between February 1998 and January 2016, two in Europe (Denmark, and Greece), two in Turkey, and one each in Israel, Iran, USA, Bangladesh, India, and Thailand. Most trials included full‐term singleton pregnancies with a fetus in vertex presentation. Some excluded women with cervical priming prior to induction and some excluded women with a history of prior caesarean delivery. When reported, the average age of the women ranged from 22 to 31 years, nulliparity from 45% to 68%, and pre‐pregnancy body mass index from 22 to 32. Many of the included trials had design limitations and were judged to be at either high or unclear risk of bias across a number of 'Risk of bias' domains. Four trials included a Consort flow diagram. In three, this gave details of participants delivered before the active phase of labour, and treatment compliance for those who reached that stage. One Consort diagram only provided the latter information. The data in many of the trials without such a flow diagram were implausibly compliant with treatment allocation, suggesting that there had been silent post randomisation exclusions of women delivered before the active phase of labour. We therefore conducted a secondary analysis (not in our protocol) of caesarean section among women who reached the active phase of labour and were therefore eligible for the intervention. Our analysis by 'intention‐to‐treat' found that, compared with continuation of IV oxytocin stimulation, discontinuation of IV oxytocin may reduce the  caesarean delivery rate,  risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.86, 9 trials, 1784 women, low‐level certainty. However, restricting our analysis to women who reached the active phase of labour (using 'reached active phase' as our denominator) suggests there is probably little or no difference between groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29, 4 trials, 787 women, moderate‐certainty evidence). Discontinuation of IV oxytocin probably reduces the risk of uterine tachysystole combined with abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR)  compared with continued IV oxytocin (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46, 3 trials, 486 women, moderate‐level certainty). We are uncertain about whether or not discontinuation increases the risk of  chorioamnionitis  (average RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.45, 1 trial, 252 women, very low‐level certainty). Discontinuation of IV oxytocin may have little or no impact on the  use of analgesia and epidural during labour  compared to the use of continued IV oxytocin (RR 1.04 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14, 3 trials, 556 women, low‐level certainty).  Intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) abnormalities (suspicious/pathological CTGs)  are probably reduced by discontinuing IV oxytocin (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.83, 7 trials, 1390 women, moderate‐level certainty). Compared to continuing IV oxytocin, discontinuing IV oxytocin probably has little or no impact on the incidence of  Apgar < 7 at five minutes  (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.21, 4 trials, 893 women, low‐level certainty), or and  acidotic cord gasses at birth (arterial umbilical pH < 7.10) , (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.13, 4 trials, 873 women, low‐level certainty). Many of this review's maternal and infant secondary outcomes (including maternal and neonatal mortality) were not reported in the included trials. Authors' conclusions Discontinuing IV oxytocin stimulation after the active phase of labour has been established may reduce caesarean delivery but the evidence for this was low certainty. When restricting our analysis to those trials that separately reported participants who reached the active phase of labour, our results showed there is probably little or no difference between groups. Discontinuing IV oxytocin may reduce uterine tachysystole combined with abnormal FHR. Most of the trials had 'Risk of bias' concerns which means that these results should be interpreted with caution. Our GRADE assessments ranged from very low certainty to moderate certainty. Downgrading decisions were based on study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Future research could account for all women randomised and, in particular, note those who delivered before the point at which they would be eligible for the intervention (i.e. those who had caesareans in the latent phase), or because labour was so rapid that the infusion could not be stopped in time. Future trials could adopt the outcomes listed in this review including maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal satisfaction, and breastfeeding.","Discontinuation of intravenous oxytocin used to stimulate uterine contractions in the active phase of induced labour What is the issue? Oxytocin is a natural hormone, which causes the uterus (womb) to have regular, painful contractions and labour to start. It is available as an intravenous (into a vein (IV)) drug and infused slowly to artificially stimulate labour if doctors or midwives feel that it is necessary to accelerate the birth of the baby, or if the mother requests it. In Western countries, about one in four pregnant women have labour induced, usually with prostaglandin drugs either alone or in combination with oxytocin. Risks associated with using IV oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions include the woman having contractions that are too long or too frequent (uterine hyperstimulation), which can lead to changes in the baby’s heart rate and the need for emergency caesarean. This review examines whether stopping IV oxytocin once labour is well‐established (i.e. the cervix is dilated more than halfway) reduces the associated risks for mother and baby compared to continuing with IV oxytocin. Why is this important? Stopping oxytocin infusion once active labour has started could result in a more natural childbirth, particularly if the risk of uterine overstimulation and need for immediate caesarean section is reduced. Also, the overall total dose of oxytocin the mother received would be reduced, which could lead to fewer adverse effects (e.g. maternal nausea, vomiting and headache, or changes to the baby's heart rate). What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence (January 2018) and found 10 randomised controlled studies (1888 women and their babies) conducted between February 1998 and January 2016 at hospitals in Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Iran, USA, Bangladesh, India, and Thailand. We cannot be confident in the results because of study design limitations and how the findings were reported. Stopping IV oxytocin during active labour may reduce the number of women who have a caesarean section (nine trials, 1784 women). However, when we performed another analysis including only those women who were actually in active labour, we found that there is probably little or no difference between the two groups (four trials, 787 women). Discontinuing IV oxytocin probably reduces the risk of women having contractions that become too long or too strong resulting in changes to the baby’s heart rate (three trials, 486 women). We are uncertain about whether stopping IV oxytocin or not affects the risk of having a bacterial infection of the membranes or sac inside the womb) (one trial, 252 women). Stopping IV oxytocin during labour may have little or no impact on women’s use of analgesia and epidural compared to women who continued to receive IV oxytocin (three trials, 556 women). There were probably fewer babies in the discontinued IV oxytocin group with abnormal cardiotocography results (an electronic method of measuring both the women’s contractions and the baby’s heartbeat) compared to women who continued to receive IV oxytocin (seven trials, 1390 women). Compared to continued IV oxytocin, discontinuing IV oxytocin probably has little or no impact on the number of babies with a low score on a standard test of well‐being for newborn babies (Apgar), five minutes after being born (four trials, 893 women), or another other measure of infant well‐being involving analysing blood taken from the umbilical cord once (four trials, 873 women). The included trials did not report on many of this review's outcomes, including death of the mother or her baby. What does this mean? Stopping oxytocin after the active phase of labour has started may reduce the number of women with contractions that become too long or too strong resulting in changes to the baby’s heart rate, and the risk of having a caesarean. However, the possible reduction in the risk of caesarean may be an artefact of poor study design. Better quality trials are needed. These could include in the analysis those women who did not reach the active phase of labour because their babies were delivered earlier by caesarean, and those whose labour was so rapid that the oxytocin could not be stopped in time, i.e. analysis should be by 'intention‐to‐treat"". Future studies could include the outcomes listed in this review, including women's satisfaction.",CD012274
"Background An oro‐antral communication is an unnatural opening between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus. When it fails to close spontaneously, it remains patent and is epithelialized to develop into an oro‐antral fistula. Various surgical and non‐surgical techniques have been used for treating the condition. Surgical procedures include flaps, grafts and other techniques like re‐implantation of third molars. Non‐surgical techniques include allogenic materials and xenografts. This is an update of a review first published in May 2016. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of various interventions for the treatment of oro‐antral communications and fistulae due to dental procedures. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 23 May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 May 2018), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 23 May 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. We also searched the reference lists of included and excluded trials for any randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We included RCTs evaluating any intervention for treating oro‐antral communications or oro‐antral fistulae due to dental procedures. We excluded quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over trials. We excluded studies on participants who had oro‐antral communications, fistulae or both related to Caldwell‐Luc procedure or surgical excision of tumours. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials. Two review authors assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data independently. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included only one study in this review, which compared two surgical interventions: pedicled buccal fat pad flap and buccal flap for the treatment of oro‐antral communications. The study involved 20 participants. The risk of bias was unclear. The relevant outcome reported in this trial was successful (complete) closure of oro‐antral communication. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was very low. The study did not find evidence of a difference between interventions for the successful (complete) closure of an oro‐antral communication (RR 1.00, 95% Cl 0.83 to 1.20) one month after the surgery. All oro‐antral communications in both groups were successfully closed so there were no adverse effects due to treatment failure. We did not find trials evaluating any other intervention for treating oro‐antral communications or fistulae due to dental procedures. Authors' conclusions We found very low quality evidence from a single small study that compared pedicled buccal fat pad and buccal flap. The evidence was insufficient to judge whether there is a difference in the effectiveness of these interventions as all oro‐antral communications in the study were successfully closed by one month after surgery. Large, well‐conducted RCTs investigating different interventions for the treatment of oro‐antral communications and fistulae caused by dental procedures are needed to inform clinical practice.","Treatment of communications between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus due to dental procedures Review question What evidence is available for the safe and effective treatment of openings between the mouth and main sinus caused by dental procedures? Background The floor of the main sinus near the nose is thin and lies directly above the roots of the teeth at the back of the mouth. Sometimes following infection or dental treatment, this structure becomes damaged and openings or channels between the mouth and the sinus are formed. These are known as oro‐antral communications (OAC). If the OAC is left open (then described as an oro‐antral fistula (OAF), it may become permanent, leading to long‐lasting sinus infections. This condition can be treated surgically by using flaps, grafts and other techniques; or non‐surgically using a variety of methods and materials. There is little evidence for the most effective and safe treatments for closing OACs and OAFs and clinicians who treat these conditions have identified an urgent need for this. This is an update of a review first published in May 2016. Study characteristics We searched various databases until 23 May 2018. Only one study, which was conducted in Iran, is included in our review. The study ran for two years and involved 20 people with OAC aged between 25 and 56 years. Participants were divided into two groups and two surgical treatments were compared for treating oro‐antral communications; one group was treated with pedicled buccal fat pad flap (PBFPF) and the other with buccal flap (BF). Key results and quality of evidence The study did not find evidence of a difference between PBFPF and BF in terms of successful (complete) closure of OAC. Both interventions resulted in successful closure by one month after surgery. The study did not therefore report any adverse effects of treatment failure. It may not be possible to generalise these findings because the quality of the evidence was very low, due to unclear risk of bias and the small numbers studied in the single included trial. Conclusion The evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the effects of interventions used to treat OAC or fistulae due to dental procedures. More well‐designed and well‐reported trials evaluating different interventions are needed to provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decisions.",CD011784
"Background Acupuncture has a history of traditional use in China for women's health conditions including premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but its effectiveness for this condition remains unclear. This review examined the available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture or acupressure to treat PMS. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture or acupressure for women with PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL (from inception to 21 September 2017), two clinical trial databases (from their inception to 21 September 2017), and four electronic databases in China (from their inception to 15 October 2017): Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP information/ Chinese Scientific Journals database and WANFANG. Reference lists from included articles were handsearched. Selection criteria We included studies if they randomised women with PMS and associated disorders (PMDD and late luteal phase dysphoric disorder/LPDD) to receive acupuncture or acupressure versus sham, usual care/waiting‐list control or pharmaceutical interventions mentioned by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD). If acupuncture or acupressure were combined with another therapy, these studies were also included where the additional therapy was the same in both groups. Cross‐over studies were eligible for inclusion, but only data from the first phase could be used. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed eligible studies for risk of bias, and extracted data from each study. Study authors were contacted for missing information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were overall premenstrual symptoms and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included specific PMS symptoms, response rate and quality of life. Main results Five trials (277 women) were included in this review. No trials compared acupuncture or acupressure versus other active treatments. The number of treatment sessions ranged from seven to 28. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low quality, the main limitations being imprecision due to small sample sizes and risk of bias related to detection bias and selective reporting. Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture Acupuncture may provide a greater reduction in mood‐related PMS symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐9.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐10.71 to ‐7.35, one randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 67, low‐quality evidence) and in physical PMS symptoms (MD ‐9.11, 95% CI ‐10.82 to ‐7.40, one RCT, n = 67, low‐quality evidence) than sham acupuncture, as measured by the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale (DRSP). The evidence suggests that if women have a mood score of 51.91 points with sham acupuncture, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.71 and 7.35 points lower and if women have a physical score of 46.11 points, their score with acupuncture would be between 10.82 and 7.4 points lower.There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the rate of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 7.76, three RCTs, n = 167, I 2  = 0%, very low‐quality evidence). Specific PMS symptoms were not reported There may be little or no difference between the groups in response rates. Use of a fixed‐effect model suggested a higher response rate in the acupuncture group than in the sham group (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.92; participants = 100; studies = 2; I 2  = 82%), but owing to the high heterogeneity we tested the effect of using a random‐effects model, which provided no clear evidence of benefit for acupuncture (RR 4.22, 95% CI 0.45 to 39.88, two RCTs, n = 100, I 2  = 82%, very low‐quality evidence ). Acupuncture may improve quality of life (measured by the WHOQOL‐BREF) compared to sham (MD 2.85, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.23, one RCT, n = 67,  l ow‐quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatment Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether acupuncture reduces PMS symptoms compared to a no treatment control (MD ‐13.60, 95% CI ‐15.70 to ‐11.50, one RCT, n = 14 ) . No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available on specific PMS symptoms, response rate or quality of life outcomes. Acupressure versus sham acupressure We found low‐quality evidence that acupressure may reduce the number of women with moderate to severe PMS symptoms at the end of the trial compared to sham acupressure (RR 0.64 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 97 women out of 100 in the sham acupressure group had moderate to severe PMS symptoms, the number of women in the acupressure group with moderate to severe symptoms would be 50 to 76 women. Acupressure may improve both physical (MD 24.3, 95% CI 17.18 to 31.42, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence) and mental (MD 17.17, 95% CI 13.08 to 21.26, one RCT, n = 90, low‐quality evidence) quality of life. No data were available on adverse events, specific symptoms or response rates. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence available suggests that acupuncture and acupressure may improve both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS when compared to a sham control. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of adverse events.There is no evidence comparing acupuncture or acupressure versus current ISPMD recommended treatments for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Further research is required, using validated outcome measures for PMS, adequate blinding and suitable comparator groups reflecting current best practice.","Acupuncture and acupressure for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Review question Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture or acupressure in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Background We wanted to know whether using acupuncture or acupressure therapy was better than receiving sham acupuncture, no treatment or currently recommended pharmaceutical medications for PMS such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ‐ a type of anti‐depressant). Study characteristics We found five randomised controlled trials including 277 women that examined the effect of acupuncture or acupressure in women with PMS. The evidence is current to September 2017. We also ran a smaller search in November 2017 to see if we had missed any recently published studies. Three trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, one compared acupuncture with no treatment and one compared acupressure with sham acupressure. Key results Acupuncture may reduce overall mood and physical PMS symptoms when compared to sham. Acupressure may reduce the number of women having moderate to severe PMS symptoms when compared to sham acupressure. There was not enough evidence to determine the safety of acupuncture or acupressure. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.The main limitations were imprecision due to small sample sizes (too few women in the study) and risk of bias related to blinding (where researchers or participants knew what treatment they were getting).",CD005290
"Background Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults. Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co‐morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. Objectives This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non‐APL)). Search methods We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS; instead of the pre‐planned event‐free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on‐study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA. The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate‐certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%). For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on‐study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on‐study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate‐certainty evidence). Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty‐evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).    Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on‐study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only. As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life.","Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) What is the aim of this review? This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. Key messages The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. What was studied in this review? Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. What are the main results of this review? We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.",CD011960
"Background This is the third update of a review that was originally published in the Cochrane Library in 2002, Issue 2. People with cancer, their families and carers have a high prevalence of psychological stress, which may be minimised by effective communication and support from their attending healthcare professionals (HCPs). Research suggests communication skills do not reliably improve with experience, therefore, considerable effort is dedicated to courses that may improve communication skills for HCPs involved in cancer care. A variety of communication skills training (CST) courses are in practice. We conducted this review to determine whether CST works and which types of CST, if any, are the most effective. Objectives To assess whether communication skills training is effective in changing behaviour of HCPs working in cancer care and in improving HCP well‐being, patient health status and satisfaction. Search methods For this update, we searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, PsycInfo and CINAHL up to May 2018. In addition, we searched the US National Library of Medicine Clinical Trial Registry and handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings for additional studies. Selection criteria The original review was a narrative review that included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before‐and‐after studies. In updated versions, we limited our criteria to RCTs evaluating CST compared with no CST or other CST in HCPs working in cancer care. Primary outcomes were changes in HCP communication skills measured in interactions with real or simulated people with cancer or both, using objective scales. We excluded studies whose focus was communication skills in encounters related to informed consent for research. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials and extracted data to a pre‐designed data collection form. We pooled data using the random‐effects method. For continuous data, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs). Main results We included 17 RCTs conducted mainly in outpatient settings. Eleven trials compared CST with no CST intervention; three trials compared the effect of a follow‐up CST intervention after initial CST training; two trials compared the effect of CST and patient coaching; and one trial compared two types of CST. The types of CST courses evaluated in these trials were diverse. Study participants included oncologists, residents, other doctors, nurses and a mixed team of HCPs. Overall, 1240 HCPs participated (612 doctors including 151 residents, 532 nurses, and 96 mixed HCPs). Ten trials contributed data to the meta‐analyses. HCPs in the intervention groups were more likely to use open questions in the post‐intervention interviews than the control group (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; P = 0.03, I² = 62%; 5 studies, 796 participant interviews; very low‐certainty evidence); more likely to show empathy towards their patients (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.32; P = 0.008, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 844 participant interviews; moderate‐certainty evidence), and less likely to give facts only (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.01; P = 0.05, I² = 68%; 5 studies, 780 participant interviews; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence suggesting no difference between CST and no CST on eliciting patient concerns and providing appropriate information was of a moderate‐certainty. There was no evidence of differences in the other HCP communication skills, including clarifying and/or summarising information, and negotiation. Doctors and nurses did not perform differently for any HCP outcomes. There were no differences between the groups with regard to HCP 'burnout' (low‐certainty evidence) nor with regard to patient satisfaction or patient perception of the HCPs communication skills (very low‐certainty evidence). Out of the 17 included RCTs 15 were considered to be at a low risk of overall bias. Authors' conclusions Various CST courses appear to be effective in improving HCP communication skills related to supportive skills and to help HCPs to be less likely to give facts only without individualising their responses to the patient's emotions or offering support. We were unable to determine whether the effects of CST are sustained over time, whether consolidation sessions are necessary, and which types of CST programs are most likely to work. We found no evidence to support a beneficial effect of CST on HCP 'burnout', the mental or physical health and satisfaction of people with cancer.","Do courses aimed at improving the way healthcare professionals communicate with people who have cancer impact on their physical and mental health? What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if communication skills training (CST) for healthcare professionals working with people who have cancer has an impact on how healthcare professionals communicate and on the physical and mental health of the patients.    What types of studies did we include?   We included only randomised trials (RCTs) that evaluated the impact of CST for healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses and other allied health professionals) who work with people with cancer. We included different types of CST and evaluated its impact on healthcare professionals and their patients, through the following reported outcomes: use of open questions, elicited concerns, delivery of appropriate information, empathy demonstration, use of fact contents, healthcare professional 'burnout' and patient anxiety. What are the main results of the review?   We found 17 RCTs comparing CST with no CST. The studies used encounters with real and simulated patients to measure the communication outcomes. The evidence on whether CST leads to an improvement of the use of open questions is very uncertain. However, we did show that CST probably improves healthcare professional empathy and reduces the likelihood of their giving facts only without individualising their responses to the patient's emotions or offering support. . CST probably does not have an effect on the ability of healthcare professionals to elicit concerns or to give appropriate information. Evidence suggesting that CST might prevent healthcare professional 'burnout' is of low‐certainty and it is very uncertain whether CST has an effect on patient anxiety. What do they mean?   CST probably helps healthcare professionals to empathise more with their patients, and probably improves some aspects of their communication skills. These changes might lead to better patient outcomes; however, evidence on the latter is very uncertain and more research is needed.",CD003751
"Background The use of systemic immunotherapy targets is emerging as an important treatment option for metastatic urothelial carcinoma, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate or who fail cisplatin‐based chemotherapy. One such target is the inhibition of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1) receptor and its ligand (PD‐L1) by monoclonal antibodies. Objectives To assess the effects of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Search methods We performed a Cochrane Rapid Review, limiting our search to published studies in the English language. We searched databases of the medical literature, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, as well as trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Our search extended from January 2000 to June 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials except cross‐over trials and cluster randomised trials. We excluded all other study designs. Participants included had locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy (synonymous with second‐/third‐/fourth‐line therapy). This review focused on pembrolizumab (synonyms: MK‐3475, lambrolizumab, Keytruda). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included study. The certainty of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 542 participants, which compared the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Results were reported after a median follow‐up of 14.1 months (range 9.9 to 22.1 months). Primary outcomes Pembrolizumab probably reduces the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.90; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 115 fewer deaths (191 fewer to 38 fewer) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision. Pembrolizumab may slightly improve quality of life (change from baseline to week 15 assessed with the Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; higher value reflects better quality of life; scale 0 to 100) with a mean difference (MD) of 9.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 13.50; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on disease progression (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to three fewer patients (42 fewer to 24 more) whose disease progressed per 1000 participants at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab probably improves treatment response (based on complete or partial radiologic response) with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.77; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 97 more respondents (27 more to 202 more) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision. Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on treatment‐related mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.79; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to one fewer (12 fewer to 44 more) treatment‐related deaths per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on discontinuations due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10). This corresponds to 54 fewer discontinuations per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 7 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab may reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.83, 95 CI 0.72 to 0.97; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to 107 fewer serious averse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 176 fewer). We downgraded two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Authors' conclusions The use of pembrolizumab in men with advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy probably improves overall survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. At 12 months follow‐up about 70% of those in the chemotherapy group had died, compared with 59% of those treated with pembrolizumab. We are very uncertain about the effects of pembolizumab on quality of life. Pembolizumab may also improve treatment response rates, and reduce the risk of serious adverse events, but may make little or no difference to discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events. These conclusions are based on a single trial that was sponsored by the producer of pembrolizumab.","Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for treating advanced bladder cancer after recurrence/progression following platinum‐based chemotherapy Review question How does pembrolizumab (a newer medicine that works through the body's immune system) compare to chemotherapy in patients with cancer of the inner lining of the urinary system, called urothelial cancer, that has either come back or worsened after treatment? Background Medications that target the body's immune system have been used for a long time to treat urothelial cancer. When the cancer has spread to other organs outside the urinary tract, patients are often treated with chemotherapy using medicines called cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum‐containing chemotherapy). However, often the cancer comes back or becomes worse despite treatment. This review considers the evidence for pembrolizumab, which is a member of a new class of medications that work through the immune sytem, and compares it to chemotherapy. Study characteristics We considered only randomised controlled trials in this Cochrane Rapid Review, as they offer the most reliable results. This review is current to 20 June 2018. Key results We found only one randomised study for our question. Participants included in this trial had metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) or advanced cancer that could not be removed by surgery, that had come back or worsened with other chemotherapy. We found that pembrolizumab probably improves overall survival a little (evidence of moderate certainty). It may improve quality of life slightly (low certainty evidence). Pembrolizumab may have little or not effect on the time for the cancer to worsen or advance (low certainty evidence). It probably improves treatment response as seen on X‐ray scans such as computer tomography (moderate certainty of evidence). Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on deaths resulting from the treatment itself (low certainty evidence) but may result in fewer patients stopping treatment due to unwanted side effects (low certainty evidence). It may also cause less serious side effects. These conclusions are based on a single trial paid for by the company that makes pembrolizumab. Certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low.",CD012838
"Background Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non‐pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music‐based interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of music‐based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well‐being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment. Search methods We searched  ALOIS , the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of music‐based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random‐effects models. Main results We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty‐one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta‐analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. At the end of treatment, we found low‐quality evidence that the interventions may improve emotional well‐being and quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.62; 9 studies, 348 participants) and reduce anxiety (SMD –0.43, 95% CI –0.72 to –0.14; 13 studies, 478 participants). We found low‐quality evidence that music‐based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on cognition (SMD 0.15, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.36; 7 studies, 350 participants). There was moderate‐quality evidence that the interventions reduce depressive symptoms (SMD –0.27, 95% CI –0.45 to –0.09; 11 studies, 503 participants) and overall behaviour problems (SMD –0.23, 95% CI –0.46 to –0.01; 10 studies, 442 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD –0.07, 95% CI –0.24 to 0.10; 14 studies, 626 participants). The quality of the evidence on social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain. The evidence for long‐term outcomes measured four or more weeks after the end of treatment was of very low quality for anxiety and social behaviour, and for the other outcomes, it was of low quality for little or no effect (with small SMDs, between 0.03 and 0.34). Authors' conclusions Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music‐based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well‐being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition. We are uncertain about effects on social behaviour and about long‐term effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.","Music‐based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia Background People with dementia gradually develop difficulties with memory, thinking, language and daily activities. Dementia is often associated with emotional and behavioural problems and may decrease a person's quality of life. In the later stages of dementia it may be difficult for people to communicate with words, but even when they can no longer speak they may still be able to hum or play along with music. Therapy involving music may therefore be especially suitable for people with dementia. Music therapists are specially qualified to work with individuals or groups of people, using music to try to help meet their physical, psychological and social needs. Other professionals may also be trained to provide similar treatments. Purpose of this review We wanted to see if we could find evidence that treatments based on music improve the emotional well‐being and quality of life of people with dementia. We were also interested in evidence about effects on emotional, behavioural, social or cognitive (e.g. thinking and remembering) problems in people with dementia. What we did We searched for clinical trials that measured these effects and in which people with dementia were randomly allocated to a music‐based treatment or to a comparison group. The comparison groups might have had no special treatment, or might have been offered a different activity. We required at least five sessions of treatment because we thought fewer sessions than five were unlikely to have much effect. We combined results of trials to estimate the effect of the treatment as accurately as possible. The evidence is current to 19 June 2017. What we found We found 22 trials to include in the review and we were able to combine results for at least some outcomes from 890 people. All of the people in the trials stayed in nursing homes or hospitals. Some trials compared music‐based treatments with usual care, and some compared them with other activities, such as cooking or painting. The quality of the trials and how well they were reported varied, and this affected our confidence in the results. First, we looked at outcomes immediately after a course of therapy ended. From our results, we could be moderately confident that music‐based treatments improve symptoms of depression and overall behavioural problems, but not specifically agitated or aggressive behaviour. They may also improve anxiety and emotional well‐being including quality of life, although we were less confident about these results. They may have little or no effect on cognition. We had very little confidence in our results on social interaction. Some studies also looked to see whether there were any lasting effects four weeks or more after treatment ended. However, there were few data and we were uncertain or very uncertain about the results. Further trials are likely to have a significant impact on what we know about the effects of music‐based treatments for people with dementia, so continuing research is important.",CD003477
"Background Children with acute pneumonia may be vitamin D deficient. Clinical trials have found that prophylactic vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of developing pneumonia in children. Data on the therapeutic effects of vitamin D in acute childhood pneumonia are limited. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of acute childhood pneumonia. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print; In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations; Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 4, 2017); and Embase (2010 to 28 July 2017). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 28 July 2017. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including children (aged over one month and up to five years) hospitalised with acute community‐acquired pneumonia, as defined by the WHO acute respiratory infection guidelines, that compared vitamin D supplementation with control. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we extracted the number of participants experiencing the outcome and the total number of participants in each treatment group. For continuous data, we used the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD) for each treatment group together with numbers of participants in each group. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included seven RCTs conducted in low‐income countries that involved 1529 children (780 with pneumonia and 749 with severe or very severe pneumonia). Four studies used a single 100,000 IU dose of vitamin D₃ at the onset of illness or within 24 hours of hospital admission; two used a daily dose of oral vitamin D₃ (1000 IU for children aged up to one year and 2000 IU for children aged over one year) for five days; and one used a daily dose of oral vitamin D₃ (50,000 IU) for two days. One study reported microbiological and radiological diagnosis of pneumonia. The effects of vitamin D on outcomes were inconclusive when compared with control: time to resolution of acute illness (hours) (mean difference (MD) ‐0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.14 to 4.24; 3 studies; 935 children; low‐quality evidence) mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.28; 1 study; 193 children; very low‐quality evidence); duration of hospitalisation (MD 0.49, 95% CI ‐8.41 to 9.4; 4 studies; 835 children; very low‐quality evidence) and time to resolution of fever (MD 1.66, 95% CI ‐2.44 to 5.76; 4 studies; 584 children; very low‐quality evidence). No major adverse events were reported. The GRADE assessment found very low‐quality evidence (due to serious study limitations, inconsistencies, indirectness, and imprecision) for all outcomes except time to resolution of acute illness. One study was funded by the New Zealand Aid Corporation; one study was funded by an institutional grant; and five studies were unfunded. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain as to whether vitamin D has an important effect on outcomes because the results were imprecise. No major adverse events were reported. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low to low. Several trials are ongoing and may provide additional information.","Is vitamin D an effective and safe addition to antibiotics to treat children with acute pneumonia? Review question We wanted to find out if vitamin D helps children with acute pneumonia who are also receiving antibiotic treatment get better faster. Background Pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory tract infection that affects the lungs. Treatment for pneumonia includes antibiotics, providing supplementary oxygen to air that is breathed in through a mask, and other supportive therapies. Vitamin D boosts immune defences and reduces excessive inflammation, effects that may help children recover from an acute episode of pneumonia. Search date The evidence is current to 28 July 2017. Study characteristics We included seven studies involving a total of 1529 children (780 with pneumonia (4 studies) and 749 with severe or very severe pneumonia (3 studies)) aged under 5 years from low‐income countries. In four studies, a single large dose of vitamin D was used either when the child joined the study or within 24 hours of admission to hospital; in two studies, vitamin D was used for five days; and in one study, vitamin D was used for two days. One study excluded children whose vitamin D levels were normal. One study reported the cause of children's pneumonia. Study funding sources One study was funded by the New Zealand Aid Corporation; one was funded by an institutional grant; and five studies were unfunded. Key results We are uncertain as to whether vitamin D has an important effect on outcomes due to the very‐low quality of the evidence. Vitamin D may slightly decrease the time taken to get better from acute pneumonia (by 60 minutes) and the risk of death, and Vitamin D may increase the length of time in hospital (by 30 minutes) and the time taken for fever to resolve (by 90 minutes). However, there was no significant difference between groups for these outcomes. No major adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was very low, except for time to resolution of acute illness, which we assessed as low quality. We identified problems with the study methods and reporting, resulting in lack of precision in the included studies.",CD011597
"Background Research suggests that the number of intellectually disabled people with children is increasing. Intellectual disabilities do not inevitably cause parenting difficulties, but it may impact on an individual's capacity to parent a child effectively. Children of parents with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of neglectful care, which could lead to health, developmental and behavioural problems, or increased risk of intellectual disability. Compared with other parents, those with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be involved in care proceedings. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities designed to support parenting, parent‐child relations, safe parenting or family environments, or to develop parenting skills. Search methods In July 2017, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and six other databases as well as two trials registers. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field to identify additional ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities with treatment as usual or a control group. Data collection and analysis We used standardised Cochrane methods. Main results As of July 2017, we identified four trials with 192 participants that met the review inclusion criteria. Participating parents were mostly mothers (seven fathers were included in two studies), and children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months. One study was conducted in Australia, one in Canada, one in the Netherlands, and one in the USA. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the comparison groups included in the review received treatment as usual and most of these received the index intervention after the study was complete. One study was funded by the Ontario Mental Health Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services Research Grants Program; one by the Alabama Development Disabilities Council; one by the Best Practice Parenting Education Initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services and the New South Wales Aging and Disability Department; and one by ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. It was not possible for us to conduct a meta‐analysis. The GRADE quality assessment varied from very low to moderate across the studies. Primary outcomes No study reported on the 'attainment of specific parenting skill targets'. 'Safe home practices' and 'understanding of child health': one study (30 parents, very low‐quality evidence) reported some improvements in parents' knowledge of life‐threatening emergencies, ability to recognise dangers, and identify precautions, in favour of the intervention group. It also found limited, very low‐quality evidence that parent training improved parents' ability to understand child health, implement precautions, use medicines safely, recognise child illness and symptoms, and seek medical advice (i.e. visit the doctor). Another study (22 mothers, very low‐quality evidence) reported improved attainment of skills related to childcare and safety, in favour of the intervention group. Secondary outcomes 'Parent‐child interaction': one study (40 mothers, very low‐quality evidence) reported improved maternal‐child interaction following parent training at 12 months follow‐up. Another study (83 mothers, 2 fathers, moderate‐quality evidence) reported that inclusion in the intervention group led to a steeper decline in parenting stress related to the child compared to the control group. 'Parents' retention of child': one study (22 participants; very low‐quality evidence) reported that before joining the programme nine of 11 (82%) families with a previous child had had the child removed from their care by child protection authorities due to maternal maltreatment, compared with only four of 22 (19%) families after participating in the programme (only one of these four mothers had also had a previous child removed). No study reported data on: 'return to independent care of child' or 'lifting of child‐related court order'. Authors' conclusions There is some very low‐quality evidence that some parents, mainly mothers, with intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate parenting if they are given appropriate training and support to learn the parenting skills they need. However, there are few studies exploring how interventions might work, for whom and in what circumstances. In particular, there have been few studies that include fathers with intellectual disabilities, or that explore the views of parents themselves. There is a need for larger RCTs of parenting interventions, with longer follow‐up, before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of parent training for this group of parents.","Parent training for parents with intellectual disabilities Review question Do parent training interventions help parents with intellectual disabilities to parent adequately? Background Parents with intellectual disabilities may find it more difficult than other parents to provide adequate childcare. Parent training programmes are one way of providing support. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of parent training programmes for parents with intellectual disabilities. We found four randomised controlled trials (RCT; a type of experiment where similar people are put into different groups). Search Date The evidence is current to July 2017. Study characteristics The four RCTs were conducted in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and USA, and involved 192 parents. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. All but seven of the participating parents were mothers. Children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the control groups all received treatment as usual. Study funding sources Each study was sponsored by different funders. One study was funded by the Ontario Mental Health Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services Research Grants Program. Another was funded by the Alabama Development Disabilities Council. A third was funded by the Best Practice Parenting Education Initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services and the New South Wales Aging and Disability Department. The fourth study was funded by ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. Key results Compared to those parents without parent training, the studies reported some improvements in parents in the intervention group. One study reported improvement in safe home practices, recognition of child illness and safe use of medicines, in favour of the intervention group. Another study reported improvements in childcare and safety, also in favour of the intervention group; and a third study found that parents who had attended parent training reported less child‐related parenting stress compared to the control group. A fourth study reported improvement in mother‐child interaction in the intervention group compared with the control group. No study reported that interventions caused harm. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Conclusion There is some low‐quality evidence that parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities may support their parenting. It may also help to establish good parent‐child relations. However, given the low quality of the evidence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Better‐quality research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities. These studies should include fathers and follow‐up participants over a longer time period.",CD007987
"Background Pain during dental treatment, which is a common fear of patients, can be controlled successfully by local anaesthetic. Several different local anaesthetic formulations and techniques are available to dentists. Objectives Our primary objectives were to compare the success of anaesthesia, the speed of onset and duration of anaesthesia, and systemic and local adverse effects amongst different local anaesthetic formulations for dental anaesthesia. We define success of anaesthesia as absence of pain during a dental procedure, or a negative response to electric pulp testing or other simulated scenario tests. We define dental anaesthesia as anaesthesia given at the time of any dental intervention. Our secondary objective was to report on patients' experience of the procedures carried out. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OVID SP), Embase, CINAHL PLUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, and other resources up to 31 January 2018. Other resources included trial registries, handsearched journals, conference proceedings, bibliographies/reference lists, and unpublished research. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing different formulations of local anaesthetic used for clinical procedures or simulated scenarios. Studies could apply a parallel or cross‐over design. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological approaches for data collection and analysis. Main results We included 123 studies (19,223 participants) in the review. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants) for meta‐analysis, yielding 23 comparisons of local anaesthetic and 57 outcomes with 14 different formulations. Only 10 outcomes from eight comparisons involved clinical testing. We assessed the included studies as having low risk of bias in most domains. Seventy‐three studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Fifteen studies had at least one domain with high risk of bias due to inadequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, masking of local anaesthetic cartridges for administrators or outcome assessors, or participant dropout or exclusion. We reported results for the eight most important comparisons. Success of anaesthesia When the success of anaesthesia in posterior teeth with irreversible pulpitis requiring root canal treatment is tested, 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine, may be superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine (31% with 2% lidocaine vs 49% with 4% articaine; risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 2.32; 4 parallel studies; 203 participants; low‐quality evidence). When the success of anaesthesia for teeth/dental tissues requiring surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively, was tested, 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin (66% with 3% prilocaine vs 76% with 2% lidocaine; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; 2 parallel studies; 907 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and 4% prilocaine plain (71% with 4% prilocaine vs 83% with 2% lidocaine; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; 2 parallel studies; 228 participants; low‐quality evidence) were inferior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine. Comparative effects of 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine and 4% articaine, 1:200,000 epinephrine on success of anaesthesia for teeth/dental tissues requiring surgical procedures are uncertain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.02; 3 parallel studies; 930 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Comparative effects of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1:200,000 epinephrine and both 4% articaine, 1:200,000 epinephrine (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.83; 2 cross‐over studies; 37 participants; low‐quality evidence) and 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.07 to 5.12; 2 cross‐over studies; 31 participants; low‐quality evidence) on success of anaesthesia for teeth requiring extraction are uncertain. Comparative effects of 2% mepivacaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine and both 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine (OR 3.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 23.82; 1 parallel and 1 cross‐over study; 110 participants; low‐quality evidence) and 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.45; 2 parallel studies; 68 participants; low‐quality evidence) on success of anaesthesia for teeth requiring extraction and teeth with irreversible pulpitis requiring endodontic access and instrumentation, respectively, are uncertain. For remaining outcomes, assessing success of dental local anaesthesia via meta‐analyses was not possible. Onset and duration of anaesthesia For comparisons assessing onset and duration, no clinical studies met our outcome definitions. Adverse effects (continuous pain measured on 170‐mm Heft‐Parker visual analogue scale (VAS)) Differences in post‐injection pain between 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine and 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine are small, as measured on a VAS (mean difference (MD) 4.74 mm, 95% CI ‐1.98 to 11.46 mm; 3 cross‐over studies; 314 interventions; moderate‐quality evidence). Lidocaine probably resulted in slightly less post‐injection pain than articaine (MD 6.41 mm, 95% CI 1.01 to 11.80 mm; 3 cross‐over studies; 309 interventions; moderate‐quality evidence) on the same VAS. For remaining comparisons assessing local and systemic adverse effects, meta‐analyses were not possible. Other adverse effects were rare and minor. Patients' experience Patients' experience of procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. Authors' conclusions For success (absence of pain), low‐quality evidence suggests that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine for root treating of posterior teeth with irreversible pulpitis, and 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 4% prilocaine plain when surgical procedures/periodontal treatment was provided. Moderate‐quality evidence shows that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin when surgical procedures were performed. Adverse events were rare. Moderate‐quality evidence shows no difference in pain on injection when 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine and 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine were compared, although lidocaine resulted in slightly less pain following injection. Many outcomes tested our primary objectives in simulated scenarios, although clinical alternatives may not be possible. Further studies are needed to increase the strength of the evidence. These studies should be clearly reported, have low risk of bias with adequate sample size, and provide data in a format that will allow meta‐analysis. Once assessed, results of the 34 ‘Studies awaiting classification (full text unavailable)’ may alter the conclusions of the review.","Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment Review question This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). Background An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Study characteristics Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. Key results The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. Quality of the evidence From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.",CD006487
"Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for five decades. Objectives To compare the effects of oral fluphenazine with placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. To evaluate any available economic studies and value outcome data. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (23 July 2013, 23 December 2014, 9 November 2016 and 28 December 2017 ) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We sought all randomised controlled trials comparing oral fluphenazine with placebo relevant to people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were global state and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis For the effects of interventions, a review team inspected citations and abstracts independently, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed trials. We extracted data independently. Dichotomous data were analysed using fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow‐up, but, where possible, mean differences (MD) were calculated. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by an economic review team to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results From over 1200 electronic records of 415 studies identified by our initial search and this updated search, we excluded 48 potentially relevant studies and included seven trials published between 1964 and 1999 that randomised 439 (mostly adult participants). No new included trials were identified for this review update. Compared with placebo, global state outcomes of 'not improved or worsened' were not significantly different in the medium term in one small study (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 1.12 CI 0.79 to 1.58,  very low quality of evidence ). The risk of relapse in the long term was greater in two small studies in people receiving placebo (n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.05 to 3.31,  very   low quality of evidence ), however with high degree of heterogeneity in the results. Only one person allocated fluphenazine was reported in the same small study to have died on long‐term follow‐up (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 2.38 CI 0.10 to 55.72,  low quality of evidence ). Short‐term extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly more frequent with fluphenazine compared to placebo in two other studies for the outcomes of akathisia (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.43 CI 1.23 to 9.56,  moderate quality of evidence ) and rigidity (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.54 CI 1.76 to 7.14,  moderate quality of evidence ). For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes for relapse and presented them in additional tables. Authors' conclusions The findings in this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know, but they provide quantification to support clinical impression. Fluphenazine's global position as an effective treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the outcome of this review. However, fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment and if accessible, other inexpensive drugs less associated with adverse effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia.","Fluphenazine versus Placebo for Schizophrenia Review question:  Is fluphenazine effective for the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo? Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for decades. Searching for evidence We updated the electronic search in December 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive oral fluphenazine or placebo. No new studies were found to be added in this update. Evidence found Seven trials met the review requirements and provided useable data.The evidence currently available is of poor quality and suggests that whilst fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic, it has considerable side effects. Conclusions Antipsychotic drugs are the first line and mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. They help to effectively treat psychotic symptoms such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations) and having strange beliefs (delusions). Fluphenazine was one of the first antipsychotics and has been available for around 50 years. Fluphenazine is inexpensive and in developing countries, may be one of the only drug treatments available. In most of Europe and North America, despite still being available, the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs has reduced the use of fluphenazine and its market share. Fluphenazine has debilitating side effects, including: dizziness; movement disorders such as involuntary movements or spasms; shaking and tremors; inner restlessness and the inability to sit still; and problems with blood pressure, fever and muscle stiffness. This review included seven studies and compared the effects of fluphenazine taken by mouth with placebo (‘dummy’ treatment).  In the main, the findings of the review support the widespread view that fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic but has considerable side effects, other antipsychotic drugs may well be preferable. Fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment with serious side effects, so other inexpensive antipsychotic drugs with fewer side effects may be better for people with schizophrenia. Despite this, fluphenazine has a low cost and is widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, some of fluphenazine's side effects could be expensive in terms of human suffering and personal cost of treatment. Even though fluphenazine has been used as an antipsychotic drug for decades, there are still a surprisingly small number of well‐conducted studies measuring its effectiveness and potential to cause side effects. Future large‐scale research should report on important outcomes such as improvement in mental health, relapse, hospital discharge and admission, levels of satisfaction with treatment and quality of life.

"Background Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterised by a destructive cycle of recurrent airway infection, inflammation and tissue damage. Antibiotics are a main treatment for bronchiectasis. The aim of continuous therapy with prophylactic antibiotics is to suppress bacterial load, but bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotic, leading to a loss of effectiveness. On the other hand, intermittent prophylactic antibiotics, given over a predefined duration and interval, may reduce antibiotic selection pressure and reduce or prevent the development of resistance. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current evidence for studies comparing continuous versus intermittent administration of antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis in terms of clinical efficacy, the emergence of resistance and serious adverse events. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous versus intermittent antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis, using the primary outcomes of exacerbations, antibiotic resistance and serious adverse events. Search methods On 1 August 2017 and 4 May 2018 we searched the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED. On 25 September 2017 and 4 May 2018 we also searched  www.clinicaltrials.gov , the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal, conference proceedings and the reference lists of existing systematic reviews. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults or children with bronchiectasis that compared continuous versus intermittent administration of long‐term prophylactic antibiotics of at least three months' duration. We considered eligible studies reported as full‐text articles, as abstracts only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results and full‐text reports. Main results We identified 268 unique records. Of these we retrieved and examined 126 full‐text reports, representing 114 studies, but none of these studies met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions No randomised controlled trials have compared the effectiveness and risks of continuous antibiotic therapy versus intermittent antibiotic therapy for bronchiectasis. High‐quality clinical trials are needed to establish which of these interventions is more effective for reducing the frequency and duration of exacerbations, antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of serious adverse events.","Are antibiotics more effective when given continuously or intermittently to people with bronchiectasis? Background Bronchiectasis is an incurable lung disease characterised by repeated chest infections. Antibiotics are a main form of treatment and can be taken long term to prevent chest infections from developing. This could be continuously or intermittently for a fixed period of time. However, we do not currently know which approach is the most effective for reducing the frequency and duration of exacerbations, managing antibiotic resistance and minimising side effects. Study Characteristics On 1 August 2017 we searched a wide range of sources to find clinical trials for our review. We found 268 potentially relevant results but on closer examination none of the studies met our review criteria and none could be included. Authors' conclusions There is no high‐quality evidence about whether continuously administered or intermittently administered antibiotics are safer and more helpful for people with bronchiectasis. More research is needed to evaluate which one of these methods is better for reducing chest infections, limiting resistance to antibiotic therapy and reducing serious side effects.",CD012733
"Background In children, dental caries (tooth decay) is among the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Pulp interventions are indicated for extensive tooth decay. Depending on the severity of the disease, three pulp treatment techniques are available: direct pulp capping, pulpotomy and pulpectomy. After treatment, the cavity is filled with a medicament. Materials commonly used include mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide, formocresol or ferric sulphate. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014 when insufficient evidence was found to clearly identify one superior pulpotomy medicament and technique. Objectives To assess the effects of different pulp treatment techniques and associated medicaments for the treatment of extensive decay in primary teeth. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 10 August 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2017, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 August 2017) and the Web of Science (1945 to 10 August 2017). OpenGrey was searched for grey literature. The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions that combined a pulp treatment technique with a medicament or device in children with extensive decay in the dental pulp of their primary teeth. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed 'Risk of bias'. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information when necessary. The primary outcomes were clinical failure and radiological failure, as defined in trials, at six, 12 and 24 months. We performed data synthesis with pair‐wise meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect models. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using I² coefficients. Main results We included 40 new trials bringing the total to 87 included trials (7140 randomised teeth) for this update. All were small, single‐centre trials (median number of randomised teeth = 68). All trials were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias. The 87 trials examined 125 different comparisons: 75 comparisons of different medicaments or techniques for pulpotomy; 25 comparisons of different medicaments for pulpectomy; four comparisons of pulpotomy and pulpectomy; and 21 comparisons of different medicaments for direct pulp capping. The proportion of clinical failures and radiological failures was low in all trials. In many trials, there were either no clinical failures or no radiographic failures in either study arm. For pulpotomy, we assessed three comparisons as providing moderate‐quality evidence. Compared with formocresol, MTA reduced both clinical and radiological failures, with a statistically significant difference at 12 months for clinical failure and at six, 12 and 24 months for radiological failure (12 trials, 740 participants). Compared with calcium hydroxide, MTA reduced both clinical and radiological failures, with statistically significant differences for clinical failure at 12 and 24 months. MTA also appeared to reduce radiological failure at six, 12 and 24 months (four trials, 150 participants) (low‐quality evidence). When comparing calcium hydroxide with formocresol, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of formocresol for clinical failure at six and 12 months and radiological failure at six, 12 and 24 months (six trials (one with no failures), 332 participants). Regarding pulpectomy, we found moderate‐quality evidence for two comparisons. The comparison between Metapex and zinc oxide and eugenol (ZOE) paste was inconclusive, with no clear evidence of a difference between the interventions for failure at 6 or 12 months (two trials, 62 participants). Similarly inconclusive, there was no clear evidence of a difference in failure between Endoflas and ZOE (outcomes measured at 6 months; two trials, 80 participants). There was low‐quality evidence of a difference in failure at 12 months that suggested ZOE paste may be better than Vitapex (calcium hydroxide/iodoform) paste (two trials, 161 participants). Regarding direct pulp capping, the small number of studies undertaking the same comparison limits any interpretation. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low or very low for all comparisons. One trial appeared to favour formocresol over calcium hydroxide; however, there are safety concerns about formocresol. Authors' conclusions Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth is generally successful. Many included trials had no clinical or radiological failures in either trial arm, and the overall proportion of failures was low. Any future trials in this area would require a very large sample size and follow up of a minimum of one year. The evidence suggests MTA may be the most efficacious medicament to heal the root pulp after pulpotomy of a deciduous tooth. As MTA is relatively expensive, future research could be undertaken to confirm if Biodentine, enamel matrix derivative, laser treatment or Ankaferd Blood Stopper are acceptable second choices, and whether, where none of these treatments can be used, application of sodium hypochlorite is the safest option. Formocresol, though effective, has known concerns about toxicity. Regarding pulpectomy, there is no conclusive evidence that one medicament or technique is superior to another, and so the choice of medicament remains at the clinician's discretion. Research could be undertaken to confirm if ZOE paste is more effective than Vitapex and to evaluate other alternatives. Regarding direct pulp capping, the small number of studies and low quality of the evidence limited interpretation. Formocresol may be more successful than calcium hydroxide; however, given its toxicity, any future research should focus on alternatives.","Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth Review question How effective are different options for treating extensive tooth decay in children's primary (milk) teeth to resolve the child's symptoms (typically pain, swelling, abnormal movement) and tooth signs (as shown on an x‐ray)? Background In children, tooth decay is among the most common diseases. Tooth decay in the primary teeth tends to progress rapidly, often reaching the pulp ‐ the nerves, tiny blood vessels and connective tissue that make up the centre of a tooth. Dentists often have to perform one of three pulp treatment techniques: direct pulp capping (where a healing agent is placed directly over the exposed pulp), pulpotomy (removal of a portion of the pulp) or pulpectomy (removal of all of the pulp in the pulp chamber and root canal of a tooth). The most common materials used for direct pulp capping are calcium hydroxide, the more recent but more expensive mineral trioxide aggregate, formocresol or an adhesive resin (placed directly over the tooth's nerve). After a pulpotomy, one of four materials is generally used: ferric sulphate, formocresol, calcium hydroxide or mineral trioxide aggregate. After a pulpectomy, a material is put into the space created by pulp removal. This material should not prevent the resorption of the primary tooth's root, to let the permanent tooth to grow in. Study characteristics Review authors working with Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of randomised controlled trials. The evidence is current up to August 2017. We included 87 trials that investigated the success of pulp treatment of milk teeth. The trials were published between 1989 and 2017 and provided 125 comparisons of different treatment options. Key results Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth is generally successful. The proportion of treatment failures was low, with many of the included trials having no failures with either of the treatments being compared. After a pulpotomy, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) seems to be the best material (in terms of biocompatibility and efficacy) to put into contact with the remaining root dental nerve. The evidence showed it to be less likely to fail than either calcium hydroxide or formocresol. After pulpectomy, it is not clear whether any medicament is superior to another. ZOE paste may give better results than Vitapex (calcium hydroxide/iodoform) paste, but more studies are needed to confirm this and to explore other treatment options. Regarding direct pulp capping, the small number of studies undertaking the same comparison limits any interpretation. Formocresol may be superior to calcium hydroxide in terms of clinical and radiological failure, but because of toxic effects associated with formocresol, safer alternatives should be evaluated. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence suggesting the superiority of MTA over calcium hydroxide or formocresol after pulpotomy to be moderate. For other comparisons, the quality of the evidence is low or very low, which means we cannot be certain about the findings. The low quality is due to shortcomings in the methods used within the individual trials, the small number of children included in the trials and the short‐term follow‐up after treatment. Future trials to evaluate which healing agents are best for the three pulp treatments would require a very large sample size and should follow up the participants of a minimum of one year.",CD003220
"Background Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and most commonly occurs after the menopause (75%) ( globocan.iarc.fr ). About 319,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. Endometrial cancer is commonly considered as a potentially 'curable cancer,' as approximately 75% of cases are diagnosed before disease has spread outside the uterus (FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage I). The overall five‐year survival for all stages is about 86%, and, if the cancer is confined to the uterus, the five‐year survival rate may increase to 97%. The majority of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer have early‐stage disease, leading to a good prognosis after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy), with or without radiotherapy. However, women may have early physiological and psychological postmenopausal changes, either pre‐existing or as a result of oophorectomy, depending on age and menopausal status at the time of diagnosis. Lack of oestrogen can cause hot flushes, night sweats, genital tract atrophy and longer‐term adverse effects, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. These changes may be temporarily managed by using oestrogens, in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, there is a theoretical risk of promoting residual tumour cell growth and increasing cancer recurrence. Therefore, this is a potential survival disadvantage in a woman who has a potentially curable cancer. In premenopausal women with endometrial cancer, treatment induces early menopause and this may adversely affect overall survival. Additionally, most women with early‐stage disease will be cured of their cancer, making longer‐term quality of life (QoL) issues more pertinent. Following bilateral oophorectomy, premenopausal women may develop significant and debilitating menopausal symptoms, so there is a need for information about the risk and benefits of taking HRT, enabling women to make an informed decision, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of using HRT for their individual circumstances. Objectives To assess the risks and benefits of HRT (oestrogen alone or oestrogen with progestogen) for women previously treated for endometrial cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to April, week 4, 2017) and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 18). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, that examined the efficacy of symptom relief and the safety of using HRT in women treated for endometrial cancer, where safety in this situation was considered as not increasing the risk of recurrence of endometrial cancer above that of women not taking HRT. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 2190 unique records, evaluated the full text of seven studies and included one study with 1236 participants. This study reported tumour recurrence in 2.3% of women in the oestrogen arm versus 1.9% of women receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.50; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported one woman in the HRT arm (0.16%) and three women in the placebo arm (0.49%) who developed breast cancer (new malignancy) during follow‐up (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.01; 1236 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report on symptom relief, overall survival or progression‐free survival for HRT versus placebo. However, they did report the percentage of women alive with no evidence of disease (94.3% in the HRT group and 95.6% in the placebo group) and the percentage of women alive irrespective of disease progression (95.8% in the HRT group and 96.9% in the placebo group) at the end of the 36 months' follow‐up. The study did not report time to recurrence and it was underpowered due to closing early. The authors closed it as a result of the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, which, at that time, suggested that risks of exogenous hormone therapy outweighed benefits and had an impact on study recruitment. No assessment of efficacy was reported. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is insufficient high‐quality evidence to inform women considering HRT after treatment for endometrial cancer. The available evidence (both the single RCT and non‐randomised evidence) does not suggest significant harm, if HRT is used after surgical treatment for early‐stage endometrial cancer. There is no information available regarding use of HRT in higher‐stage endometrial cancer (FIGO stage II and above). The use of HRT after endometrial cancer treatment should be individualised, taking account of the woman's symptoms and preferences, and the uncertainty of evidence for and against HRT use.","Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women previously treated for endometrial cancer The issue   Endometrial cancer develops from the lining of the womb (uterus). It is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and mainly affects women around the time of or after the menopause (the final menstrual period). At an early stage, where the cancer has not spread outside of the womb, survival rates are excellent with a five‐year survival of up to 97%. Treatment of endometrial cancer normally involves surgery to remove the womb, fallopian tubes (that connect the uterus to the ovaries) and ovaries (which produce eggs) (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy). This may cause the onset of menopausal symptoms in women diagnosed prior to the menopause, or women may already be suffering from menopausal symptoms when they are diagnosed. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. In younger menopausal women, HRT may also help to maintain bone strength and prevent osteoporosis (weak bones). However, the safety of HRT after endometrial cancer is not known. Some types of endometrial cancer cells may be stimulated to grow by oestrogen, which is the main hormone in some types of HRT. Therefore, HRT has the potential to increase the growth of endometrial cancer cells left behind after treatment (due to microscopic undetected spread outside of the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries), so promoting tumour recurrence (regrowth). Some doctors may not prescribe HRT after a diagnosis of endometrial cancer due to this theoretical risk. However, most women treated for early‐stage endometrial cancer will not have any residual cancer cells following surgery. Menopausal symptoms can severely affect quality of life and early menopause can affect long‐term health. HRT could potentially improve quality of life and long‐term health, and women treated for endometrial cancer need to be able to balance the risks and benefits of HRT to decide about their treatment. The aim of the review   The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness (does it improve symptoms) and safety of HRT in women who have been treated for endometrial cancer. Safety of HRT in this situation included effects on survival and the specific risk of endometrial cancer regrowing. What were the main findings?   We searched clinical trial databases to look for any evidence of effectiveness and safety of HRT use in women who had had endometrial cancer up to May 2017. We only found one study that randomly allocated women to receive either HRT or a placebo (pretend treatment). This found no difference in the likelihood of the cancer regrowth between the two groups. They showed that HRT may or may not increase the risk of recurrence of developing a new cancer. They did not provide any information on survival or symptom relief. However, the study was not completed due to poor recruitment into the clinical trial, so was not large enough to definitively say whether the use of HRT could be recommended after treatment for early endometrial cancer. Quality of the evidence   We are uncertain whether HRT increases the risk of recurrence after a diagnosis of endometrial cancer, as the certainty of the current evidence was very low. We identified only one randomised trial and this trial did not include enough women to definitely answer the question. This trial also had areas of potential bias that reduced our certainty in the results. What were the conclusions?   Limited, very‐low certainty, evidence suggests that HRT may have little or no effect on the risk of endometrial cancer returning for women who have been treated surgically for an early‐stage endometrial cancer. There were no data to say whether HRT had an effect on overall survival after hysterectomy for endometrial cancer.",CD008830
"Background Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‐ Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‐CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. Objectives To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‐pharmacological interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. Main results We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons. 1. Acupuncture:  (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‐CPSI score ‐5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.32 to ‐4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‐6.05, 95% CI ‐7.87 to ‐4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 2. Lifestyle modifications:  (one study, 100 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‐CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 3. Physical activity:  (one study, 85 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.69 to ‐0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 4. Prostatic massage:  (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐7.46 to ‐4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‐term follow‐up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.82 to ‐1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 7. Other interventions:  there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. Authors' conclusions Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‐pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‐important outcomes including potential treatment‐related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Intervention for treating chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain in men Review question What are the effects of non‐medicine therapies in men with longstanding pain and discomfort around their prostate and pelvis, so‐called chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)? Background CP/CPPS is a common disorder in which men feel pelvic pain or have bothersome symptoms (or both of these) when urinating. Its cause is unknown and there are many different treatments for this condition. Study characteristics The evidence was current to August 2017. We found 38 studies that were conducted between 1993 and 2016 with 3187 participants that made 23 comparisons between different treatments in men with CP/CPPS. The evaluated interventions usually implied the use of devices, medical advice or some form of physical therapy. In many cases, these therapies were given to men in an outpatient setting. Most studies did not specify their funding sources; three studies reported funding from device makers. Key results Acupuncture:  we found that acupuncture (an alternative medicine where thin needles are inserted into the skin at specific points) probably causes a significant decrease in symptoms of prostatitis and may not associated with side effects when compared with pretend acupuncture, however, it may not reduce sexual problems. It probably decreases symptoms when compared with standard medical therapy. We found no information on its effect on quality of life, depression or anxiety. Lifestyle modifications:  we are uncertain whether the recommendation of lifestyle modifications reduces symptoms when compared to the continuation of the same lifestyle. We had no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Physical activity:  we found that a physical activity programme may reduce symptoms (small effect) when compared with a non‐specific activity used as a control, however it may not reduce anxiety or depression. We have no information regarding side effects, sexual problems or quality of life. Prostatic massage:  we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases symptoms when compared with no massage. We found no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  we found that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (where shock waves are passed through the skin to the prostate) causes a significant decrease in symptoms compared to a simulated procedure. These results may not be lasting after more continued treatment. This treatment may not be associated with side effects. We have no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  we found that transrectal thermotherapy (which applies heat to the prostate and pelvic muscle area) alone or in combination with medical therapy may cause a small decrease in symptoms compared to medical therapy alone. One of the included studies reported that participants may experience transient side effects. We have no information regarding sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. There is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low in most cases, meaning that there is much uncertainty surrounding the results. The included studies were not well designed, had a small sample size and had a short follow‐up time (usually 12 weeks).",CD012551
"Background Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few hip OA treatments have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy which aims to treat disease by inserting very thin needles at specific points on the body. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture in patients with hip OA. Search methods We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase all through March 2018. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, another active treatment, or no specific treatment; and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an addition to another treatment. Major outcomes were pain and function at the short term (i.e.  <  3 months after randomization) and adverse events. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Six RCTs with 413 participants were included. Four RCTs included only people with OA of the hip, and two included a mix of people with OA of the hip and knee. All RCTs included primarily older participants, with a mean age range from 61 to 67 years, and a mean duration of hip OA pain from two to eight years. Approximately two‐thirds of participants were women. Two RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture; the other four RCTs were not blinded. All results were evaluated at short term (i.e. four to nine weeks after randomization). In the two RCTs that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture, the sham acupuncture control interventions were judged believable, but each sham acupuncture intervention was also judged to have a risk of weak acupuncture‐specific effects, due to placement of non‐penetrating needles at the correct acupuncture points in one RCT, and the use of penetrating needles not inserted at the correct points in the other RCT. For these two sham‐controlled RCTs, the risk of bias was low for all outcomes. The combined analysis of two sham‐controlled RCTs gave moderate quality evidence of little or no effect in reduction in pain for acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture. Due to the small sample sizes in the studies, the confidence interval includes both the possibility of moderate benefit and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture (120 participants; Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) ‐0.13, (95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐0.49 to 0.22); 2.1 points greater improvement with acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture on 100 point scale (i.e., absolute percent change ‐2.1% (95% CI ‐7.9% to 3.6%)); relative percent change ‐4.1% (95% CI ‐15.6% to 7.0%)). Estimates of effect were similar for function (120 participants; SMD ‐0.15, (95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.21)). No pooled estimate, representative of the two sham‐controlled RCTs, could be calculated or reported for the quality of life outcome. The four other RCTs were unblinded comparative effectiveness RCTs, which compared (additional) acupuncture to four different active control treatments. There was low quality evidence that addition of acupuncture to the routine primary care that RCT participants were receiving from their physicians was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, compared to the routine primary physician care alone, in pain (1 RCT; 137 participants; mean percent difference ‐22.9% (95% CI ‐29.2% to ‐16.6%); relative percent difference ‐46.5% (95% CI ‐59.3% to ‐33.7%)) and function (mean percent difference ‐19.0% (95% CI ‐24.41 to ‐13.59); relative percent difference ‐38.6% (95% CI ‐49.6% to ‐27.6%)). There was no statistically significant difference for mental quality of life and acupuncture showed a small, significant benefit for physical quality of life. The effects of acupuncture compared with either advice plus exercise or NSAIDs are uncertain. We are also uncertain whether acupuncture plus patient education improves pain, function, and quality of life, when compared to patient education alone. In general, the overall quality of the evidence for the four comparative effectiveness RCTs was low to very low, mainly due to the potential for biased reporting of patient‐assessed outcomes due to lack of blinding and sparse data. Information on safety was reported in four RCTs. Two RCTs reported minor side effects of acupuncture, which were primarily minor bruising, bleeding, or pain at needle insertion sites. Four RCTs reported on adverse events, and none reported any serious adverse events attributed to acupuncture. Authors' conclusions Acupuncture probably has little or no effect in reducing pain or improving function relative to sham acupuncture in people with hip osteoarthritis. Due to the small sample size in the studies, the confidence intervals include both the possibility of moderate benefits and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture. One unblinded trial found that acupuncture as an addition to routine primary physician care was associated with benefits on pain and function. However, these reported benefits are likely due at least partially to RCT participants' greater expectations of benefit from acupuncture. Possible side effects associated with acupuncture treatment were minor.","Acupuncture for hip osteoarthritis What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if acupuncture improves pain and function in people with hip osteoarthritis. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 6 relevant studies with 413 people. Key messages In people with hip osteoarthritis, at close to 8 weeks: ‐ Acupuncture probably results in little or no difference in pain or function compared to sham acupuncture. ‐ Acupuncture plus routine primary physician care may improve pain and function compared to routine primary physician care alone. ‐ We are uncertain whether acupuncture improves pain and function compared to either advice plus exercise or NSAIDs. ‐ We are uncertain whether acupuncture plus patient education improves pain or function compared to patient education alone. What was studied in the review? Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, and the hip is the second most commonly affected joint. Some drug therapies commonly used for treating hip OA have a risk for side effects. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐drug therapies, including acupuncture. According to traditional acupuncture theory, stimulating the appropriate acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles can reduce pain or improve function. In clinical trials, sham acupuncture is intended to be a placebo for true acupuncture. In sham acupuncture, the patient believes he or she is receiving true acupuncture, but the needles either do not penetrate the skin or are not placed at the correct places on the body, or both. The purpose of the sham acupuncture control is to determine whether improvements from acupuncture are due to patient beliefs in acupuncture, rather than the specific biological effects of acupuncture. However, there is controversy about sham acupuncture. It is believed that some types of sham acupuncture may produce effects that are similar to the effects of true acupuncture. What are the main results of the review? After searching for all relevant trials published up to March 2018, we found 6 trials with 413 people. All trials included primarily older participants, with mean age range from 61‐67 years, and mean duration of hip OA pain from 2‐8 years. About two‐thirds of participants were women. Two of the included trials compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture. These two sham‐controlled trials were small‐sized, but were well‐designed and of generally high methodological quality. The sham acupuncture control interventions were judged believable, but each sham acupuncture intervention was also judged to have a risk of weak acupuncture‐specific effects. This was due to placement of non‐penetrating needles at the correct acupuncture points in one trial, and use of penetrating needles not inserted at the correct points in the other. A meta‐analysis of these two trials gave moderate‐quality evidence of little or no effect in reduction in pain or improvement in function for true acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture. People who received true acupuncture had slight and non‐significant improvements on both pain and function outcomes (2 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐100 for each), compared to those people who received sham acupuncture. Due to the small sample size in the studies the confidence intervals include both the possibility of moderate benefits and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture. A quality‐of‐life pooled outcome could not be estimated. One unblinded trial gave low quality evidence that acupuncture as an addition to routine primary physician care is associated with benefits on pain, function, and physical component‐quality of life (but not mental component‐quality of life). However, these reports of benefits in trial participants who received the additional acupuncture are likely due at least partially to their  a priori  expectations of a benefit, or their preference to get randomized to acupuncture. Evidence from the 3 other unblinded trials was uncertain. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment included minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion, which were reported in 2 trials. Four trials reported on adverse events, and none reported any serious adverse events attributed to acupuncture. No trial reported on radiographic joint changes. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to 18 March 2018.",CD013010
"Background Crohn’s disease is a transmural, relapsing inflammatory condition afflicting the digestive tract. Opioid signalling, long known to affect secretion and motility in the gut, has been implicated in the inflammatory cascade of Crohn’s disease. Low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has garnered interest as a potential therapy. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn’s disease. Search methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register was performed from inception to 15 January 2018 to identify relevant studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences including Digestive Disease Week and United European Gastroenterology Week and reference lists from retrieved articles were also screened. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of low dose naltrexone (LDN) for treatment of active Crohn’s disease were included. Data collection and analysis Data were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.5). The primary outcome was induction of clinical remission defined by a Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) of  <  150 or a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) of  <  10. Secondary outcomes included clinical response (70‐ or 100‐point decrease in CDAI from baseline), endoscopic remission or response, quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results Two studies were identified (46 participants). One study assessed the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of LDN (4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in adult patients (N = 34). The other study assessed eight weeks of LDN (0.1 mg/kg, maximum 4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in pediatric patients (N = 12). The primary purpose of the pediatric study was to assess safety and tolerability. Both studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. The study in adult patients reported that 30% (5/18) of LDN treated patients achieved clinical remission at 12 weeks compared to 18% (3/16) of placebo patients, a difference that was not statistically significant (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.24). The study in children reported that 25% of LDN treated patients achieved clinical remission (PCDAI  <  10) compared to none of the patients in the placebo group, although it was unclear if this result was for the randomized placebo‐controlled trial or for the open label extension study. In the adult study 70‐point clinical response rates were significantly higher in those treated with LDN than placebo. Eighty‐three per cent (15/18) of LDN patients had a 70‐point clinical response at week 12 compared to 38% (6/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.32). The effect of LDN on the proportion of adult patients who achieved a 100‐point clinical response was uncertain. Sixty‐one per cent (11/18) of LDN patients achieved a 100‐point clinical response compared to 31% (5/16) of placebo patients (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.42). The proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic response (CDEIS decline  >  5 from baseline) was significantly higher in the LDN group compared to placebo. Seventy‐two per cent (13/18) of LDN patients achieved an endoscopic response compared to 25% (4/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18 to 7.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic remission. Endoscopic remission (CDEIS < 3) was achieved in 22% (4/18) of the LDN group compared to 0% (0/16) of the placebo group (RR 8.05; 95% CI 0.47 to 138.87). Pooled data from both studies show no statistically significant differences in withdrawals due to adverse events or specific adverse events including sleep disturbance, unusual dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue. No serious adverse events were reported in either study. GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic response, and adverse events) as low due to serious imprecision (sparse data). Authors' conclusions Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of LDN used to treat patients with active Crohn's disease. Data from one small study suggests that LDN may provide a benefit in terms of clinical and endoscopic response in adult patients with active Crohn’s disease. Data from two small studies suggest that LDN does not increase the rate of specific adverse events relative to placebo. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on very small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low due to serious imprecision. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of LDN therapy in active Crohn's disease in both adults and children.","Low dose naltrexone for treatment of active Crohn’s disease What is Crohn's disease? Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut, which can affect people anywhere from the mouth to anus. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease who are experiencing symptoms have 'active' disease. When the symptoms stop, it is called 'remission'. What is naltrexone? Naltrexone is a long‐acting opioid antagonist. It is a drug that counteracts the effects of opoid drugs. This drug is commonly used for the treatment of alcohol and opioid abuse and is taken by mouth. Specific hormones (proteins that transmit instructions in the body) that are known to be involved in pain response may be involved in the inflammation that underlies Crohn’s disease. Perhaps by giving people a low dose of naltrexone Crohn’s disease can be improved. What did the researchers investigate? The researchers studied the effectiveness and safety (i.e. side effects) of low dose naltrexone therapy for inducing remission in people with active Crohn's disease. What did the researchers find? This review identified two small randomized controlled trials that included a total of 46 participants. One study compared 12 weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (4.5 mg/day) to a placebo (i.e. a fake drug such as a sugar pill) in 34 adult patients with active Crohn’s disease. The other study compared eight weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum 4.5 mg/day) to a placebo in 12 children with active Crohn's disease. The results from both studies were imprecise with regard to the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission. The results of the study in adult patients suggest that low dose naltrexone may provide a benefit in terms of clinical response (i.e. an improvement in disease symptoms) and endoscopic response (i.e. a reduction in inflammation of the gut as shown by examining the gut with a scope). We could not tell whether low dose naltrexone led to specific side effects including sleep disturbance, unusual dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue due to the low number of people who experienced these problems in the studies. The results of this review need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. Thus no firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness and side effect profile of low dose naltrexone treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of low dose naltrexone therapy in active Crohn's disease in both adults and children.",CD010410
"Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by a parasite, which can lead to death if untreated. Poor nutritional status hastens the progression of VL infection, and VL worsens malnutrition status. Malnutrition is one of the poor prognostic factors identified for leishmaniasis. However, the effects of nutritional supplementation in people treated for VL are not known. Objectives To assess the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people being treated with anti‐leishmanial drug therapy for VL. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trial registers up to 12 September 2017. We checked conference proceedings and WHO consultative meeting reports, the reference lists of key documents and existing reviews, and contacted experts and nutritional supplement companies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomized controlled trials (quasi‐RCTs), and non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) of any oral nutritional supplement, compared to no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice alone, in people being treated for VL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature search results for studies that met the inclusion criteria. We had planned for two review authors to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of the included studies. We planned to follow the Cochrane standard methodological procedures for assessing risk of bias and analysing the data. Main results We identified no eligible studies for this review, either completed or ongoing. Authors' conclusions We found no studies, either completed or ongoing, that assessed the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people with VL who were being treated with anti‐leishmanial drug therapy. Thus, we could not draw any conclusions on the impact of these interventions on primary cure of VL, definitive cure of VL, treatment completion, self‐reported recovery from illness or resolution of symptoms, weight gain, increased skinfold thickness, other measures of lean or total mass, or growth in children. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect for nutritional supplements in people under VL treatment. It means that we did not identify research that fulfilled our review inclusion criteria. The effects of oral nutritional supplements in people with VL who are being treated with anti‐leishmanial drug therapy have yet to be determined by rigorous experimental studies, such as cluster‐randomized trials, that focus on outcomes relevant for patients. 8 May 2019 Up to date No new studies identified with search No studies were identified for inclusion in the last search (12 Sep, 2017)","Nutritional supplements for patients who are being treated for active visceral leishmaniasis What is the aim of this review The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether oral nutritional supplements could help people who were being treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). We tried to collect and analyse all relevant studies that answered this question. Key messages We found no trials, either completed or ongoing, that answered our review question. Thus, good quality evidence on the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people who are being treated with anti‐leishmanial drug therapy is needed. This evidence could be obtained if a large, well done, randomized clinical trial was undertaken. What was studied in this review VL, also known as kala‐azar, is an infection that has a worldwide distribution. It can lead to death if untreated. Malnutrition and VL are interconnected health problems. On the one hand, malnutrition may hasten the progression of the infection, while on the other hand, VL worsens the malnutrition status of the individual. Also, if a person with VL is malnourished, she or he does not respond as well to the treatment for leishmaniasis. As VL frequently affects people living in poor countries, with limited access to optimal diets, giving additional nutrients to people receiving treatment for VL may improve their nutrition, and thus, their health. We searched for trials that evaluated the effects of providing any oral nutritional supplement, compared with placebo, dietary advice, or no nutritional intervention, in people who were being treated for VL. What are the main results of this review? We found no trials, either completed or ongoing, that answered our review question. Thus, there is no high quality evidence from trials to inform healthcare professionals about the effects of oral nutritional supplements in people who are being treated for VL. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect for nutritional supplements in people under VL treatment. It means that we did not identify any eligible research for this review, and that the effects of oral nutritional supplements have yet to be determined by rigorous studies. How up‐to‐date is this review We searched for studies that had been published up to 12 September 2017.",CD012261
"Background Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal and irreversible dilatation and distortion of the smaller airways. Bacterial colonisation of the damaged airways leads to chronic cough and sputum production, often with breathlessness and further structural damage to the airways. Long‐term macrolide antibiotic therapy may suppress bacterial infection and reduce inflammation, leading to fewer exacerbations, fewer symptoms, improved lung function, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of macrolides in terms of specific bacterial eradication and the extent of antibiotic resistance. Objectives To determine the impact of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. Search methods We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted all searches on 18 January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration that compared macrolide antibiotics with placebo or no intervention for the long‐term management of stable bronchiectasis in adults or children with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography, plain film chest radiograph, or high‐resolution computed tomography. We excluded studies in which participants had received continuous or high‐dose antibiotics immediately before enrolment or before a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation, hospitalisation, and serious adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 103 records. We independently screened the full text of 40 study reports and included 15 trials from 30 reports. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each study .  We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 14 parallel‐group RCTs and one cross‐over RCT with interventions lasting from 8 weeks to 24 months. Of 11 adult studies with 690 participants, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. Four studies with 190 children used either azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. We included nine adult studies in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and two in our comparison with no intervention. We included one study with children in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and one in our comparison with no intervention. In adults, macrolides reduced exacerbation frequency to a greater extent than placebo (OR 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.54; 341 participants; three studies; I 2  = 65%; moderate‐quality evidence). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Data show no differences in exacerbation frequency between use of macrolides (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.15; 43 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence) and no intervention. Macrolides were also associated with a significantly better quality of life compared with placebo (MD ‐8.90, 95% CI ‐13.13 to ‐4.67; 68 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). We found no evidence of a reduction in hospitalisations (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.62; 151 participants; two studies; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence), in the number of participants with serious adverse events, including pneumonia, respiratory and non‐respiratory infections, haemoptysis, and gastroenteritis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.23; 326 participants; three studies; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence), or in the number experiencing adverse events (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; 435 participants; five studies; I 2  = 28%) in adults with macrolides compared with placebo. In children, exacerbation frequency was reduced more with macrolides than with placebo (IRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; 89 children; one study; low‐quality evidence). However there was no significant difference in this age group with regard to: hospitalisations (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.11; 89 children; one study; low‐quality evidence), serious adverse events, defined within the study as exacerbations of bronchiectasis or investigations related to bronchiectasis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.05; 89 children; one study; low‐quality evidence), or adverse events (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.83; 89 children; one study), in those receiving macrolides compared to placebo. The same study reported an increase in macrolide‐resistant bacteria (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.13 to 23.79; 89 children; one study), an increase in resistance to  Streptococcus pneumoniae  (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 108.19; 89 children; one study), and an increase in resistance to  Staphylococcus aureus  (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.32; 89 children; one study) with macrolides compared with placebo. Quality of life was not reported in the studies with children. Authors' conclusions Long‐term macrolide therapy may reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life, although supporting evidence is derived mainly from studies of azithromycin, rather than other macrolides, and predominantly among adults rather than children. However, macrolides should be used with caution, as limited data indicate an associated increase in microbial resistance. Macrolides are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death and other serious adverse events in other populations, and available data cannot exclude a similar risk among patients with bronchiectasis.","Macrolide antibiotics for bronchiectasis Background to the question Bronchiectasis is a long‐term respiratory condition. The airways in the lungs are damaged, and people are prone to infection. Symptoms are chronic cough and the production of sputum (coughed‐up material (phlegm) from the lower airways). Moreover, bronchiectasis is associated with a mortality rate more than twice that of the general population. Long‐term antibiotic therapy with macrolides (such as azithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin) may reduce the cycle of reinfection, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life. We wanted to do this review to look at the evidence on use of macrolides in people with bronchiectasis. This review is intended to help people such as guideline producers, doctors, and patients make decisions about whether to use or recommend macrolides. Study characteristics We found 15 studies that compared macrolides with placebo (a substance or treatment with no benefit) or no intervention. Eleven studies involved 690 adults (aged 18 years and older) and four studies involved 190 children. Among adults, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. The four studies with children used azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. This review is current to January 2018. Main results The studies on azithromycin reported improved quality of life in adults. We do not have sufficient evidence from other macrolides to make a robust judgement on their use, and we similarly have insufficient evidence from children to draw clear conclusions. Although we found only a few trials, they do show a possible increase in antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is seen when an antibiotic becomes less effective at killing the bacteria causing the chest infection. We know that macrolides are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death and other serious adverse events when they are used to treat other conditions. The data in our review suggest it is possible that people with bronchiectasis are at risk for these adverse effects when taking macrolides. Quality of the evidence Generally the limited number of studies evaluating macrolides and the variation among them indicate that we cannot be sure of the overall effect of their use in bronchiectasis. Further high‐quality studies are needed to examine the role of long‐term macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.",CD012406
"Background Vitamin B 12  deficiency is common, and the incidence increases with age. Most people with vitamin B 12  deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B 12 . Doctors may not be prescribing oral vitamin B 12  formulations because they may be unaware of this option or have concerns regarding its effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effects of oral vitamin B 12  versus intramuscular vitamin B 12  for vitamin B 12  deficiency. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS, as well as the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. The latest search date was 17 July 2017. We applied no language restrictions. We also contacted authors of relevant trials to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of oral versus IM vitamin B 12  for vitamin B 12  deficiency. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were serum vitamin B 12  levels, clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin B 12  deficiency, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, acceptability to patients, haemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume, total homocysteine and serum methylmalonic acid levels, and socioeconomic effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for important outcomes. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to the small number of included trials and substantial clinical heterogeneity. Main results Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The trials randomised 153 participants (74 participants to oral vitamin B 12  and 79 participants to IM vitamin B 12 ). Treatment duration and follow‐up ranged between three and four months. The mean age of participants ranged from 38.6 to 72 years. The treatment frequency and daily dose of vitamin B 12  in the oral and IM groups varied among trials. Only one trial had low or unclear risk of bias across all domains and outcome measures. Two trials reported data for serum vitamin B 12  levels. The overall quality of evidence for this outcome was low due to serious imprecision (low number of trials and participants). In two trials employing 1000 μg/day oral vitamin B 12 , there was no clinically relevant difference in vitamin B 12  levels when compared with IM vitamin B 12 . One trial used 2000 μg/day vitamin B 12  and demonstrated a mean difference of 680 pg/mL (95% confidence interval 392.7 to 967.3) in favour of oral vitamin B 12 . Two trials reported data on adverse events (very low‐quality evidence due to risk of performance bias, detection bias, and serious imprecision). One trial stated that no treatment‐related adverse events were seen in both the oral and IM vitamin B 12  groups. One trial reported that 2 of 30 participants (6.7%) in the oral vitamin B 12  group left the trial early due to adverse events. Orally taken vitamin B 12  showed lower treatment‐associated costs than IM vitamin B 12  in one trial (low‐quality evidence due to serious imprecision). No trial reported on clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin B 12  deficiency, health‐related quality of life, or acceptability of the treatment scheme. Authors' conclusions Low quality evidence shows oral and IM vitamin B 12  having similar effects in terms of normalising serum vitamin B 12  levels, but oral treatment costs less. We found very low‐quality evidence that oral vitamin B 12  appears as safe as IM vitamin B 12 . Further trials should conduct better randomisation and blinding procedures, recruit more participants, and provide adequate reporting. Future trials should also measure important outcomes such as the clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin B 12  deficiency, health related‐quality of life, socioeconomic effects, and report adverse events adequately, preferably in a primary care setting.","Oral vitamin B 12  compared with intramuscular vitamin B 12  for vitamin B 12  deficiency Review question Does oral vitamin B 12  have similar effects as intramuscular injections of vitamin B 12  for people with vitamin B 12  deficiency? Background Vitamin B 12  (cobalamin) is necessary for basic body functions, such as the growth and development of red blood cells and the nervous system. Vitamin B 12  deficiency (a lack of vitamin B 12 ) is very common. Many factors contribute to vitamin B 12  deficiency, such as age, blood disease, vegetarian diet, indigestion, use of drugs, as well as poor nutrition. Doctors are more likely to give vitamin B 12  using injections into the muscle (intramuscular injection) because they may be unaware of the option to use oral vitamin B 12  or uncertain about how well it works. Study characteristics We found three randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). The studies randomised 153 participants (74 participants to oral vitamin B 12  and 79 participants to intramuscular vitamin B 12 ). Treatment duration and follow‐up ranged between three and four months. The mean age of participants ranged from 39 to 72 years. Key results Two studies used 1000 μg/day oral vitamin B 12  and showed no relevant difference to intramuscularly applied vitamin B 12  with regard to vitamin B 12  blood levels. One trial used 2000 μg/day vitamin B 12  and showed higher vitamin B 12  blood levels in favour of oral vitamin B 12 . Two studies reported side effects. One study stated that no treatment‐related side effects were seen in both the oral and intramuscular vitamin B 12  groups. One study reported that 2 of 30 participants in the oral vitamin B 12  group left the trial early due to side effects. Orally taken vitamin B 12  showed lower treatment‐associated costs than intramuscular vitamin B 12  in one trial. No study reported on clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin B 12  deficiency (e.g. fatigue, depression, neurological complications), health‐related quality of life, or acceptability of the treatment scheme. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly due to the small number of included studies and the low numbers of participants in these studies.",CD004655
"Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common, unpleasant phenomenon and current therapies are not always effective for all patients. Aromatherapy has been suggested as an addition to the available treatment strategies. This review was originally published in 2012 and updated in 2017. Objectives The main objective was to establish the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy comparable to standard pharmacological treatments for PONV in adults and children. Search methods We searched CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CAM on PubMed; Informit; LILACS; and ISI Web of Science as well as grey literature sources and the reference lists of retrieved articles up to March 2017. The original search was performed in August 2011. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where aromatherapy was used to treat PONV. Interventions were all types of aromatherapy compared to placebo or with standard antiemetics. Primary outcomes were severity and duration of PONV. Secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, use of rescue antiemetics and patient satisfaction. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous outcome variables, we used a random‐effects model and calculated risk ratio (RR) with associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcome variables, we used a random‐effects model and calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) with associated 95% CI. We used the GRADE software to compile 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results We included seven new studies with 663 participants in the 2017 update; five RCTs and two CCTs. These were added to the nine previously included studies (six RCTs and three CCTs with a total of 373 participants) for a total of 16 included studies and 1036 participants in this updated review. The mean age and range data for all participants were not reported for all studies. We identified two registered trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review; however there are no results for these studies yet. Overall, the GRADE assessment of evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low. The method of randomization in 11 of the 12 included RCTs was explicitly stated and adequate. Incomplete or methodologically diverse reporting of data affected the completeness of the analysis. Data on additional aromatherapies were added in the 2017 update (blended aromatherapy products, and peppermint products). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and time points between studies affected the completeness of the analysis. In the summary of the findings of six studies, we did not find aromatherapy to be effective in reducing nausea severity in comparison to placebo (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.63 to 0.18, P value = 0.28, 241 participants, level of evidence: low). Those participants receiving aromatherapy were no more likely to be free of nausea at the end of the treatment period than those receiving placebo (RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.31 to 34.33, P value = 0.33, 4 trials, 193 participants, evidence level: very low), however they were less likely to require rescue antiemetics (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97, P value = 0.04, 7 trials, 609 participants, evidence level: low). There were no data reported on adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison. A specific comparison of peppermint aromatherapy to placebo did not show evidence of an effect on nausea severity at five minutes post‐treatment in the pooled results (SMD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.86 to 0.49, P value = 0.59, 4 trials, 115 participants, evidence level: low). There were no data reported on nausea duration, use of rescue antiemetics, adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison. When we pooled studies comparing isopropyl alcohol to standard antiemetic treatment in a GRADE summary of findings, in terms of nausea duration, there was a significant effect on the time in minutes to a 50% reduction in nausea scores (SMD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐1.43 to ‐0.78, P value < 0.00001, 3 trials, 176 participants, evidence level: moderate). Fewer participants who received isopropyl alcohol required rescue antiemetics (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98, P value = 0.04, 215 participants, 4 trials, evidence level: moderate). Two studies with 172 participants measured patient satisfaction; there were high levels of satisfaction across both aromatherapy and standard treatment groups and no differences found (evidence level: low). There were no data reported on nausea severity or adverse events for this comparison. There was no difference in effectiveness between isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation and placebo for reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue antiemetics (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.24, P value = 0.11, 291 participants, 4 trials, evidence level: very low). There were no data reported on nausea severity, nausea duration, adverse events or patient satisfaction for this comparison. Authors' conclusions Overall, for nausea severity at the end of treatment, aromatherapy may have similar effectiveness to placebo and similar numbers of participants were nausea‐free. However, this finding is based on low‐quality evidence and therefore very uncertain. Low‐quality evidence also suggests that participants who received aromatherapy may need fewer antiemetic medications, but again, this is uncertain. Participants receiving either aromatherapy or antiemetic medications may report similar levels of satisfaction with their treatment, according to low‐quality evidence.","Aromatherapy for treating postoperative nausea and vomiting Review question This review sought to evaluate the effect of aromatherapy on the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting experienced by some people immediately after having surgery. Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common side effect following surgery, with up to a third of all patients suffering moderate to severe nausea and vomiting following general anaesthesia using inhaled anaesthetics. Nausea is an abdominal discomfort or queasiness that may be accompanied by vomiting. Current pharmaceutical treatments do not always work effectively for people or they may have unpleasant adverse effects. Aromatherapy involves inhalation of the vapour of essential oils or other substances to treat or alleviate physical and emotional symptoms. Aromatherapy is sometimes recommended for treating nausea and vomiting, although currently there is not sufficient evidence to show it is effective. This review is an update of a review previously published in 2012. Study characteristics We examined a total of 16 controlled clinical studies using aromatherapy for PONV with a total of 1036 participants (seven new studies from the March 2017 searches were added to nine studies from the original review). The participants were adults except for two studies in children. The studies applied aromatherapy at the first complaint of nausea in the immediate period after surgery and measured nausea for up to two days. Aromatherapy substances used were isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), peppermint oil, ginger, or mixtures that included ginger, spearmint, peppermint and cardamom; or lavender, peppermint, ginger, and spearmint oils. The studies compared aromatherapy to saline or water placebo, controlled breathing, other aromatherapy substances, anti‐nausea medications, or a combination of these, with some studies having up to four groups. Key results Overall, aromatherapy was not effective in reducing nausea severity at greater than three minutes after treatment in comparison to saline, water or controlled breathing placebo (6 studies with 241 participants) but more participants who received aromatherapy were nausea‐free at the end of treatment (4 studies, 193 participants) and fewer participants who received aromatherapy required anti‐nausea medications (7 studies with 609 participants). Peppermint oil did not show an effect on nausea severity at five minutes after treatment (4 studies, 115 participants). We could not pool data for a comparison of isopropyl alcohol to standard anti‐nausea medications for nausea severity. In terms of nausea duration, the time to 50% relief of symptoms was faster with isopropyl alcohol vapour than with standard antiemetics (ondansetron and promethazine) (3 studies, 176 participants). Aromatherapy using isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation provided rapid, short‐term relief of nausea and reduced the need for rescue anti‐nausea drugs (4 studies, 215 participants). Patient satisfaction with aromatherapy appeared high in the four studies that measured this outcome. Fewer participants who received isopropyl alcohol aromatherapy required rescue anti‐nausea drugs compared with those who received saline (4 studies, 291 participants). The participants receiving aromatherapy were not more likely to be free of nausea at the end of the treatment period however they were less likely to require rescue anti‐nausea drugs. All participants in these studies (treatment and comparison groups) reported high levels of satisfaction, possibly indicating that increased attention to the care of postoperative nausea and vomiting improved satisfaction with their care. Aromatherapy may provide a useful therapeutic option, particularly when the alternative is no treatment at all. None of the included studies reported adverse effects from the aromatherapies used. Quality of the evidence Overall the evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, as assessed by GRADE. There was a high risk of bias due to the design of some studies. The included studies consisted of 12 randomized controlled trials and 4 controlled clinical trials where participants were not randomly assigned to a treatment group. In most studies, participants and researchers were aware of group allocation and this may have had an influence on the results. The strong odours involved meant that aromatherapy was a difficult intervention to conceal from participants, research staff and those assessing outcomes. The different comparisons, time points and measurement scales limited the data that could be pooled. Some data were expressed as standardized scales and measures, which enabled pooling of results in meta‐analyses. The data were incomplete for effects longer than 60 minutes.",CD007598
"Background Late‐onset sepsis is associated with increased rates of mortality and morbidity in newborn infants, in addition to poorer long‐term developmental outcomes and increased length of stay and hospital costs. Central line‐associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) is the most common cause of late‐onset sepsis in hospitalised infants, and prevention of CLABSI is a key objective in neonatal care. Increased frequency of CLABSI around the time of removal of central venous catheters (CVCs) has been reported, and use of antibiotics at the time of removal may reduce the incidence and impact of late‐onset sepsis in vulnerable newborn infants. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of giving antibiotics at the time of removal of a central venous catheter (CVC) for reduction of morbidity and mortality in newborn infants, in particular effects on late‐onset sepsis. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group without language restriction to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 6 April 2017), Embase (1980 to 6 April 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 6 April 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials . Selection criteria Randomised, quasi‐randomised, and cluster‐randomised trials considering use of any antibiotic or combination of antibiotics at the time of CVC removal in newborn infants compared with placebo, no antibiotics, or another antibiotic or combination of antibiotics. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Two review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of, and extracted data from the included study. Main results Only one randomised controlled trial was eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Forty‐four of a total of 88 infants received two doses of cephazolin at the time of removal of CVC compared with no antibiotics at the time of removal of CVC in the control group. No infant in the intervention group developed late‐onset sepsis after CVC removal compared with five of 44 (11%) in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 1.60). Cephazolin given at the time of removal of CVC did not statistically significantly alter late‐onset sepsis rates and led to no significant differences in any of the prespecified outcomes. Review authors judged the study to be of low quality because of high risk of bias and imprecision. Authors' conclusions Randomised controlled trials have provided inadequate evidence for assessment of the efficacy or safety of antibiotics given at the time of CVC removal. The single identified trial was underpowered to address this question. Future research should be directed towards targeting use of antibiotics upon removal of CVC for those at greatest risk of complications from CVC removal‐related CLABSI. Researchers should include safety data such as impact upon antibiotic use and resistance patterns. This investigation would best occur as part of a bundle of quality improvement care interventions provided by neonatal networks.","Antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line to reduce complications in newborn infants Review question Does giving antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line reduce death and other serious complications in newborn infants? Background Central lines are specialised catheters that are inserted into a vein so that the tip of the catheter lies in the central veins close to the heart. Central lines are necessary to provide life‐saving medications and nutrition to sick babies. However, their use is sometimes associated with complications, and infection is one of the most common and important of these. It has been noted in some studies that infections occur as central lines are being removed, and it is hypothesised that giving antibiotics as the central line is removed may help prevent infection and associated complications. Study characteristics We found only one small trial of low quality that considered antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line. Key results Researchers found no significant differences in complication rates between babies who were and were not given antibiotics. Conclusion At present, review authors have not found enough evidence to recommend giving antibiotics at the time of removal of a central line to prevent complications in newborn babies.",CD012181
"Background Factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are now recommended in treatment guidelines for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of treatment with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral or systemic embolic events in people with AF. Search methods We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Heart Group (September 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (August 2017), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2017), and Embase (1980 to April 2017). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies, authors and sponsors of relevant published trials. We used outcome data from marketing authorisation applications of apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban that were submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and the USA. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared the effects of long‐term treatment (lasting more than four weeks) with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral and systemic embolism in people with AF. Data collection and analysis The primary efficacy outcome was the composite endpoint of all strokes and systemic embolic events. Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed the quality of the trials and the risk of bias. We calculated a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials using the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by means of a fixed‐effect model. In case of moderate or high heterogeneity of treatment effects, we used a random‐effects model to compare the overall treatment effects. We also performed a pre‐specified sensitivity analysis excluding any open‐label studies. Main results We included data from 67,688 participants randomised into 13 RCTs. The included trials directly compared dose‐adjusted warfarin with either apixaban, betrixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux, or rivaroxaban. The majority of the included data (approximately 90%) was from apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The composite primary efficacy endpoint of all strokes (both ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and non‐central nervous systemic embolic events was reported in all of the included studies. Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly decreased the number of strokes and systemic embolic events compared with dose‐adjusted warfarin in participants with AF (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; 13 studies; 67,477 participants; high‐quality evidence). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of major bleedings compared with warfarin (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84; 13 studies; 67,396 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There was, however, statistically significant and high heterogeneity (I 2  = 83%). When we repeated this analysis using a random‐effects model, it did not show a statistically significant decrease in the number of major bleedings (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17). A pre‐specified sensitivity analysis excluding all open‐label studies showed that treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of major bleedings compared with warfarin (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81), but high heterogeneity was also observed in this analysis (I 2  = 72%). The same sensitivity analysis using a random‐effects model also showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of major bleedings in participants treated with factor Xa inhibitors (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the risk of intracranial haemorrhages (ICHs) compared with warfarin (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 12 studies; 66,259 participants; high‐quality evidence). We observed moderate, but statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2  = 55%). The pre‐specified sensitivity analysis excluding open‐label studies showed that treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of ICHs compared with warfarin (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.56), with low, non‐statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2  = 27%). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor also significantly reduced the number of all‐cause deaths compared with warfarin (OR 0.89, 95% 0.83 to 0.95; 10 studies; 65,624 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Treatment with factor Xa inhibitors significantly reduced the number of strokes and systemic embolic events compared with warfarin in people with AF. The absolute effect of factor Xa inhibitors compared with warfarin treatment was, however, rather small. Factor Xa inhibitors also reduced the number of ICHs, all‐cause deaths and major bleedings compared with warfarin, although the evidence for a reduction in the latter is less robust.","Comparing two types of blood‐thinning drugs, factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists, to prevent blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation Review question We compared the benefits and harms of two types of so‐called ""blood‐thinning"" drugs (factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists) in people with atrial fibrillation. Background People with atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes the heart to beat irregularly, are at an increased risk of getting blood clots. Such clots can block blood vessels and cause severe organ damage in the brain (stroke) or other organs. Various guidelines recommend that people with atrial fibrillation should be treated with ""blood‐thinning"" drugs such as factor Xa inhibitors or vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) because these drugs can prevent the formation of blood clots. Serious side effects of these drugs are bleedings (e.g. into the brain) that can cause serious disability or even death. Study characteristics We searched various sources up to 29 August 2017 and included 13 studies that involved 67,688 people with atrial fibrillation who received either a factor Xa inhibitor or a vitamin K antagonist. All included people were adults and on average aged between 65 and 74 years. Approximately one‐third were women. Key results We found that factor Xa inhibitors when compared with warfarin, which was used as comparator in all trials, reduced the number of strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. This reduction was, however, rather small. Factor Xa inhibitors also appeared to reduce the number of serious bleedings (including those into the brain) and the number of people dying from any cause compared with warfarin. Quality of evidence We considered the quality of evidence in our review as moderate to high. The studies that we included were generally large to very large. We found that the results from the larger studies were generally similar and this strengthened our findings. Finally, we are confident that we included all relevant studies in our review and did not miss any important studies.",CD008980
"Background Every day children and adults die from acute community‐acquired bacterial meningitis, particularly in low‐income countries, and survivors risk deafness, epilepsy and neurological disabilities. Osmotic therapies may attract extra‐vascular fluid and reduce cerebral oedema, and thus reduce death and improve neurological outcomes. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013. Objectives To evaluate the effects of osmotic therapies added to antibiotics for acute bacterial meningitis in children and adults on mortality, deafness and neurological disability. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to 17 February 2017), Embase (1974 to 17 February 2017), CINAHL (1981 to 17 February 2017), LILACS (1982 to 17 February 2017) and registers of ongoing clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.com, WHO ICTRP) (21 February 2017). We also searched conference abstracts and contacted researchers in the field (up to 12 December 2015). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials testing any osmotic therapy in adults or children with acute bacterial meningitis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results and selected trials for inclusion. Results are presented using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and grouped according to whether the participants received steroids or not. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included five trials with 1451 participants. Four trials evaluated glycerol against placebo, and one evaluated glycerol against 50% dextrose; in addition three trials evaluated dexamethasone and one trial evaluated acetaminophen (paracetamol) in a factorial design. Stratified analysis shows no effect modification with steroids; we present aggregate effect estimates. Compared to placebo, glycerol probably has little or no effect on death in people with bacterial meningitis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.30; 5 studies, 1272 participants;  moderate‐certainty evidence ), but may reduce neurological disability (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00; 5 studies, 1270 participants;  low‐certainty evidence ). Glycerol may have little or no effect on seizures during treatment for meningitis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.30; 4 studies, 1090 participants;  low‐certainty evidence ). Glycerol may reduce the risk of subsequent deafness (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.93; 5 studies, 922 participants;  low to moderate‐certainty evidence ). Glycerol probably has little or no effect on gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.19; 3 studies, 607 participants;  moderate‐certainty evidence ). The evidence on nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea is uncertain (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.47; 2 studies, 851 participants;  very low‐certainty evidence ). Authors' conclusions Glycerol was the only osmotic therapy evaluated, and data from trials to date have not demonstrated an effect on death. Glycerol may reduce neurological deficiency and deafness.","Osmotic therapies added to antibiotics for acute bacterial meningitis What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review is to collect and analyse trials evaluating osmotic therapies given orally or intravenously to people with acute bacterial meningitis. Cochrane authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question; they found five relevant studies. Key messages Giving glycerol, an osmotic diuretic, probably has little or no effect on death ( moderate‐certainty evidence ), but may reduce subsequent deafness ( moderate‐certainty evidence)  or neurological disability ( low‐certainty evidence ). The evidence is current to 17 February 2017. What was studied in the review? In meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord is infected, usually as a result of spread from the blood. Any form of meningitis can result in death or severe disability, but acute bacterial meningitis is rapidly fatal without treatment. Even with antibiotics, 10% to 15% of children with bacterial meningitis die in high‐income countries with much higher rates in low‐income settings. The infection causes the brain to swell, and this is thought to contribute to death and to long‐term brain damage in survivors. Osmotic therapies increase the concentration of the blood by exerting an osmotic pressure across a semi‐permeable membrane (such as a cell wall or blood vessel lining in the brain). This draws water from the brain into the blood, thereby reducing pressure in the brain. Potentially osmotic therapies could increase the rate of survival, or they could do harm. What are the main results of the review? We included five trials that compared glycerol with placebo in a total of 1451 patients with bacterial meningitis. In the studies steroids were often given as well, but this did not appear to modify any of the effects seen with glycerol. This review detected no benefit from glycerol relating to death. There appeared to be marginal protection against deafness and against neurological disability. No effect on epileptic seizures at follow‐up was noted. Glycerol was not associated with any severe adverse effects. The number of trials included was small and only two tested a large number of participants. All trials were from different healthcare settings and examined either adults or children.",CD008806
"Background Construction workers are frequently exposed to various types of injury‐inducing hazards. There are a number of injury prevention interventions, yet their effectiveness is uncertain. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for preventing injuries in construction workers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL (issue 3), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO up to April 2017. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. We also handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, controlled before‐after (CBA) studies and interrupted time‐series (ITS) of all types of interventions for preventing fatal and non‐fatal injuries among workers at construction sites. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed their risk of bias. For ITS studies, we re‐analysed the studies and used an initial effect, measured as the change in injury rate in the year after the intervention, as well as a sustained effect, measured as the change in time trend before and after the intervention. Main results Seventeen studies (14 ITS and 3 CBA studies) met the inclusion criteria in this updated version of the review. The ITS studies evaluated the effects of: introducing or changing regulations that laid down safety and health requirements for the construction sites (nine studies), a safety campaign (two studies), a drug‐free workplace programme (one study), a training programme (one study), and safety inspections (one study) on fatal and non‐fatal occupational injuries. One CBA study evaluated the introduction of occupational health services such as risk assessment and health surveillance, one evaluated a training programme and one evaluated the effect of a subsidy for upgrading to safer scaffoldings. The overall risk of bias of most of the included studies was high, as it was uncertain for the ITS studies whether the intervention was independent from other changes and thus could be regarded as the main reason of change in the outcome. Therefore, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all comparisons. Compulsory interventions Regulatory interventions at national or branch level may or may not have an initial effect (effect size (ES) of −0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.08 to 1.41) and may or may not have a sustained effect (ES −0.03; 95% CI −0.30 to 0.24) on fatal and non‐fatal injuries (9 ITS studies) due to highly inconsistent results (I² = 98%). Inspections may or may not have an effect on non‐fatal injuries (ES 0.07; 95% CI −2.83 to 2.97; 1 ITS study). Educational interventions Safety training interventions may result in no significant reduction of non‐fatal injuries (1 ITS study and 1 CBA study). Informational interventions We found no studies that had evaluated informational interventions alone such as campaigns for risk communication. Persuasive interventions We found no studies that had evaluated persuasive interventions alone such as peer feedback on workplace actions to increase acceptance of safe working methods. Facilitative interventions Monetary subsidies to companies may lead to a greater decrease in non‐fatal injuries from falls to a lower level than no subsidies (risk ratio (RR) at follow‐up: 0.93; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.91 from RR 3.89 at baseline; 1 CBA study). Multifaceted interventions A safety campaign intervention may result in an initial (ES −1.82; 95% CI −2.90 to −0.74) and sustained (ES −1.30; 95% CI −1.79 to −0.81) decrease in injuries at the company level (1 ITS study), but not at the regional level (1 ITS study). A multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level may reduce non‐fatal injuries in the year following implementation by −7.6 per 100 person‐years (95% CI −11.2 to −4.0) and in the years thereafter by −2.0 per 100 person‐years (95% CI −3.5 to −0.5) (1 ITS study). Introducing occupational health services may result in no decrease in fatal or non‐fatal injuries (one CBA study). Authors' conclusions The vast majority of interventions to adopt safety measures recommended by standard texts on safety, consultants and safety courses have not been adequately evaluated. There is very low‐quality evidence that introducing regulations as such may or may not result in a decrease in fatal and non‐fatal injuries. There is also very low‐quality evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections or the introduction of occupational health services may not reduce non‐fatal injuries in construction companies. There is very low‐quality evidence that company‐oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign, a multifaceted drug workplace programme and subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings may reduce non‐fatal injuries among construction workers. More studies, preferably cluster‐randomised controlled trials, are needed to evaluate different strategies to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures prescribed by regulation.","Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers Occupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. What is the aim of this review? To find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. Key messages We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. What was studied in the review? We looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. What are the main results of the review? Introducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. Additional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.",CD006251
"Background The 8‐aminoquinoline (8AQ) drugs act on  Plasmodium falciparum  gametocytes, which transmit malaria from infected people to mosquitoes. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg primaquine (PQ) be added to malaria treatment schedules in low‐transmission areas or those with artemisinin resistance. This replaced the previous recommendation of 0.75 mg/kg, aiming to reduce haemolysis risk in people with glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, common in people living in malarious areas. Whether this approach, and at this dose, is effective in reducing transmission is not clear. Objectives To assess the effects of single dose or short‐course PQ (or an alternative 8AQ) alongside treatment for people with  P. falciparum  malaria. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICRTP) portal using ‘malaria*', ‘falciparum', ‘primaquine', ‘8‐aminoquinoline', and eight 8AQ drug names as search terms. We checked reference lists of included trials, and contacted researchers and organizations. Date of last search: 21 July 2017. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs in children or adults, adding PQ (or alternative 8AQ) as a single dose or short course alongside treatment for  P. falciparum  malaria. Data collection and analysis Two authors screened abstracts, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We sought evidence on transmission (community incidence), infectiousness (people infectious and mosquitoes infected), and potential infectiousness (gametocyte measures assessed by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). We grouped trials into artemisinin and non‐artemisinin treatments, and stratified by PQ dose (low, 0.2 to 0.25 mg/kg; moderate, 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg; high, 0.75 mg/kg). We used GRADE, and absolute effects of infectiousness using trial control groups. Main results We included 24 RCTs and one quasi‐RCT, comprising 43 arms. Fourteen trials evaluated artemisinin treatments (23 arms), nine trials evaluated non‐artemisinin treatments (13 arms), and two trials included both artemisinin and non‐artemisinin arms (three and two arms, respectively). Two trial arms used bulaquine. Seven PQ arms used low dose (six with artemisinin), 11 arms used moderate dose (seven with artemisinin), and the remaining arms used high dose. Fifteen trials tested for G6PD status: 11 excluded participants with G6PD deficiency, one included only those with G6PD deficiency, and three included all, irrespective of status. The remaining 10 trials either did not test or did not report on testing. No cluster trials evaluating community effects on malaria transmission met the inclusion criteria. With artemisinin treatment Low dose PQ Infectiousness (participants infectious to mosquitoes) was reduced (day 3 or 4: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.88, 3 trials, 105 participants; day 8: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.58, 4 trials, 243 participants;  low certainty evidence ). This translates to a reduction in percentage of people infectious on day 3 or 4 from 14% to 2%, and, for day 8, from 4% to 1%; the waning infectiousness in the control group by day 8 making the absolute effect smaller by day 8. For gametocytes detected by PCR, there was little or no effect of PQ at day 3 or 4 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; 3 trials, 414 participants;  moderate certainty evidence ); with reduction at day 8 (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.65; 4 trials, 532 participants;  high certainty evidence).  Severe haemolysis was infrequent, with or without PQ, in these groups with few G6PD‐deficient individuals (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.39; 4 trials, 752 participants,  moderate certainty evidence) . Moderate dose PQ Infectiousness was reduced (day 3 or 4: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.94; 3 trials, 109 participants; day 8 RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57; 4 trials, 246 participants;  low certainty evidence ). Illustrative risk estimates for moderate dose were the same as low dose. The pattern and level of certainty of evidence with gametocytes detected by PCR was the same as low dose, and severe haemolysis was infrequent in both groups. High dose PQ Infectiousness was reduced (day 4: RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.68, 1 trial, 101 participants; day 8: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.41, 2 trials, 181 participants,  low certainty evidence ). The effects on gametocyte prevalence showed a similar pattern to moderate and low dose PQ. Trials did not systematically report evidence of haemolysis. With non‐artemisinin treatment Trials with non‐artemisinin treatment have been conducted only for moderate and high dose PQ. With high dose, infectiousness appeared markedly reduced on day 5 (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; 30 participants,  very low certainty evidence ), with similar reductions at day 8. For both moderate dose (two trials with 221 people) and high dose (two trials with 30 people), reduction in gametocytes (detected by microscopy) showed similar patterns as for artemisinin treatments, with little or no effect at day 4 or 5, and larger effects by day 8. No trials with non‐artemisinin partner drugs systematically sought evidence of severe haemolysis. Two trials comparing bulaquine with PQ suggest bulaquine may have larger effects on gametocytes by microscopy on day 8 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66; 2 trials, 112 participants). Authors' conclusions A single low dose of PQ (0.25 mg/kg) added to artemisinin‐based combination therapy for malaria reduces infectiousness of people to mosquitoes at day 3‐4 and day 8, and appears as effective as higher doses. The absolute effect is greater at day 3 or 4, and smaller at day 8, in part because of the lower infectiousness in the control group. There was no evidence of increased haemolysis at 0.25 mg/kg, but few G6PD‐deficient individuals were included in the trials. The effect on infectiousness precedes the effect of PQ on gametocyte prevalence. We do not know whether single dose PQ could reduce malaria transmission at community level. 12 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (21 Jul, 2017) were included and eight ongoing studies have been identified (see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' section)","A single dose of primaquine added to malaria treatment to prevent malaria transmission What is the aim of this review? To assess the effects of adding a single dose of primaquine (PQ) to treatment for falciparum malaria to reduce disease transmission. This Cochrane Review update includes 25 controlled trials. The date of latest search was 21 July 2017. Key messages A single low dose of PQ, at 0.25 mg/kg, which the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends adding to artemisinin‐based combination therapy for malaria, reduces infectiousness (transmission from people to mosquitoes). In the trials, the percentage of people who infected mosquitoes three to four days after treatment was reduced from 14% to 2%, with a smaller effect at day 8, from 4% to 1%, with no evidence of harm. What was studied in the review PQ kills gametocytes (malaria transmission stages) of the falciparum malaria parasite. Gametocytes infect mosquitoes during a bite, thus perpetuating transmission. There is concern that PQ may cause red blood cells to burst (haemolysis) in people with glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a genetically‐determined condition common in many malaria‐endemic settings, which can lead to anaemia. Recognizing concerns about the risk of haemolysis, the WHO reduced the recommended PQ dose from 0.75 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg in 2012. Ideally, this approach would be tested by randomly assigning villages to standard malaria treatment, or standard treatment plus a low dose of PQ, then measuring the effect on malaria over time but this would be difficult and expensive. So, indirect indicators are used to shed light on effectiveness, including feeding studies, in which mosquitoes are allowed to feed on people (or their blood), comparing those who were assigned PQ with those who were not. Alternatively, researchers may simply monitor the presence (prevalence), number (density), and duration (time of persistence) of gametocytes in the blood of people after different treatments, assuming that gametocytes are viable irrespective of exposure to PQ. What the research says The 25 included trials span several decades and include a variety of treatments and PQ doses. Related to safety assessment, some trials tested participants for G6PD activity. Other trials reported results based on their G6PD status, others did not test (or did not say whether they did), and others tested and excluded people with G6PD deficiency. There were no ideal community‐level studies that would answer the question directly. Five feeding trials with multiple arms included three low‐dose, three medium‐dose, and two high‐dose comparisons, showing a markedly reduced proportion of people infectious who received PQ in trials with any events. Two trials using older malaria treatments and high dose PQ had similar results. The other trials focused on indirect measures of potential infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes. In these trials, PQ shortened the period of potential infectiousness, with a lower prevalence and density of gametocytes up to day 8 after treatment. The effect was similar at all PQ dose levels. Few serious haemolytic events occurred in these trials, but PQ did affect non‐serious haemoglobin measures, even at low doses. What are the main results of the review? A single low dose of PQ added to an artemisinin regimen for malaria reduces infectiousness to mosquitoes and is relatively safe for most people. PQ at WHO‐recommended dose reduces infectiousness to mosquitoes on day 3‐4 and day 8 with no evidence of harm. It is unclear whether this reduction would materially reduce malaria transmission in communities.",CD008152
"Background The consequences of influenza in adults are mainly time off work. Vaccination of pregnant women is recommended internationally. This is an update of a review published in 2014. Future updates of this review will be made only when new trials or vaccines become available. Observational data included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated due to their lack of influence on the review conclusions. Objectives To assess the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and harm) of vaccines against influenza in healthy adults, including pregnant women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 31 December 2016), Embase (1990 to 31 December 2016), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; 1 July 2017), and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 July 2017), as well as checking the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing influenza vaccines with placebo or no intervention in naturally occurring influenza in healthy individuals aged 16 to 65 years. Previous versions of this review included observational comparative studies assessing serious and rare harms cohort and case‐control studies. Due to the uncertain quality of observational (i.e. non‐randomised) studies and their lack of influence on the review conclusions, we decided to update only randomised evidence. The searches for observational comparative studies are no longer updated. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We rated certainty of evidence for key outcomes (influenza, influenza‐like illness (ILI), hospitalisation, and adverse effects) using GRADE. Main results We included 52 clinical trials of over 80,000 people assessing the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. We have presented findings from 25 studies comparing inactivated parenteral influenza vaccine against placebo or do‐nothing control groups as the most relevant to decision‐making. The studies were conducted over single influenza seasons in North America, South America, and Europe between 1969 and 2009. We did not consider studies at high risk of bias to influence the results of our outcomes except for hospitalisation. Inactivated influenza vaccines probably reduce influenza in healthy adults from 2.3% without vaccination to 0.9% (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.47; 71,221 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and they probably reduce ILI from 21.5% to 18.1% (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 25,795 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; 71 healthy adults need to be vaccinated to prevent one of them experiencing influenza, and 29 healthy adults need to be vaccinated to prevent one of them experiencing an ILI). The difference between the two number needed to vaccinate (NNV) values depends on the different incidence of ILI and confirmed influenza among the study populations. Vaccination may lead to a small reduction in the risk of hospitalisation in healthy adults, from 14.7% to 14.1%, but the CI is wide and does not rule out a large benefit (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08; 11,924 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Vaccines may lead to little or no small reduction in days off work (‐0.04 days, 95% CI ‐0.14 days to 0.06; low‐certainty evidence). Inactivated vaccines cause an increase in fever from 1.5% to 2.3%. We identified one RCT and one controlled clinical trial assessing the effects of vaccination in pregnant women. The efficacy of inactivated vaccine containing pH1N1 against influenza was 50% (95% CI 14% to 71%) in mothers (NNV 55), and 49% (95% CI 12% to 70%) in infants up to 24 weeks (NNV 56). No data were available on efficacy against seasonal influenza during pregnancy. Evidence from observational studies showed effectiveness of influenza vaccines against ILI in pregnant women to be 24% (95% CI 11% to 36%, NNV 94), and against influenza in newborns from vaccinated women to be 41% (95% CI 6% to 63%, NNV 27). Live aerosol vaccines have an overall effectiveness corresponding to an NNV of 46. The performance of one‐ or two‐dose whole‐virion 1968 to 1969 pandemic vaccines was higher (NNV 16) against ILI and (NNV 35) against influenza. There was limited impact on hospitalisations in the 1968 to 1969 pandemic (NNV 94). The administration of both seasonal and 2009 pandemic vaccines during pregnancy had no significant effect on abortion or neonatal death, but this was based on observational data sets. Authors' conclusions Healthy adults who receive inactivated parenteral influenza vaccine rather than no vaccine probably experience less influenza, from just over 2% to just under 1% (moderate‐certainty evidence). They also probably experience less ILI following vaccination, but the degree of benefit when expressed in absolute terms varied across different settings. Variation in protection against ILI may be due in part to inconsistent symptom classification. Certainty of evidence for the small reductions in hospitalisations and time off work is low. Protection against influenza and ILI in mothers and newborns was smaller than the effects seen in other populations considered in this review. Vaccines increase the risk of a number of adverse events, including a small increase in fever, but rates of nausea and vomiting are uncertain. The protective effect of vaccination in pregnant women and newborns is also very modest. We did not find any evidence of an association between influenza vaccination and serious adverse events in the comparative studies considered in this review. Fifteen included RCTs were industry funded (29%).","Vaccines to prevent influenza in healthy adults Review aim The aim of this Cochrane Review, first published in 1999, was to summarise research that looks at the effects of immunising healthy adults with influenza vaccines during influenza seasons. We used information from randomised trials comparing vaccines with dummy vaccines or nothing. We focused on the results of studies looking at vaccines based on inactivated influenza viruses, which are developed by killing the influenza virus with a chemical and are given by injection through the skin. We evaluated the effects of vaccines on reducing the number of adults with confirmed influenza and the number of adults who had influenza‐like symptoms such as headache, high temperature, cough, and muscle pain (influenza‐like illness, or ILI). We also evaluated hospital admission and harms arising from the vaccines. Observational data included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated due to their lack of influence on the review conclusions. What was studied in this review? Over 200 viruses cause ILI, which produces the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough, and runny nose) as influenza. Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between ILI and influenza because both last for days and rarely cause serious illness or death. The types of virus contained in influenza vaccines are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following influenza seasons, according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine). Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible of the pandemic (i.e. the type A H1N1 for the 2009 to 2010 pandemic). Main results We found 52 clinical trials of over 80,000 adults. We were unable to determine the impact of bias on about 70% of the included studies due to insufficient reporting of details. Around 15% of the included studies were well designed and conducted. We focused on reporting of results from 25 studies that looked at inactivated vaccines. Injected influenza vaccines probably have a small protective effect against influenza and ILI (moderate‐certainty evidence), as 71 people would need to be vaccinated to avoid one influenza case, and 29 would need to be vaccinated to avoid one case of ILI. Vaccination may have little or no appreciable effect on hospitalisations (low‐certainty evidence) or number of working days lost. We were uncertain of the protection provided to pregnant women against ILI and influenza by the inactivated influenza vaccine, or this was at least very limited. The administration of seasonal vaccines during pregnancy showed no significant effect on abortion or neonatal death, but the evidence set was observational. Key messages Inactivated vaccines can reduce the proportion of healthy adults (including pregnant women) who have influenza and ILI, but their impact is modest. We are uncertain about the effects of inactivated vaccines on working days lost or serious complications of influenza during influenza season. How up to date is this review? The evidence is current to 31 December 2016.",CD001269
"Background Airway oedema (swelling) and mucus plugging are the principal pathological features in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis. Nebulised hypertonic saline solution (≥ 3%) may reduce these pathological changes and decrease airway obstruction. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2010 and 2013. Objectives To assess the effects of nebulised hypertonic (≥ 3%) saline solution in infants with acute bronchiolitis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science on 11 August 2017. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 8 April 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials using nebulised hypertonic saline alone or in conjunction with bronchodilators as an active intervention and nebulised 0.9% saline, or standard treatment as a comparator in children under 24 months with acute bronchiolitis. The primary outcome for inpatient trials was length of hospital stay, and the primary outcome for outpatients or emergency department trials was rate of hospitalisation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias in included studies. We conducted random‐effects model meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We used mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect size metrics. Main results We identified 26 new trials in this update, of which 9 await classification due to insufficient data for eligibility assessment, and 17 trials (N = 3105) met the inclusion criteria. We included a total of 28 trials involving 4195 infants with acute bronchiolitis, of whom 2222 infants received hypertonic saline. Hospitalised infants treated with nebulised hypertonic saline had a statistically significant shorter mean length of hospital stay compared to those treated with nebulised 0.9% saline (MD ‐0.41 days, 95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.07; P = 0.02, I² = 79%; 17 trials; 1867 infants) (GRADE quality of evidence: low). Infants who received hypertonic saline also had statistically significant lower post‐inhalation clinical scores than infants who received 0.9% saline in the first three days of treatment (day 1: MD ‐0.77, 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.36, P < 0.001; day 2: MD ‐1.28, 95% CI ‐1.91 to ‐0.65, P < 0.001; day 3: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐1.82 to ‐1.04, P < 0.001) (GRADE quality of evidence: low). Nebulised hypertonic saline reduced the risk of hospitalisation by 14% compared with nebulised 0.9% saline among infants who were outpatients and those treated in the emergency department (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98; P = 0.02, I² = 7%; 8 trials; 1723 infants) (GRADE quality of evidence: moderate). Twenty‐four trials presented safety data: 13 trials (1363 infants, 703 treated with hypertonic saline) did not report any adverse events, and 11 trials (2360 infants, 1265 treated with hypertonic saline) reported at least one adverse event, most of which were mild and resolved spontaneously. Authors' conclusions Nebulised hypertonic saline may modestly reduce length of stay among infants hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis and improve clinical severity score. Treatment with nebulised hypertonic saline may also reduce the risk of hospitalisation among outpatients and emergency department patients. However, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low to moderate.","Is hypertonic saline solution via nebuliser effective and safe for infants with acute bronchiolitis? Review question Is hypertonic saline solution via nebuliser effective and safe for the treatment of infants with acute bronchiolitis, compared to normal saline solution? Background Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in children aged up to two years. Bronchiolitis occurs when small structures (bronchioles) leading to the lungs become infected, causing inflammation, swelling, and mucus production. This makes breathing difficult, especially in very young children, who develop coughs and wheezing. Because bronchiolitis is usually caused by a virus, drug treatment is usually not effective. Hypertonic saline (sterile salt water solution) breathed in as a fine mist using a nebuliser may help relieve wheezing and breathing difficulty. We compared nebulised hypertonic (≥ 3%) saline solution with nebulised normal (0.9%) saline for infants with acute bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review previously published in 2008, 2010, and 2013. Search date 11 August 2017 Study characteristics We identified 26 new studies in this update, of which 9 await assessment and 17 trials (N = 3105) were added. We included a total of 28 trials involving 4195 infants with acute bronchiolitis. Key results Nebulised hypertonic saline may reduce hospital stay by 10 hours in comparison to normal saline for infants admitted with acute bronchiolitis. We found that 'clinical severity scores', which are used by doctors to assess patient health, for children treated as outpatients or in hospital improved when administered nebulised hypertonic saline compared to normal saline. Nebulised hypertonic saline may also reduce the risk of hospitalisation by 14% among children treated as outpatients or in the emergency department. We found only minor and spontaneously resolved adverse effects from the use of nebulised hypertonic saline when given with treatment to relax airways (bronchodilators). Reductions in hospital stay were smaller than previously thought. However, an average reduction of 10 hours in the length of hospital stay for infants is significant because bronchiolitis usually has a short duration. Nebulised hypertonic saline appears to be safe and widely available at low cost. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was low to moderate: there were inconsistencies in results among trials and risk of bias in some trials. Future large trials are therefore needed to confirm the benefits of nebulised hypertonic saline for children with bronchiolitis treated as outpatients and in hospital.",CD006458
"Background Epilepsy is a common neurological condition with a worldwide prevalence of around 1%. Approximately 60% to 70% of people with epilepsy will achieve a longer‐term remission from seizures, and most achieve that remission shortly after starting antiepileptic drug treatment. Most people with epilepsy are treated with a single antiepileptic drug (monotherapy) and current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first‐line treatment for partial onset seizures and sodium valproate for generalised onset seizures; however a range of other antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments are available, and evidence is needed regarding their comparative effectiveness in order to inform treatment choices. Objectives To compare the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, remission and first seizure of 10 AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide) currently used as monotherapy in children and adults with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalised) or generalised tonic‐clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types (absence, myoclonus). Search methods We searched the following databases: Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and SCOPUS, and two clinical trials registers. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field. The date of the most recent search was 27 July 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of a monotherapy design in adults or children with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). Data collection and analysis This was an individual participant data (IPD) review and network meta‐analysis. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12‐month remission', 'time to achieve six‐month remission', 'time to first seizure post‐randomisation', and 'occurrence of adverse events'. We presented all time‐to‐event outcomes as Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed pairwise meta‐analysis of head‐to‐head comparisons between drugs within trials to obtain 'direct' treatment effect estimates and we performed frequentist network meta‐analysis to combine direct evidence with indirect evidence across the treatment network of 10 drugs. We investigated inconsistency between direct estimates and network meta‐analysis via node splitting. Due to variability in methods and detail of reporting adverse events, we have not performed an analysis. We have provided a narrative summary of the most commonly reported adverse events. Main results IPD was provided for at least one outcome of this review for 12,391 out of a total of 17,961 eligible participants (69% of total data) from 36 out of the 77 eligible trials (47% of total trials). We could not include IPD from the remaining 41 trials in analysis for a variety of reasons, such as being unable to contact an author or sponsor to request data, data being lost or no longer available, cost and resources required to prepare data being prohibitive, or local authority or country‐specific restrictions. We were able to calculate direct treatment effect estimates for between half and two thirds of comparisons across the outcomes of the review, however for many of the comparisons, data were contributed by only a single trial or by a small number of participants, so confidence intervals of estimates were wide. Network meta‐analysis showed that for the primary outcome ‘Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment,’ for individuals with partial seizures; levetiracetam performed (statistically) significantly better than current first‐line treatment carbamazepine and other current first‐line treatment lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam); carbamazepine performed significantly better than gabapentin and phenobarbitone (high‐quality evidence). For individuals with generalised onset seizures, first‐line treatment sodium valproate performed significantly better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbitone (moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). Furthermore, for both partial and generalised onset seizures, the earliest licenced treatment, phenobarbitone seems to perform worse than all other treatments (moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). Network meta‐analysis also showed that for secondary outcomes ‘Time to 12‐month remission of seizures’ and ‘Time to six‐month remission of seizures,’ few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalised seizure types (moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). For secondary outcome ‘Time to first seizure,’ for individuals with partial seizures; phenobarbitone performed significantly better than both current first‐line treatments carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed significantly better than sodium valproate, gabapentin and lamotrigine. Phenytoin also performed significantly better than lamotrigine (high‐quality evidence). In general, the earliest licenced treatments (phenytoin and phenobarbitone) performed better than the other treatments for both seizure types (moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). Generally, direct evidence and network meta‐analysis estimates (direct plus indirect evidence) were numerically similar and consistent with confidence intervals of effect sizes overlapping. The most commonly reported adverse events across all drugs were drowsiness/fatigue, headache or migraine, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness/faintness and rash or skin disorders. Authors' conclusions Overall, the high‐quality evidence provided by this review supports current guidance (e.g. NICE) that carbamazepine and lamotrigine are suitable first‐line treatments for individuals with partial onset seizures and also demonstrates that levetiracetam may be a suitable alternative. High‐quality evidence from this review also supports the use of sodium valproate as the first‐line treatment for individuals with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types) and also demonstrates that lamotrigine and levetiracetam would be suitable alternatives to either of these first‐line treatments, particularly for those of childbearing potential, for whom sodium valproate may not be an appropriate treatment option due to teratogenicity.","Antiepileptic drug monotherapy (single drug treatment) for epilepsy Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: partial seizures that start in one area of the brain, and generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures that start in both cerebral hemispheres simultaneously. For around 70% of people with epilepsy seizures can be controlled, and for the majority, seizures are controlled with a single antiepileptic drug. Currently in the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as the first treatment options to try for individuals with newly diagnosed partial seizures and sodium valproate for individuals with newly diagnosed generalised tonic‐clonic seizures; however a range of other antiepileptic drug treatments are available. The choice of the first antiepileptic drug for an individual with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance and should be made taking into account high‐quality evidence of how effective the drugs are at controlling seizures and whether they are associated with side effects. It is also important that drugs appropriate for different seizure types are compared to each other. Review methods The antiepileptic drugs of interest to this review were carbamazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide. In this review, we evaluated the evidence from 77 randomised controlled clinical trials comparing two or more of the drugs of interest based on how effective the drugs were at controlling seizures (i.e. whether people had recurrence of seizures or had long periods of freedom from seizures (remission)) and how tolerable any related side effects of the drugs were. We were able to combine data for 12,391 people from 36 of the 77 trials; for the remaining 5570 people from 41 trials, data were not available to use in this review. We performed two types of analysis in this review; firstly we combined data available where pairs of drugs had been compared directly in clinical trials and secondly we performed an analysis to combine all information from the clinical trials across the 'network' of 10 drugs. This analysis allowed us to compare drugs in the network that had not previously been compared to each other in clinical trials. Key results Out of the 45 possible pairwise comparisons of the 10 drugs of interest in the review, data from clinical trials were available for just over half of these comparisons but for many only a single trial had made a comparison of the two drugs and the comparison did not include many people. Our 'network' analysis showed that the oldest drugs in the network (phenobarbitone and phenytoin) were better options in terms of seizure control than the other drugs but that these older drugs were the worst in terms of long‐term retention (withdrawing from the treatment) compared to the newer drugs such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam. The most commonly reported side effects across all drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, headache or migraine, gastrointestinal disturbances (stomach upsets), dizziness or faintness and rash or skin disorders. Quality of the evidence This review provides high‐quality evidence for individuals with partial seizures and moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence for individuals with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures, as less information is available for some of the drugs of interest for people with this seizure type. Conclusions The results of this review support the NICE guidelines that carbamazepine and lamotrigine are suitable first treatment options for individuals with partial onset seizures and also show that levetiracetam would also be a suitable treatment. Results of this review also support the use of sodium valproate as the first‐line treatment for individuals with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures and also show that lamotrigine and levetiracetam would be suitable alternatives, particularly for those who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant, for whom sodium valproate may not be an appropriate treatment option.

"Background Patellofemoral pain syndrome, now generally referred to as patellofemoral pain (PFP), is one of the most common orthopaedic disorders, characterised by pain in the anterior or retropatellar knee region. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been proposed generally as a complementary treatment, associated with other interventions such as exercise, or as a single treatment to increase muscle force, reduce knee pain, and improve function. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of neuromuscular electrical stimulation for people with patellofemoral pain. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, LILACS, trial registers, conference abstracts, and reference lists. We carried out the search in May 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of NMES for people with PFP. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the process of study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment in duplicate. The primary outcomes were knee pain, knee function, and adverse events. The timing of outcome measurements was up to three months (short term), three to 12 months (medium term), and 12 months and above from trial entry (long term). We calculated risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences or standardised mean differences for continuous data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed‐effect model. Main results We included eight randomised clinical trials, reporting results for 345 participants with PFP. The mean ages of trial populations ranged from 25 to 43 years, and the majority (53% to 100%) of participants were female. There was a wide duration of symptoms, with the minimum duration of symptoms for trial inclusion ranging from one to six months. In addition to the study inclusion criteria, studies varied widely in the characteristics of the NMES and its application, and associated co‐interventions. We assessed all trials as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, particularly blinding and incomplete outcome data. The results of a laboratory‐based trial reporting knee pain immediately after a single 15‐minute session of NMES are not reported here as these are of questionable clinical relevance. The seven remaining trials provided evidence for three comparisons. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence, using GRADE, for all primary outcomes for all comparisons as very low, thus we are very unsure of the findings. Four studies compared NMES plus exercise versus exercise alone. Patellar taping was applied as well as exercise to all participants of one study, and patellar taping and ice were also applied in another study. Each trial tested a different multiple‐session NMES programme. Pooled data from three studies (118 participants) provided very low‐quality evidence that NMES is associated with reduced pain at the end of treatment (ranging from 3 to 12 weeks): mean difference ‐1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.23 to ‐1.02; visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 10; higher scores = worse pain. However, this result may not be clinically relevant since the minimal clinically important difference for VAS during activities (1.5 to 2.0, out of 10 points) lies within the 95% CI. We found very low‐quality evidence from pooled data from two trials of little effect of NMES on knee function, as measured by two knee function rating systems. We found inconclusive and very low‐quality evidence from one trial (29 participants) of little effect of NMES on pain and function at one‐year follow‐up. None of the four trials reported on adverse effects of treatment. One study (94 participants) compared NMES, applied four hours per day on a daily basis for four weeks, with two types of exercises (isometric and isokinetic). The study did not report on knee pain or adverse events. The study provided very low‐quality evidence of no important difference between the two groups in knee function at the end of the four‐week treatment. Of note is the potentially onerous NMES schedule in this study, which does not correspond to that typically used in clinical practice. Two studies compared different types of NMES. Simultaneously delivered high‐low frequencies NMES was compared with sequentially delivered high‐low frequencies NMES in one trial (14 participants) and with fixed frequency NMES in the second trial (64 participants). The studies provided very low‐quality evidence of no important differences at the end of the six‐week treatment programme between the simultaneous frequencies NMES and the two other NMES programmes in overall knee pain, knee function, or in quadriceps fatigue (an adverse event). Authors' conclusions This review found insufficient and inconclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform on the role of NMES for treating people with PFP in current clinical practice. The very low‐quality evidence available means that we are uncertain whether or not a multiple‐session programme of NMES combined with exercise over several weeks versus exercise alone results in clinically important differences in knee pain and function at the end of the treatment period or at one year. There were no data on adverse effects such as muscle fatigue and discomfort. High‐quality randomised clinical trials are needed to inform on the use of NMES for people with PFP. However, professional and stakeholder consensus is required on prioritisation of the research questions for interventions for treating people with PFP, including on the NMES treatment protocol for trials testing NMES.","Muscle stimulation for people with anterior knee pain Background Patellofemoral pain syndrome, commonly known as anterior knee pain, is characterised by short‐ or long‐term pain in the front part of the knee or behind the kneecap. Muscle stimulation has been proposed as a treatment for this condition. This involves the use of a device that produces a muscle contraction by placing electrodes on the skin of the leg. Muscle stimulation is often used together with exercises and other treatments but can also be used on its own. Results of the search We searched the medical literature up to May 2017 and found eight studies reporting results for a total of 345 participants who had anterior knee pain for at least one month, and sometimes over several years. Most of the participants were female. The average age of participants in the studies ranged from 25 to 43 years. All the studies were small and had flaws that meant they were at risk of bias. There was very little evidence on longer‐term outcome. The results of one study that reported on immediate pain after a single 15‐minute session of muscle stimulation are not reported here as these are of questionable clinical relevance. Key results Each of the seven remaining studies tested one of three comparisons. Four studies compared a multiple‐session muscle stimulation programme combined with exercise over several weeks with exercise on its own for the same period. All participants in two studies had adhesive tape applied across their knee cap, with ice also being applied in one study. We found very low‐quality evidence that muscle stimulation with exercise may slightly reduce knee pain at the end of a treatment period of between 3 and 12 weeks better than exercise alone. However, very low‐quality evidence did not show an effect on knee function. None of the studies reported on harms such as muscle fatigue and discomfort. There was very little useful information on longer‐term effects. One study compared muscle stimulation lasting four hours each day for four weeks with exercise. Very low‐quality evidence showed no important difference between the two groups in knee function at the end of the four‐week treatment. Of note is that the duration of muscle stimulation is much longer than used nowadays. Two studies compared different types of muscle stimulation. Very low‐quality evidence showed no important differences at the end of the six‐week treatment programme between the different types of muscle stimulation. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence for all reported outcomes was very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the findings of these studies. Conclusions We found insufficient evidence to inform on the role of neuromuscular electrical stimulation for treating people with anterior knee pain. Further research is needed.",CD011289
"Background Acute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome. Objectives To examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non‐pharmacological approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results Twenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes. Benzodiazepines versus placebo One trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours ( very low quality evidence ). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to 48 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97,  very low quality evidence ).    Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics When compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11,  low quality evidence ). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18,  very low quality evidence ). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience extrapyramidal effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41 , low quality evidence ). Benzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines When benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05,  low quality evidence ). However, for sedation, the results were controversial between two groups: lorazepam may lead to lower risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.98,  low quality evidence ); while, midazolam may lead to higher risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23,  low quality evidence ). Other combinations Data comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus benzodiazepines alone did not yield any results with clear differences; all were very low quality evidence. When comparing combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics (all studies compared haloperidol) with the same antipsychotics alone (haloperidol), there was no difference between groups in improvement in the medium term (n = 185, 4 RCTs, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46,  low quality evidence ), but sedation was more likely in people who received the combination therapy (n = 172, 3 RCTs, RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.67, very low quality evidence ). Only one study compared combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotics with antipsychotics; however, this study did not report our primary outcomes. One small study compared combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. Results showed a higher risk of no clinical improvement (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 25.00, 95% CI 1.55 to 403.99,  very low quality evidence ) and sedation status (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 12.00, 95% CI 1.66 to 86.59,  very low quality evidence)  in the combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics group. Authors' conclusions The evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high‐quality research is still needed in this area.","Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs for acute psychosis Review question The aim of this review was to compare the tranquillising (calming) or sedative (sleepiness) effects of benzodiazepines, given alone or combined with other drugs compared with the effect of placebo (a pretend treatment), other drugs or non‐drug treatments for people who are aggressive or agitated because they are experiencing psychoses. Background Acute psychosis is a rapid worsening of a person’s mental state where touch with reality is often lost. People may experience frightening delusions or hallucinations which are distressing and may cause agitated or aggressive behaviour. In urgent cases, this agitation or aggression may cause harm to the person experiencing the psychoses or others around them. To avoid such harm, rapid tranquillisation or sedation with medicines may be required. The most common medicines used to achieve a state of calmness or sedation are benzodiazepines and these can be given either alone or in combination with antipsychotics. Searching The original search for this review was carried out in January 2012 and subsequently two further update searches were run in August 2015 and August 2016. In total, these searches found 2497 records, which the review authors checked for inclusion or exclusion from the review. Authors included records only if they were randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that allocated people with acute psychosis who presented with agitation, violence aggressive behaviour (or a combination of these) to receive benzodiazepines either given alone or combined with any antipsychotics, versus placebo, antipsychotics alone or in combination with other antipsychotics/benzodiazepines/antihistamines or non‐drug treatments. Evidence found In total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear. Conclusions The existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good‐quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.",CD003079
"Background Virtual reality and interactive video gaming have emerged as recent treatment approaches in stroke rehabilitation with commercial gaming consoles in particular, being rapidly adopted in clinical settings. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published first in 2011 and then again in 2015. Objectives Primary objective: to determine the efficacy of virtual reality compared with an alternative intervention or no intervention on upper limb function and activity. Secondary objectives: to determine the efficacy of virtual reality compared with an alternative intervention or no intervention on: gait and balance, global motor function, cognitive function, activity limitation, participation restriction, quality of life, and adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (April 2017), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven additional databases. We also searched trials registries and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of virtual reality (""an advanced form of human‐computer interface that allows the user to 'interact' with and become 'immersed' in a computer‐generated environment in a naturalistic fashion"") in adults after stroke. The primary outcome of interest was upper limb function and activity. Secondary outcomes included gait and balance and global motor function. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre‐defined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated disagreements when required. The review authors contacted investigators to obtain missing information. Main results We included 72 trials that involved 2470 participants. This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review. Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the virtual reality devices used. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system. Control groups usually received no intervention or therapy based on a standard‐care approach. Primary outcome: results were not statistically significant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI) ‐0.05 to 0.20, 22 studies, 1038 participants, low‐quality evidence) when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy. However, when virtual reality was used in addition to usual care (providing a higher dose of therapy for those in the intervention group) there was a statistically significant difference between groups (SMD 0.49, 0.21 to 0.77, 10 studies, 210 participants, low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes: when compared to conventional therapy approaches there were no statistically significant effects for gait speed or balance. Results were statistically significant for the activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43, 10 studies, 466 participants, moderate‐quality evidence); however, we were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, or quality of life. Twenty‐three studies reported that they monitored for adverse events; across these studies there were few adverse events and those reported were relatively mild. Authors' conclusions We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming was not more beneficial than conventional therapy approaches in improving upper limb function. Virtual reality may be beneficial in improving upper limb function and activities of daily living function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time). There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation, or quality of life. This review found that time since onset of stroke, severity of impairment, and the type of device (commercial or customised) were not strong influencers of outcome. There was a trend suggesting that higher dose (more than 15 hours of total intervention) was preferable as were customised virtual reality programs; however, these findings were not statistically significant.","Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation Review question   We wanted to compare the effects of virtual reality versus an alternative treatment or no treatment on recovery after stroke using arm function and other outcomes such as walking speed and independence in managing daily activities after stroke. Background   Many people after having a stroke have difficulty moving, thinking, and sensing. This often results in problems with everyday activities such as writing, walking, and driving. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming are types of therapy being provided to people after having a stroke. The therapy involves using computer‐based programs designed to simulate real life objects and events. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming may have some advantages over traditional therapy approaches as they can give people an opportunity to practise everyday activities that are not or cannot be practised within the hospital environment. Furthermore, there are several features of virtual reality programs that might mean that patients spend more time in therapy: for example, the activity might be more motivating. Study characteristics   We identified 72 studies involving 2470 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used, with most aimed to improve either arm function or walking ability. The evidence is current to April 2017. Key results   Twenty‐two trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in an improved ability to use one's arm and found that the use of virtual reality did not result in better function (low‐quality evidence). When virtual reality was used in addition to usual care or rehabilitation to increase the amount of time the person spent in therapy there were improvements in the functioning of the arm (low‐quality evidence). Six trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more effective in this case (low‐quality evidence). Ten trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage everyday activities such as showering and dressing (moderate‐quality evidence). However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as, while there are a large number of studies, the studies are generally small and not of high quality. A small number of people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches, or dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence   The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies, and poor reporting of study details.",CD008349
"Background Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. Authors' conclusions Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Interventions for treating central venous catheter malfunction What is the issue? Patients who rely on haemodialysis due to kidney failure require vascular access and although not optimal, a tunnelled haemodialysis catheter is frequently used. Unfortunately, along with infection issues these lines are prone to dysfunction due to clotting and fibrin sheath formation. Medications such as alteplase have a recognised role in preventing line dysfunction but the best approach to treating established line dysfunction has not been found. What did we do? We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement. What did we find? We found eight studies involving 580 participants that tested the three different treatments. Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration. The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long‐term catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best. There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. Conclusions Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most effective technique for haemodialysis catheter dysfunction.",CD011953
"Background Medication‐related adverse events in primary care represent an important cause of hospital admissions and mortality. Adverse events could result from people experiencing adverse drug reactions (not usually preventable) or could be due to medication errors (usually preventable). Objectives To determine the effectiveness of professional, organisational and structural interventions compared to standard care to reduce preventable medication errors by primary healthcare professionals that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registries on 4 October 2016, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also searched several sources of grey literature. Selection criteria We included randomised trials in which healthcare professionals provided community‐based medical services. We also included interventions in outpatient clinics attached to a hospital where people are seen by healthcare professionals but are not admitted to hospital. We only included interventions that aimed to reduce medication errors leading to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, or mortality. We included all participants, irrespective of age, who were prescribed medication by a primary healthcare professional. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data. Each of the outcomes (hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality), are reported in natural units (i.e. number of participants with an event per total number of participants at follow‐up). We presented all outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE tool to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We included 30 studies (169,969 participants) in the review addressing various interventions to prevent medication errors; four studies addressed professional interventions (8266 participants) and 26 studies described organisational interventions (161,703 participants). We did not find any studies addressing structural interventions. Professional interventions included the use of health information technology to identify people at risk of medication problems, computer‐generated care suggested and actioned by a physician, electronic notification systems about dose changes, drug interventions and follow‐up, and educational interventions on drug use aimed at physicians to improve drug prescriptions. Organisational interventions included medication reviews by pharmacists, nurses or physicians, clinician‐led clinics, and home visits by clinicians. There is a great deal of diversity in types of professionals involved and where the studies occurred. However, most (61%) of the interventions were conducted by pharmacists or a combination of pharmacists and medical doctors. The studies took place in many different countries; 65% took place in either the USA or the UK. They all ranged from three months to 4.7 years of follow‐up, they all took place in primary care settings such as general practice, outpatients' clinics, patients' homes and aged‐care facilities. The participants in the studies were adults taking medications and the interventions were undertaken by healthcare professionals including pharmacists, nurses or physicians. There was also evidence of potential bias in some studies, with only 18 studies reporting adequate concealment of allocation and only 12 studies reporting appropriate protection from contamination, both of which may have influenced the overall effect estimate and the overall pooled estimate. Professional interventions Professional interventions probably make little or no difference to the number of hospital admissions (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.96; 2 studies, 3889 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Professional interventions make little or no difference to the number of participants admitted to hospital (adjusted RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 1 study, 3661 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Professional interventions may make little or no difference to the number of emergency department visits (adjusted RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1067 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Professional interventions probably make little or no difference to mortality in the study population (adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17; 1 study, 3538 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Organisational interventions Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce the number of hospital admissions (adjusted RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.03; 11 studies, 6203 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Overall, organisational interventions may make little difference to the total number of people admitted to hospital in favour of the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 13 studies, 152,237 participants; low‐certainty evidence. Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce the number of emergency department visits in favour of the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15; 5 studies, 1819 participants; very low‐certainty evidence. Overall, it is uncertain whether organisational interventions reduce mortality in favour of the intervention group (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.03; 12 studies, 154,962 participants; very low‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions Based on moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence, interventions in primary care for reducing preventable medication errors probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital or the number of hospitalisations, emergency department visits, or mortality. The variation in heterogeneity in the pooled estimates means that our results should be treated cautiously as the interventions may not have worked consistently across all studies due to differences in how the interventions were provided, background practice, and culture or delivery of the interventions. Larger studies addressing both professional and organisational interventions are needed before evidence‐based recommendations can be made. We did not identify any structural interventions and only four studies used professional interventions, and so more work needs to be done with these types of interventions. There is a need for high‐quality studies describing the interventions in more detail and testing patient‐related outcomes.","Actions to reduce medication errors in adults in primary care What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out the best way to reduce medication errors by primary healthcare professionals in adult patients that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and death. We wanted to know whether targeting individual health professionals (e.g. with educational materials and reminders about drug dosage etc.), changing the organisation of primary care (e.g. revising professional roles, such as nurse‐ or pharmacist‐led prescribing etc.), or structural actions, such as organising quality monitoring services can reduce medication errors by primary healthcare professionals. We collected and analysed relevant studies to answer this question and found 30 studies. Key messages The 30 studies (169,969 participants) in this Cochrane Review showed that actions aimed at reducing medication errors, such as medication reviews by pharmacists or physicians probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital, number of hospital admissions, number of emergency department visits, or death. In general, all the actions described in the review were found to have unclear benefits. We did not find any studies that fitted the criteria of structural actions. The main limitation of this review is the small number of studies addressing each method and the low‐certainty of the evidence. What was studied in the review? Prescribing medications is one of the most powerful tools available to general practitioners (GPs) in the prevention and treatment of disease. Medication‐related adverse events could be the result of people either experiencing adverse drug reactions (not usually preventable) or as a result of medication errors (usually preventable). We studied the effectiveness of professional and organisational methods compared to standard care in primary care settings (examples of primary care settings include general practices, community pharmacies, patient homes, community settings, outpatient clinics, and aged‐care facilities) to reduce preventable medication errors that lead to hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and death in adults who are prescribed medication in primary care. What are the main results of the review? We included 30 studies in our analysis. We classified 26 studies as organisational and the remaining four as professional actions. We found no structural actions in our search. The studies included in this Cochrane Review showed that based on moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence, actions in primary care for reducing preventable medication errors probably make little or no difference to the number of people admitted to hospital or the number of hospitalisations, emergency department visits, or death. Most of the studies took place in the UK and the USA; studies undertaken in high‐income countries with disadvantaged populations, and in low‐ and middle‐income countries, were underrepresented. This might affect the generalisation of the results. Certainty of the evidence We found the overall certainty of evidence for the professional actions to vary considerably across the reported outcomes: moderate‐certainty for number of hospital admissions, high‐certainty for number of people admitted to hospital, low‐certainty for number of emergency department visits, and moderate‐certainty for deaths. The certainty of evidence for organisational actions was less varied: very low‐certainty for number of hospital admissions, low‐certainty for number of people admitted to hospital, and very low‐certainty for number of emergency department visits and deaths. More work needs to be done in improving the quality of the studies regarding selection of participants and adequate blinding of participants and study assessors. Participants dropping out of the studies was another concern in the certainty of evidence. Funding of the included studies came from various sources and it is difficult to decide whether the funding affected the results of the studies. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to 4 October 2016.",CD003942
"Background Encephalitis is a syndrome of neurological dysfunction due to inflammation of the brain parenchyma, caused by an infection or an exaggerated host immune response, or both. Attenuation of brain inflammation through modulation of the immune response could improve patient outcomes. Biological agents such as immunoglobulin that have both anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties may therefore be useful as adjunctive therapies for people with encephalitis. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as add‐on treatment for children with encephalitis. Search methods The Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS group's Information Specialist searched the following databases up to 30 September 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP Search Portal. In addition, two review authors searched Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) & Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S) (Web of Science Core Collection, Thomson Reuters) (1945 to January 2016), Global Health Library (Virtual Health Library), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVIG in addition to standard care versus standard care alone or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, extracted relevant data, and assessed quality of trials. We resolved disagreements by discussion among the review authors. Where possible, we contacted authors of included studies for additional information. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results The search identified three RCTs with 138 participants. All three trials included only children with viral encephalitis, one of these included only children with Japanese encephalitis, a specific form of viral encephalitis. Only the trial of Japanese encephalitis (22 children) contributed to the primary outcome of this review and follow‐up in that study was for three to six months after hospital discharge. There was no follow‐up of participants in the other two studies. We identified one ongoing trial. For the primary outcomes, the results showed no significant difference between IVIG and placebo when used in the treatment of children with Japanese encephalitis: significant disability (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.60; P = 0.65) and serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.05; P = 1.00). For the secondary outcomes, the study of Japanese encephalitis showed no significant difference between IVIG and placebo when assessing significant disability at hospital discharge (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67). There was no significant difference (P = 0.53) in Glasgow Coma Score at discharge between IVIG (median score 14; range 3 to 15) and placebo (median 14 score; range 7 to 15) in the Japanese encephalitis study. The median length of hospital stay in the Japanese encephalitis study was similar for IVIG‐treated (median 13 days; range 9 to 21) and placebo‐treated (median 12 days; range 6 to 18) children (P = 0.59). Pooled analysis of the results of the other two studies resulted in a significantly lower mean length of hospital stay (MD ‐4.54 days, 95% CI ‐7.47 to ‐1.61; P = 0.002), time to resolution of fever (MD ‐0.97 days, 95% CI ‐1.25 to ‐0.69; P < 0.00001), time to stop spasms (MD ‐1.49 days, 95% CI ‐1.97 to ‐1.01; P < 0.00001), time to regain consciousness (MD ‐1.10 days, 95% CI ‐1.48 to ‐0.72; P < 0.00001), and time to resolution of neuropathic symptoms (MD ‐3.20 days, 95% CI ‐3.34 to ‐3.06; P < 0.00001) in favour of IVIG when compared with standard care. None of the included studies reported other outcomes of interest in this review including need for invasive ventilation, duration of invasive ventilation, cognitive impairment, poor adaptive functioning, quality of life, number of seizures, and new diagnosis of epilepsy. The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes of this review. Authors' conclusions The findings suggest a clinical benefit of adjunctive IVIG treatment for children with viral encephalitis for some clinical measures (i.e. mean length of hospital stay, time (days) to stop spasms, time to regain consciousness, and time to resolution of neuropathic symptoms and fever. For children with Japanese encephalitis, IVIG had a similar effect to placebo when assessing significant disability and serious adverse events. Despite these findings, the risk of bias in the included studies and quality of the evidence make it impossible to reach any firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of IVIG as add‐on treatment for children with encephalitis. Furthermore, the included studies involved only children with viral encephalitis, therefore findings of this review cannot be generalised to all forms of encephalitis. Future well‐designed RCTs are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of IVIG in the management of children with all forms of encephalitis. There is a need for internationally agreed core outcome measures for clinical trials in childhood encephalitis.","An assessment of the effectiveness and safety of a treatment used for children with encephalitis Background At present, there is uncertainty among clinicians regarding the routine use of a treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the management of children with some forms of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). This study is important because it is the first to evaluate through direct comparison whether adding IVIG to standard treatment has added beneficial effect in terms of clinical effectiveness and safety in the management of children with encephalitis. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for studies in which neither participants nor researchers were told which treatment was given (called a randomised double‐blind trial). The effectiveness and safety of IVIG were considered in terms of the occurrence of significant disability at six months after hospital discharge and the proportion of children experiencing at least one serious side effect. Key results and quality of evidence Up to 30 September 2016, only three studies comprising 138 children met the criteria to be included in this review. All three studies included only children with viral encephalitis. One study of Japanese encephalitis, a specific form of viral encephalitis, analysed both effectiveness and safety, and concluded that IVIG treatment had no additional beneficial effects when compared with placebo (pretend) treatment. The other two studies analysed other measurements, such as length of hospital stay, time to resolution of spasms, symptoms arising due to nerve damage, and time to regain consciousness and concluded that adding IVIG treatment was more effective than standard care alone when these outcomes were considered. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of children and studies. Conclusions The quality of evidence in the included studies was very low, making it impossible to draw any firm and definite conclusions on the clinical efficacy and safety of IVIG treatment for children with encephalitis. Furthermore, there was no information on funding while, for one study, the main authors' group was affiliated to the funding body: this is a well‐known potential source of conflict of interest and thus of bias.",CD011367
"Background Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation‐based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol‐related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost‐effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face‐to‐face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community‐based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face‐to‐face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta‐analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate‐quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate‐quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate‐quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate‐quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face‐to‐face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI ‐24.59 to 25.63; low‐quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B ‐43.94, 95% CI ‐78.59 to ‐9.30), problem solving (B ‐48.03, 95% CI ‐77.79 to ‐18.27), information about antecedents (B ‐74.20, 95% CI ‐117.72 to ‐30.68), behaviour substitution (B ‐123.71, 95% CI ‐184.63 to ‐62.80) and credible source (B ‐39.89, 95% CI ‐72.66 to ‐7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B ‐95.12, 95% CI ‐162.90 to ‐27.34), problem solving (B ‐45.92, 95% CI ‐90.97 to ‐0.87), and credible source (B ‐32.09, 95% CI ‐60.64 to ‐3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low‐quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face‐to‐face interventions. The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.","Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking? Review question We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face‐to‐face conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank. Background Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling, delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints (1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol. Search date Current to March 2017. Study characteristics   The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking into a computer or mobile device ‐ which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Study funding sources Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. Key results   We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face‐to‐face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face‐to‐face conversation. Quality of the evidence Evidence was moderate‐to‐low quality.",CD011479
"Background  Needle syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy for preventing hepatitis C transmission in people who inject drugs Needle syringe programmes (NSP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST) are the primary interventions to reduce hepatitis C (HCV) transmission in people who inject drugs. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of NSP and OST in reducing injecting risk behaviour and increasing evidence for the effectiveness of OST and NSP in reducing HIV acquisition risk, but the evidence on the effectiveness of NSP and OST for preventing HCV acquisition is weak. Objectives To assess the effects of needle syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy, alone or in combination, for preventing acquisition of HCV in people who inject drugs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Register, CENTRAL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, CINAHL, and the Web of Science up to 16 November 2015. We updated this search in March 2017, but we have not incorporated these results into the review yet. Where observational studies did not report any outcome measure, we asked authors to provide unpublished data. We searched publications of key international agencies and conference abstracts. We reviewed reference lists of all included articles and topic‐related systematic reviews for eligible papers. Selection criteria We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, cross‐sectional surveys, case‐control studies and randomised controlled trials that measured exposure to NSP and/or OST against no intervention or a reduced exposure and reported HCV incidence as an outcome in people who inject drugs. We defined interventions as current OST (within previous 6 months), lifetime use of OST and high NSP coverage (regular attendance at an NSP or all injections covered by a new needle/syringe) or low NSP coverage (irregular attendance at an NSP or less than 100% of injections covered by a new needle/syringe) compared with no intervention or reduced exposure. Data collection and analysis We followed the standard Cochrane methodological procedures incorporating new methods for classifying risk of bias for observational studies. We described study methods against the following 'Risk of bias' domains: confounding, selection bias, measurement of interventions, departures from intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes, selection of reported results; and we assigned a judgment (low, moderate, serious, critical, unclear) for each criterion. Main results We identified 28 studies (21 published, 7 unpublished): 13 from North America, 5 from the UK, 4 from continental Europe, 5 from Australia and 1 from China, comprising 1817 incident HCV infections and 8806.95 person‐years of follow‐up. HCV incidence ranged from 0.09 cases to 42 cases per 100 person‐years across the studies. We judged only two studies to be at moderate overall risk of bias, while 17 were at serious risk and 7 were at critical risk; for two unpublished datasets there was insufficient information to assess bias. As none of the intervention effects were generated from RCT evidence, we typically categorised quality as low. We found evidence that current OST reduces the risk of HCV acquisition by 50% (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.63, I 2  = 0%, 12 studies across all regions, N = 6361), but the quality of the evidence was low. The intervention effect remained significant in sensitivity analyses that excluded unpublished datasets and papers judged to be at critical risk of bias. We found evidence of differential impact by proportion of female participants in the sample, but not geographical region of study, the main drug used, or history of homelessness or imprisonment among study samples. Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence that high NSP coverage did not reduce risk of HCV acquisition (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.61) with high heterogeneity (I 2  = 77%) based on five studies from North America and Europe involving 3530 participants. After stratification by region, high NSP coverage in Europe was associated with a 76% reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.62) with less heterogeneity (I 2  =0%). We found low‐quality evidence of the impact of combined high coverage of NSP and OST, from three studies involving 3241 participants, resulting in a 74% reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition (RR 0.26 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89). Authors' conclusions OST is associated with a reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition, which is strengthened in studies that assess the combination of OST and NSP. There was greater heterogeneity between studies and weaker evidence for the impact of NSP on HCV acquisition. High NSP coverage was associated with a reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition in studies in Europe.","Interventions for reducing hepatitis C infection in people who inject drugs Review question We examine research on the effect of needle syringe programmes (NSP) and opioid substitution treatment (OST) in reducing the risk of becoming infected with the hepatitis C virus. Background There are around 114.9 million people living with hepatitis C and 3 to 4 million people newly infected each year. The main risk for becoming infected is sharing used needles/syringes. Almost half the people who inject drugs have hepatitis C. The provision of sterile injecting equipment through NSPs reduces the need for sharing equipment when preparing and injecting drugs. OST is taken orally and reduces frequency of injection and unsafe injecting practices. We examined whether NSP and OST, provided alone or together, are effective in reducing the chances of becoming infected with hepatitis C in people who inject drugs. Search date The evidence is current to November 2015. Study characteristics We identified 28 research studies across Europe, Australia, North America and China. On average across the studies, the rate of new hepatitis C infections per year was 19.0 for every 100 people. Data from 11,070 people who inject drugs who were not infected with hepatitis C at the start of the study were combined in the analysis. Of the sample, 32% were female, 50% injected opioids, 51% injected daily, and 40% had been homeless. Our study was funded by the National Institute of Health Research's (NIHR) Public Health Research Programme, the Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, and the European Commission Drug Prevention and Information Programme (DIPP), Treatment as Prevention in Europe: Model Projections. Key results Current use of OST (defined as use at the time of survey or within the previous six months) may reduce risk of acquiring hepatitis C by 50%. We are uncertain whether high coverage NSP (defined as regular attendance at an NSP or all injections being covered by a new needle/syringe) reduces the risk of becoming infected with hepatitis C across all studies globally, but there was some evidence from studies in Europe that high NSP coverage may reduce the risk of hepatitis C infection by 76%. The combined use of high coverage NSP with OST may reduce risk of hepatitis C infection by 74%. Quality of the evidence Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low because none of the studies used the gold standard design of randomised controlled trials.",CD012021
"Background Tuberculous pericarditis can impair the heart's function and cause death; long term, it can cause the membrane to fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard*' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and  Mycobacterium indicus pranii  treatment in a two‐by‐two factorial design ;  we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub‐Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV‐positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine,  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias. In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials,  low certainty evidence ) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials,  low certainty evidence ). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials,  moderate certainty evidence ). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people ( very low certainty evidence ). In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials,  low certainty evidence ). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all‐cause death or cancer ( very low certainty evidence ); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials,  low certainty evidence ). For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis. Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome. Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV‐negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial,  low certainty evidence ) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. Authors' conclusions For HIV‐negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV‐positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV‐positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV‐negative patients more relevant. Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens. 2 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (27 Mar, 2017) were included and one ongoing study was identified (see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' section)","Treatment for tuberculosis infection of the membrane around the heart What is the issue? Tuberculosis infection of the pericardium surrounding the heart is uncommon but life‐threatening. What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of treatments for people with tuberculous pericarditis. What is this important? Doctors prescribe antituberculous drugs for six months, drain fluid from the pericardium if the patient has heart failure, and sometimes remove the pericardium if it is thick and making the patient ill and sometimes give corticosteroids to reduce the effects of the inflammation. What are the main results of the review? Cochrane researchers collected and examined all potentially relevant studies and found seven trials, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Six trials evaluated corticosteroids. Other treatments evaluated included  Mycobacterium indicus pranii  immunotherapy, colchicine, and surgical removal of fluid under general anaesthesia. This review is a new edition of the 2002 review. In people not infected with HIV, six trials found that additional steroids may reduce deaths overall ( low certainty evidence ) and probably reduce deaths caused by pericarditis ( moderate certainty evidence ). Steroids may prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space ( low certainty evidence ). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people ( very low certainty evidence ). In people living with HIV, most people evaluated in the included trials were not on antiretroviral drugs. For these patients, corticosteroids may reduce constrictive pericarditis ( low certainty evidence ), but we do not know if this translates into a reduction in the number of deaths or cancer ( very low certainty evidence ). Corticosteroids may have little or no effect on reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space ( low certainty evidence ). Colchicine was evaluated in one trial of 33 people, with insufficient data to make any conclusions about an effect. Based on one trial, it is uncertain whether adding  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome in people with tuberculous pericarditis regardless of their HIV status ( very low certainty evidence ). Open surgical drainage of the fluid accumulating between the heart and the membrane using general anaesthesia may be associated with less life‐threatening reaccumulation of fluid in people who are not infected with HIV, but conclusions are not possible as the number of participants studied was too small. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.

"Background Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost, and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010 and 2013.  Objectives To evaluate the effects on clinical outcomes, antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance, and patient satisfaction of advising a  delayed  prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections. Search methods For this 2017 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2017), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE (2013 to 25 May 2017); Ovid Embase (2013 to 2017 Week 21); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1984 to 25 May 2017); Web of Science (2013 to 25 May 2017); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (1 September 2017); and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 September 2017). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages defined as having an RTI, where  delayed  antibiotics were compared to  immediate  antibiotics or  no  antibiotics. We defined a  delayed  antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Three review authors independently extracted and collated data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information. Main results For this 2017 update we added one new trial involving 405 participants with uncomplicated acute respiratory infection. Overall, this review included 11 studies with a total of 3555 participants. These 11 studies involved acute respiratory infections including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study), and a variety of RTIs (one study). Five studies involved only children, two only adults, and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in a primary care setting, three in paediatric clinics, and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported, and appeared to be of moderate certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcomes assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta‐analysis for antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. We found no differences among  delayed ,  immediate , and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in the three studies that recruited participants with cough. For the outcome of fever with sore throat, three of the five studies favoured  immediate  antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured  immediate  antibiotics, and three found no difference. One study compared  delayed  antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Three studies included participants with acute otitis media. Of the two studies with an  immediate  antibiotic arm, one study found no difference for fever, and the other study favoured  immediate  antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. One study including participants with acute otitis media compared  delayed  antibiotics with  no  antibiotics and found no difference for pain and fever on Day 3. Two studies recruited participants with common cold. Neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between  delayed  and  immediate  antibiotic groups. One study favoured  delayed  antibiotics over  no  antibiotics for pain, fever, and cough duration (moderate certainty evidence for all clinical outcomes). There were either no differences for adverse effects or results favoured  delayed  antibiotics over  immediate  antibiotics (low certainty evidence) with no significant differences in complication rates. Delayed  antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to  immediate  antibiotics prescription (odds ratio (OR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.05). However, a  delayed  antibiotic was more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than  no  antibiotics (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.08; moderate certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction favoured  delayed  over  no  antibiotics (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.06). There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between  delayed  antibiotics and  immediate  antibiotics (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10; moderate certainty evidence). None of the included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Authors' conclusions For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by  immediate  antibiotics compared with  delayed  antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over  no  antibiotics (87% versus 82%).  Delayed  antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to  immediate  antibiotics (31% versus 93%; moderate certainty evidence). The strategy of  no  antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (14% versus 28%). Delayed  antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to  immediate  antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to  no  antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with respiratory infections,  no  antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delaying prescription of antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in using a no antibiotic strategy, a  delayed  antibiotics strategy may be an acceptable compromise in place of  immediate  prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, and thereby reduce antibiotic resistance, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels.

Background Prescribing too many antibiotics increases the risk of adverse reactions and results in higher healthcare costs and increased antibacterial resistance. One strategy to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing is to provide an antibiotic prescription, but with advice to delay filling the prescription. The prescriber assesses that  immediate  antibiotics are not immediately required, expecting that symptoms will resolve without antibiotics. We included all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were indicated or not. We also evaluated antibiotic use, patient satisfaction, antibiotic resistance, reconsultation rates, and use of supplemental therapies. This is an update of a review first published in 2007 and updated in 2010, 2013, and 2017. Search date Evidence is current to 25 th  May 2017. Study characteristics We included 11 trials with a total of 3555 participants evaluating prescribing strategies for people with respiratory tract infections. Ten of these studies compared strategies of  delaying  antibiotics with  immediate  antibiotics. Four studies compared  delayed  antibiotics with  no  antibiotics. Of the 11 studies, five included only children (1173 participants), two included only adults (594 participants), and four included children and adults (1761 participants). The studies investigated a variety of respiratory tract infections. One study involving 405 participants was new for this update. Study funding sources Two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two studies did not describe the funding sources, and the remaining seven studies were funded by state institutions or specialist college. Key results There were no differences between  immediate ,  delayed , and  no  antibiotics for many symptoms including fever, pain, feeling unwell, cough, and runny nose. The only differences were small and favoured  immediate  antibiotics for relieving pain, fever, and runny nose for sore throat; and pain and feeling unwell for middle ear infections. Compared to  no  antibiotics,  delayed  antibiotics led to a small reduction in how long pain, fever, and cough persisted in people with colds. There was little difference in antibiotic adverse effects, and no significant difference in complications. Patient satisfaction was similar for people who trialled  delayed  antibiotics (86% satisfied) compared to  immediate  antibiotics (91% satisfied), but was greater than  no  antibiotics (87% versus 82% satisfied). Antibiotic use was greatest in the  immediate  antibiotic group (93%), followed by  delayed  antibiotics (31%), and  no  antibiotics (14%). In the first month after the initial consultation, two studies indicated that participants were no more likely to come back and see the doctor for  delayed  or  immediate  prescribing groups. Excluding the first month, one study found that participants were no more likely to return to see the doctor in the 12 months after the  delayed  or  immediate  prescription for another respiratory infection, and another study found that participants were more likely to come back and see the doctor in the next 12 months if they had had an  immediate  prescription compared to a  delayed  prescription. Two studies including children with acute otitis media reported on the use of other medicines in  delayed  and  immediate  antibiotic groups. There was no difference in the use of ibuprofen, paracetamol, and otic drops in one study. In the other study, fewer spoons of paracetamol were used in the  immediate  antibiotic group compared with the  delayed  antibiotic group on the second and third day after the child's initial presentation. No included studies evaluated herbal or other forms of complementary medicine. No included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Certainty of the evidence Overall, the certainty of the evidence was moderate according to GRADE assessment. When doctors feel it is safe not to  immediately  prescribe antibiotics, advising  no  antibiotics but to return if symptoms do not resolve, rather than  delayed  antibiotics, will result in lower antibiotic use. However, patient satisfaction may be greater when a  delayed  prescribing strategy is used. Using a  delayed  antibiotic strategy will still result in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to the use of  immediate  antibiotics.

"Background Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health threat. Interventions that reduce antibiotic prescribing by clinicians are expected to reduce antibiotic resistance. Disparate interventions to change antibiotic prescribing behaviour for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) have been trialled and meta‐analysed, but not yet synthesised in an overview. This overview synthesises evidence from systematic reviews, rather than individual trials. Objectives To systematically review the existing evidence from systematic reviews on the effects of interventions aimed at influencing clinician antibiotic prescribing behaviour for ARIs in primary care. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Science Citation Index to June 2016. We also searched the reference lists of all included reviews. We ran a pre‐publication search in May 2017 and placed additional studies in 'awaiting classification'. We included both Cochrane and non‐Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of any clinician‐focussed intervention on antibiotic prescribing behaviour in primary care. Two overview authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using the ROBIS tool, with disagreements reached by consensus or by discussion with a third overview author. We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence in included reviews. The results are presented as a narrative overview. Main results We included eight reviews in this overview: five Cochrane Reviews (33 included trials) and three non‐Cochrane reviews (11 included trials). Three reviews (all Cochrane Reviews) scored low risk across all the ROBIS domains in Phase 2 and low risk of bias overall. The remaining five reviews scored high risk on Domain 4 of Phase 2 because the 'Risk of bias' assessment had not been specifically considered and discussed in the review Results and Conclusions. The trials included in the reviews varied in both size and risk of bias. Interventions were compared to usual care. Moderate‐quality evidence indicated that C‐reactive protein (CRP) point‐of‐care testing (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92, 3284 participants, 6 trials), shared decision making (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75, 3274 participants, 3 trials; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84, 4623 participants, 2 trials; risk difference ‐18.44, 95% CI ‐27.24 to ‐9.65, 481,807 participants, 4 trials), and procalcitonin‐guided management (adjusted OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.14, 1008 participants, 2 trials) probably reduce antibiotic prescribing in general practice. We found moderate‐quality evidence that procalcitonin‐guided management probably reduces antibiotic prescribing in emergency departments (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.43, 2605 participants, 7 trials). The overall effect of these interventions was small (few achieving greater than 50% reduction in antibiotic prescribing, most about a quarter or less), but likely to be clinically important. Compared to usual care, shared decision making probably makes little or no difference to reconsultation for the same illness (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03, 1860 participants, 4 trials, moderate‐quality evidence), and may make little or no difference to patient satisfaction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.30, 1110 participants, 2 trials, low‐quality evidence). Similarly, CRP testing probably has little or no effect on patient satisfaction (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.08, 689 participants, 2 trials, moderate‐quality evidence) or reconsultation (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27, 5132 participants, 4 trials, moderate‐quality evidence). Procalcitonin‐guided management probably results in little or no difference in treatment failure in general practice compared to normal care (adjusted OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24, 1008 participants, 2 trials, moderate‐quality evidence), however it probably reduces treatment failure in the emergency department compared to usual care (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95, 2605 participants, 7 trials, moderate‐quality evidence). The quality of evidence for interventions focused on clinician educational materials and decision support in reducing antibiotic prescribing in general practice was either low or very low (no pooled result reported) and trial results were highly heterogeneous, therefore we were unable draw conclusions about the effects of these interventions. The use of rapid viral diagnostics in emergency departments may have little or no effect on antibiotic prescribing (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.22, 891 participants, 3 trials, low‐quality evidence) and may result in little to no difference in reconsultation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25, 200 participants, 1 trial, low‐quality evidence). None of the trials in the included reviews reported on management costs for the treatment of an ARI or any associated complications. Authors' conclusions We found evidence that CRP testing, shared decision making, and procalcitonin‐guided management reduce antibiotic prescribing for patients with ARIs in primary care. These interventions may therefore reduce overall antibiotic consumption and consequently antibiotic resistance. There do not appear to be negative effects of these interventions on the outcomes of patient satisfaction and reconsultation, although there was limited measurement of these outcomes in the trials. This should be rectified in future trials. We could gather no information about the costs of management, and this along with the paucity of measurements meant that it was difficult to weigh the benefits and costs of implementing these interventions in practice. Most of this research was undertaken in high‐income countries, and it may not generalise to other settings. The quality of evidence for the interventions of educational materials and tools for patients and clinicians was either low or very low, which prevented us from drawing any conclusions. High‐quality trials are needed to further investigate these interventions.","Strategies to help doctors change the way they prescribe antibiotics for patients with acute respiratory infections Overview question This overview aimed to summarise all evidence from systematic reviews on strategies directed at doctors to reduce the antibiotic prescriptions they give to patients with acute respiratory infections (ear, nose, throat or chest infections). Background It is important that antibiotics are used for illnesses where they can make a difference to patients’ symptoms and recovery and that they are available for those infections that are serious and can lead to disability or death. Antibiotics may make very little or no difference for patients who have ear, nose, throat, or chest infections that are caused by a virus (e.g. a cold, flu, or sore throat). Doctors can prescribe antibiotics too readily for patients with these symptoms. Strategies to change doctors’ antibiotic prescribing habits have been developed to reduce the number of antibiotics given to patients with these symptoms. Several types of strategies exist, and it is important to bring together all the information on how these work. Study characteristics We identified five Cochrane Reviews and three non‐Cochrane reviews. The reviews varied in how many trials they included and the number of participants within trials. The quality of both the reviews and trials varied. Key results We found moderate‐quality evidence that three types of strategies probably help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Strategies that encourage the use of shared decision making between doctors and their patients, C‐reactive protein tests, and procalcitonin‐guided management (both tests that measure the amount of proteins in the blood, which may be raised in the case of infection) all probably reduce antibiotic prescribing in general practice. Procalcitonin‐guided management also probably reduces antibiotic prescribing in emergency departments. These strategies seem to change antibiotic prescribing whilst keeping patients happy with their consultation and ensuring that they did not need to return to their doctor for the same illness. There was no information about the cost of these strategies, so it was difficult to weigh up the benefits and costs. The quality of the evidence for strategies that aim to educate doctors about antibiotic prescribing, that provide decision aids for doctors to help them change their prescribing, and for the use of rapid viral diagnostics in emergency departments was either low or very low, meaning that we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effects of these strategies. In conclusion, we determined that some strategies aimed at doctors can probably help to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Further studies are needed for other types of strategies where there is less information about whether they can change prescribing.",CD012252
"Background Strategies to reduce the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV‐positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks, elective Caesarean section delivery, and avoiding giving children chewed food. In some settings, these interventions may not be practical, feasible, or affordable. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions (that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes) would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low‐cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings. Objectives To summarize the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy and after delivery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 25 August 2017, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting that compared vitamin A supplements to placebo or no intervention among HIV‐positive women during pregnancy or after delivery, or both. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) as appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses. This is an update of a review last published in 2011. Main results Five trials met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005 and none of the participants received ART. Women allocated to intervention arms received vitamin A supplements at a variety of doses (daily during pregnancy; a single dose immediately after delivery, or daily doses during pregnancy plus a single dose after delivery). Women allocated to comparison arms received identical placebo (6601 women, 4 trials) or no intervention (697 women, 1 trial). Four trials (with 6995 women) had low risk of bias and one trial (with 303 women) had high risk of attrition bias. The trials show that giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.26; 4428 women, 5 trials,  moderate certainty evidence ) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; 3883 women, 3 trials,  low certainty evidence ). However, giving vitamin A supplements during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight (MD 34.12 g, 95% CI −12.79 to 81.02; 2181 women, 3 trials,  low certainty evidence ) and probably reduces the incidence of low birthweight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97; 1819 women, 3 trials,  moderate certainty evidence);  but we do not know whether vitamin A supplements affect the risk of preterm delivery (1577 women, 2 trials), stillbirth (2335 women, 3 trials), or maternal death (1267 women, 2 trials). Authors' conclusions Antepartum or postpartum vitamin A supplementation, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV in women living with HIV infection and not on antiretroviral drugs. The intervention has largely been superseded by ART which is widely available and effective in preventing vertical transmission. 2 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search Updated review: all eligible published studies found in the last search (25 Aug, 2017) were included","Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection What is the aim of this review? The main aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women, during pregnancy or after delivery, or both, on the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection. Cochrane researchers collected and examined all relevant studies to answer this question and included five trials. This is an update of a review last published in 2011. What is the key message of this review? Giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women, during pregnancy or after delivery, or both, probably makes little or no difference to the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV ( moderate certainty evidence ). What are the main results of the review? Five trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. Two trials were from South Africa and one trial each from Malawi, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. The trials compared women receiving vitamin A supplements to women not receiving such supplements. None of the participants received antiretroviral therapy (ART). The review shows that in women living with HIV infection and not on ART: ‐ giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy, immediately after delivery, or both, probably has little or no effect on the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV ( moderate certainty evidence ) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age ( low certainty evidence ); ‐ giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight ( low certainty evidence ) and probably reduces the number of low birthweight babies ( moderate certainty evidence ), but it is uncertain whether the intervention has an effect on the number of preterm births, stillbirths, or deaths among the women ( very low certainty evidence ). The intervention has largely been superseded by ART, which is widely available and effective in preventing mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV. How up‐to‐date is this review?

"Background During pregnancy, fetal cells suitable for genetic testing can be obtained from amniotic fluid by amniocentesis (AC), placental tissue by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or fetal blood. A major disadvantage of second trimester amniocentesis is that the results are available relatively late in pregnancy (after 16 weeks' gestation). Earlier alternatives are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and early amniocentesis, which can be performed in the first trimester of pregnancy. Objectives The objective of this review was to compare the safety and accuracy of all types of AC (i.e. early and late) and CVS (e.g. transabdominal, transcervical) for prenatal diagnosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (3 March 2017),  ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ; 3 March 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing AC and CVS by either transabdominal or transcervical route. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results We included a total of 16 randomised studies, with a total of 33,555 women, 14 of which were deemed to be at low risk of bias. The number of women included in the trials ranged from 223 to 4606. Studies were categorized into six comparisons: 1. second trimester AC versus control; 2. early versus second trimester AC; 3. CVS versus second trimester AC; 4. CVS methods; 5. Early AC versus CVS; and 6. AC with or without ultrasound. One study compared second trimester AC with no AC (control) in a low risk population (women = 4606). Background pregnancy loss was around 2%. Second trimester AC compared to no testing increased total pregnancy loss by another 1%. The confidence intervals (CI) around this excess risk were relatively large (3.2% versus 2.3 %, average risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.00; moderate‐quality evidence). In the same study, spontaneous miscarriages were also higher (2.1% versus 1.3%; average RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.52; high‐quality evidence). The number of congenital anomalies was similar in both groups (2.0% versus 2.2%, average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.39; moderate‐quality evidence). One study (women = 4334) found that early amniocentesis was not a safe early alternative compared to second trimester amniocentesis because of increased total pregnancy losses (7.6% versus 5.9%; average RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61; high‐quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (3.6% versus 2.5%, average RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.98; moderate‐quality evidence), and a higher incidence of congential anomalies, including talipes (4.7% versus 2.7%; average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.38; high‐quality evidence). When pregnancy loss after CVS was compared with second trimester AC, there was a clinically significant heterogeneity in the size and direction of the effect depending on the technique used (transabdominal or transcervical), therefore, the results were not pooled. Only one study compared transabdominal CVS with second trimester AC (women = 2234). They found no clear difference between the two procedures in the total pregnancy loss (6.3% versus 7%; average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.23, low‐quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (3.0% versus 3.9%; average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.21; low‐quality evidence), and perinatal deaths (0.7% versus 0.6%; average RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.51; low‐quality evidence). Transcervical CVS may carry a higher risk of pregnancy loss (14.5% versus 11.5%; average RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81), but the results were quite heterogeneous. Five studies compared transabdominal and transcervical CVS (women = 7978). There were no clear differences between the two methods in pregnancy losses (average RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.65; very low‐quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (average RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.58; very low‐quality evidence), or anomalies (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.12; low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low due to heterogeneity between studies. Transcervical CVS may be more technically demanding than transabdominal CVS, with more failures to obtain sample (2.0% versus 1.1%; average RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.82, moderate‐quality evidence). Overall, we found low‐quality evidence for outcomes when early amniocentesis was compared to transabdominal CVS. Spontaneous miscarriage was the only outcome supported by moderate‐quality evidence, resulting in more miscarriages after early AC compared with transabdominal CVS (2.3% versus 1.3%; average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60). There were no clear differences in pregnancy losses (average RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54; low‐quality evidence), or anomalies (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.30; very low‐quality evidence). We found one study that examined AC with or without ultrasound, which evaluated a type of ultrasound‐assisted procedure that is now considered obsolete. Authors' conclusions Second trimester amniocentesis increased the risk of pregnancy loss, but it was not possible to quantify this increase precisely from only one study, carried out more than 30 years ago. Early amniocentesis was not as safe as second trimester amniocentesis, illustrated by increased pregnancy loss and congenital anomalies (talipes). Transcervical chorionic villus sampling compared with second trimester amniocentesis may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss, but results were quite heterogeneous. Diagnostic accuracy of different methods could not be assessed adequately because of incomplete karyotype data in most studies.","Amniocentesis and placental sampling for pre‐birth diagnosis What is the issue? Many women want to be reassured that their unborn baby is healthy. Second trimester amniocentesis performed around 16 weeks' gestation is the test most often used. A needle is inserted through the abdomen into the uterus to remove a sample of amniotic fluid. Early amniocentesis can be done before 15 weeks. With chorionic villus sampling, a needle is used to withdraw a sample of placental tissue. The needle can be inserted through the abdomen (transabdominal), or vaginally through the cervix (transcervical). Why is this important? It is important that tests used to indicate high‐risk (screening tests), and tests used to make a diagnosis (diagnostic tests) are safe and accurate. It is also important that diagnostic tests can be done early enough to allow parents the choice of early termination of pregnancy. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence on 3 March 2017; we included 16 randomised controlled trials in the review, with a total of 33,555 women. The overall risk of bias was low, with very low to high‐quality evidence supporting the outcomes studied. One study of 4606 women found that a second trimester amniocentesis increased spontaneous miscarriages and pregnancy losses, but the estimate remains quite imprecise, ranging from 0 to 2%. Early amniocentesis was not as safe as second trimester amniocentesis because of increased pregnancy loss and spontaneous miscarriages, and higher occurrences of anomalies, particularly deformed or clubfeet (talipes). Low‐quality evidence found no clear differences in pregnancy loss or spontaneous miscarriages after transabdominal chorionic villus sampling or second trimester amniocentesis. Transcervical chorionic villus sampling may increase the total risk of pregnancy loss compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, mostly because of increased spontaneous miscarriages. Healthcare staff may have found transcervical chorionic villus sampling more difficult to perform than transabdominal chorionic villus sampling, because there were more failures to obtain a sample, and more repeat testing. What does this mean? High‐quality evidence supported second trimester amniocentesis as the procedure of first choice for testing from 15 weeks' gestation or later. When a test is required earlier than 15 weeks' gestation, low‐quality to moderate‐quality evidence suggested that transabdominal chorionic villus sampling could be considered the procedure of first choice, depending on the outcome of interest.",CD003252
"Background Cerebral injury and long‐term neurodevelopmental impairment is common in extremely preterm infants. Cerebral near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) enables continuous estimation of cerebral oxygenation. This diagnostic method coupled with appropriate interventions if NIRS is out of normal range (that is cerebral oxygenation within the 55% to 85% range) may offer benefits without causing more harms. Therefore, NIRS coupled with appropriate responses to abnormal findings on NIRS needs assessment in a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and quasi‐randomised studies. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions that attempt to alter cerebral oxygenation guided by cerebral NIRS monitoring in order to prevent cerebral injury, improve neurological outcome, and increase survival in preterm infants born more than 8 weeks preterm. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 10 September 2016), Embase (1980 to 10 September 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 10 September 2016). We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised clinical trials and quasi‐randomised studies. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials and quasi‐randomised clinical studies comparing continuous cerebral NIRS monitoring for at least 24 hours versus blinded NIRS or versus no NIRS monitoring. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of, and extracted data from the included trials and studies. If necessary, we contacted authors for further information. We conducted assessments of risks of bias; risks of design errors; and controlled the risks of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence with GRADE. Main results One randomised clinical trial met inclusion criteria, including infants born more than 12 weeks preterm. The trial employed adequate methodologies and was assessed at low risk of bias. One hundred and sixty‐six infants were randomised to start continuous cerebral NIRS monitoring less than 3 hours after birth until 72 hours after birth plus appropriate interventions if NIRS was out of normal range according to a guideline versus conventional monitoring with blinded NIRS. There was no effect of NIRS plus guideline of mortality until term‐equivalent age (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.00; one trial; 166 participants). There were no effects of NIRS plus guideline on intraventricular haemorrhages: all grades (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; one trial; 166 participants); grade III/IV (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.31; one trial; 166 participants); and cystic periventricular leukomalacia (which did not occur in either group). Likewise, there was no effect of NIRS plus guideline on the occurrence of a patent ductus arteriosus (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.08; one trial; 166 participants); chronic lung disease (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.50; one trial; 166 participants); necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; one trial; 166 participants); and retinopathy of prematurity (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.00; one trial; 166 participants). There were no serious adverse events in any of the intervention groups. NIRS plus guideline caused more skin marks from the NIRS sensor in the control group than in the experimental group (unadjusted RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.92; one trial; 166 participants). There are no data regarding neurodevelopmental outcome, renal impairment or air leaks. The quality of evidence for all comparisons discussed above was assessed as very low apart from all‐cause mortality and adverse events: these were assessed as low and moderate, respectively. The validity of all comparisons is hampered by a small sample of randomised infants, risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and indirectness of outcomes. Authors' conclusions The only eligible randomised clinical trial did not demonstrate any consistent effects of NIRS plus a guideline on the assessed clinical outcomes. The trial was, however, only powered to detect difference in cerebral oxygenation, not morbidities or mortality. Our systematic review did not reach sufficient power to prove or disprove effects on clinical outcomes. Further randomised clinical trials with low risks of bias and low risks of random errors are needed.","Cerebral near‐infrared spectroscopy monitoring for prevention of brain injury in very preterm infants Review question   To determine the benefits and harms of continuous non‐invasive estimation of the oxygen levels of the brain tissue by near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on mortality and later development in infants born more than 8 weeks preterm. Background   Babies born more than 8 weeks before term are at risk of brain injury and developmental impairment. NIRS enables the oxygen content of the brain tissue to be measured continuously by emitting different light waves in the near‐infrared range into the tissue and measuring the reflected light intensity a few inches away from the light source. It has been proposed that avoiding very low or very high oxygen levels in the brain could be beneficial in these small infants. Study characteristics In evidence current to September 2016, we found one trial that primarily tested if brain oxygenation can be stabilised by combining NIRS measurements of the brain with a treatment guideline on how to intervene when the brain oxygenation is outside the normal range. The 166 infants included were born more than 12 weeks before term. They were monitored during the first three days of life. The study was funded by government agency, and we found that the methods used in trial were as good as possible. Key results   The single trial we found showed a large and significant difference in brain oxygenation between the experimental group and the control group. Low oxygenation was far more common in the control group. It did not, however, find that monitoring with NIRS reduces mortality or the occurrence of the most common complications of very preterm birth, i.e. intracranial bleedings, chronic lung disease, damage of the intestines (necrotising enterocolitis), and blindness (retinopathy of prematurity). The NIRS monitoring did not cause serious harm, but skin marks from the NIRS sensor were seen in about 1 in 10 patients. Quality of evidence   The accrued information size with one small randomised trial is too small to conclude anything about the benefits and harms of cerebral near‐infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants. Thus further studies are needed.",CD011506
"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of illness and death in HIV‐positive children living in areas of high TB prevalence. We know that isoniazid prophylaxis prevents TB in HIV‐negative children following TB exposure, but there is uncertainty related to its role in TB preventive treatment in HIV‐positive children. Objectives To summarise the effects of TB preventive treatment versus placebo in HIV‐positive children with no known TB contact on active TB, death, and reported adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and two trial registers up to February 2017. Selection criteria We included trials of HIV‐positive children with and without known TB exposure, randomized to receive TB preventive treatment or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently used the study selection criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed effects using risk, incidence rate and hazard ratios and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included three trials, involving 991 participants, below the age of 13 years, from South Africa and Botswana. Children were randomized to isoniazid prophylaxis or placebo, given daily or three times weekly. The median length of follow‐up ranged from 5.7 to 34 months; some were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In HIV‐positive children not on ART, isoniazid prophylaxis may reduce the risk of active TB (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.87; 1 trial, 240 participants,  low certainty evidence ), and death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.95; 1 trial, 240 participants,  low certainty evidence ). One trial (182 participants) reported number of children with laboratory adverse events, which was similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups. No clinical adverse events were reported. In HIV‐positive children on ART, we do not know if isoniazid prophylaxis reduces the risk of active TB (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 3 trials, 737 participants,  very low certainty evidence ) or death (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.72; 3 trials, 737 participants,  very low certainty evidence ). Two trials (714 participants) reported number of clinical adverse events and three trials (795 participants) reported number of laboratory adverse events; for both categories, the number of adverse events were similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups. Authors' conclusions Isoniazid prophylaxis given to all children diagnosed with HIV may reduce the risk of active TB and death in HIV‐positive children not on ART in studies from Africa. For children on ART, no clear benefit was detected. . 12 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (17 Feb, 2017) were included","Isoniazid prophylaxis for preventing active tuberculosis and death in HIV‐positive children What was the aim of this review? To summarise the effects of isoniazid prophylaxis on TB, death, and adverse effects in HIV‐positive children. Key messages In areas of high tuberculosis endemicity, isoniazid prophylaxis prevents active TB and death in HIV‐positive children who are not on ART. We conducted a review to assess the effect of TB medication on active TB or death and its safety in HIV‐positive children. What was studied in the review? TB is a common cause of severe lung disease and death in HIV‐positive children. Childhood TB is common in poor countries, especially those with a coexisting burden of HIV/AIDS disease. HIV‐positive children have a higher risk of developing TB than HIV‐negative children. Isoniazid prevents TB in HIV‐positive adults and is currently used in children who are at high risk of developing TB disease after exposure to someone with TB. However, there is limited information on the effect of isoniazid medication in reducing active TB or death if given to HIV‐positive children without known TB contact. We searched for studies up to 17 February 2017, and found three studies published between 2007 and 2014 that addressed the effect of isoniazid medication compared to no medication on active TB and death in 991 HIV‐positive children, below the age of 13 years. Most of the children were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the studies were conducted in South Africa and Botswana. The median length of follow‐up ranged from 5.7 to 34 months. What are the main results of the review? In HIV‐positive children not taking ART, isoniazid medication reduced the number of children developing active TB by 69% ( low certainty evidence ), and death by 54% ( low certainty evidence ). One trial was conducted in HIV‐positive children taking ART, and this did not detect any benefit or harm of isoniazid ( very low certainty evidence) . The number of children with adverse effects were similar in children receiving isoniazid medication as the control group in both children on ART and not on ART. How up to date is the review? The review authors searched for studies published up to February 2017.",CD006418
"Background Neuroblastoma is a rare malignant disease and mainly affects infants and very young children. The tumours mainly develop in the adrenal medullary tissue, with an abdominal mass as the most common presentation. About 50% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis. The high‐risk group is characterised by metastasis and other features that increase the risk of an adverse outcome. High‐risk patients have a five‐year event‐free survival of less than 50%. Retinoic acid has been shown to inhibit growth of human neuroblastoma cells and has been considered as a potential candidate for improving the outcome of patients with high‐risk neuroblastoma. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional retinoic acid as part of a postconsolidation therapy after high‐dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared to placebo retinoic acid or to no additional retinoic acid in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma (as defined by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE in  PubMed  (1946 to 24 November 2016), and Embase in  Ovid  (1947 to 24 November 2016). Further searches included trial registries (on 22 December 2016), conference proceedings (on 23 March 2017) and reference lists of recent reviews and relevant studies. We did not apply limits by publication year or languages. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating additional retinoic acid after HDCT followed by HSCT for people with high‐risk neuroblastoma compared to placebo retinoic acid or to no additional retinoic acid. Primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related mortality. Secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, event‐free survival, early toxicity, late toxicity, and health‐related quality of life. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results The update search did not identify any additional studies. We identified one RCT that included people with high‐risk neuroblastoma who received HDCT followed by autologous HSCT (N = 98) after a first random allocation and who received retinoic acid (13‐cis‐retinoic acid; N = 50) or no further therapy (N = 48) after a second random allocation. These 98 participants had no progressive disease after HDCT followed by autologous HSCT. There was no clear evidence of difference between the treatment groups either in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.63; one trial; P = 0.66) or in event‐free survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49; one trial; P = 0.59). We calculated the HR values using the complete follow‐up period of the trial. The study also reported overall survival estimates at a fixed point in time. At the time point of five years, the survival estimate was reported to be 59% for the retinoic acid group and 41% for the no‐further‐therapy group (P value not reported). We did not identify results for treatment‐related mortality, progression‐free survival, early or late toxicity, or health‐related quality of life. We could not rule out the possible presence of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and other bias. We judged the evidence to be of low quality for overall survival and event‐free survival, downgraded because of study limitations and imprecision. Authors' conclusions We identified one RCT that evaluated additional retinoic acid as part of a postconsolidation therapy after HDCT followed by autologous HSCT versus no further therapy in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. There was no clear evidence of a difference in overall survival and event‐free survival between the treatment alternatives. This could be the result of low power. Information on other outcomes was not available. This trial was performed in the 1990s, since when many changes in treatment and risk classification have occurred. Based on the currently available evidence, we are therefore uncertain about the effects of retinoic acid in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. More research is needed for a definitive conclusion.","Retinoic acid after intensive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of adding retinoic acid as part of a postconsolidation therapy after intensive chemotherapy (high‐dose chemotherapy) followed by autologous (from the same person) bone marrow transplantation (haematopoietic stem cell transplantation) in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. A consolidation therapy tries to destroy possible remnant cancer cells after a preceding therapy has achieved the elimination of detectable tumour. A postconsolidation therapy is applied after that consolidation therapy. The addition of retinoic acid was compared to the same pretreatment but placebo (inactive) retinoic acid or no addition of retinoic acid for two primary and five secondary outcomes. The primary outcomes were overall survival (participants who did not die) and treatment‐related mortality (participants who died due to complications of the intervention). Secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival (the condition did not worsen), event‐free survival (staying free of any of a particular group of events), early and late toxicity (harmful effects), and health‐related quality of life. Background Neuroblastoma is a rare cancerous disease and mainly affects infants and very young children. The high‐risk group is prone to spread of the disease and other characteristics that increase the risk of an adverse event. Retinoic acid stops uncontrolled cell growth in laboratory cell cultures and might reduce the return of the tumour after high‐dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 24 November 2016. We included a single randomised trial with 50 people allocated to the addition of retinoic acid after high‐dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 48 people allocated to the same treatment but without the addition of retinoic acid. Key results The update search did not identify any new studies. Overall survival and event‐free survival were no different between the two treatment alternatives. Other outcomes, including those concerning adverse events, were not adequately reported. Additional retinoic acid as part of a postconsolidation therapy after high‐dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may not improve survival in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma, and we lack information on its safety. More research is needed before we can draw solid conclusions. Quality of the evidence The evidence is based on a single study. The quality of the evidence in this single included study is low.",CD010685
"Background Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterine cavity. This condition is oestrogen‐dependent and thus is seen primarily during the reproductive years. Owing to their antiproliferative effects in the endometrium, progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs) have been advocated for treatment of endometriosis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of PRMs primarily in terms of pain relief as compared with other treatments or placebo or no treatment in women of reproductive age with endometriosis. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers, and websites: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Central Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) platform, from inception to 28 November 2016. We handsearched reference lists of articles retrieved by the search. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in all languages that examined effects of PRMs for treatment of symptomatic endometriosis. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Primary outcomes included measures of pain and side effects. Main results We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 960 women. Two RCTs compared mifepristone versus placebo or versus a different dose of mifepristone, one RCT compared asoprisnil versus placebo, one compared ulipristal versus leuprolide acetate, and four compared gestrinone versus danazol, gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, or a different dose of gestrinone. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. The main limitations were serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods and high or unclear rates of attrition in most studies), very serious imprecision (associated with low event rates and wide confidence intervals), and indirectness (outcome assessed in a select subgroup of participants). Mifepristone versus placebo One study made this comparison and reported rates of painful symptoms among women who reported symptoms at baseline. At three months, the mifepristone group had lower rates of dysmenorrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.17; one RCT, n =352; moderate‐quality evidence), suggesting that if 40% of women taking placebo experience dysmenorrhoea, then between 3% and 10% of women taking mifepristone will do so. The mifepristone group also had lower rates of dyspareunia (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.51; one RCT, n = 223; low‐quality evidence). However, the mifepristone group had higher rates of side effects: Nearly 90% had amenorrhoea and 24% had hot flushes, although the placebo group reported only one event of each (1%) (high‐quality evidence). Evidence was insufficient to show differences in rates of nausea, vomiting, or fatigue, if present. Mifepristone dose comparisons Two studies compared doses of mifepristone and found insufficient evidence to show differences between different doses in terms of effectiveness or safety, if present. However, subgroup analysis of comparisons between mifepristone and placebo suggest that the 2.5 mg dose may be less effective than 5 mg or 10 mg for treating dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia. Gestrinone comparisons Ons study compared gestrinone with danazol, and another study compared gestrinone with leuprolin. Evidence was insufficient to show differences, if present, between gestrinone and danazol in rate of pain relief (those reporting no or mild pelvic pain) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.56; two RCTs, n = 230; very low‐quality evidence), dysmenorrhoea (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.33; two RCTs, n = 214; very low‐quality evidence), or dyspareunia (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.86; two RCTs, n = 222; very low‐quality evidence). The gestrinone group had a higher rate of hirsutism (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.60 to 4.32; two RCTs, n = 302; very low‐quality evidence) and a lower rate of decreased breast size (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.98; two RCTs, n = 302; low‐quality evidence). Evidence was insufficient to show differences between groups, if present, in rate of hot flushes (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.26; two RCTs, n = 302; very low‐quality evidence) or acne (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.33; two RCTs, n = 302; low‐quality evidence). When researchers compared gestrinone versus leuprolin through measurements on the 1 to 3 verbal rating scale (lower score denotes benefit), the mean dysmenorrhoea score was higher in the gestrinone group (MD 0.35 points, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.58; one RCT, n = 55; low‐quality evidence), but the mean dyspareunia score was lower in this group (MD 0.33 points, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.04; low‐quality evidence). The gestrinone group had lower rates of amenorrhoea (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38; one RCT, n = 49; low‐quality evidence) and hot flushes (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.63; one study, n = 55; low quality evidence) but higher rates of spotting or bleeding (OR 22.92, 95% CI 2.64 to 198.66; one RCT, n = 49; low‐quality evidence). Evidence was insufficient to show differences in effectiveness or safety between different doses of gestrinone, if present. Asoprisnil versus placebo One study (n = 130) made this comparison but did not report data suitable for analysis. Ulipristal versus leuprolide acetate One study (n = 38) made this comparison but did not report data suitable for analysis. Authors' conclusions Among women with endometriosis, moderate‐quality evidence shows that mifepristone relieves dysmenorrhoea, and low‐quality evidence suggests that this agent relieves dyspareunia, although amenorrhoea and hot flushes are common side effects. Data on dosage were inconclusive, although they suggest that the 2.5 mg dose of mifepristone may be less effective than higher doses. We found insufficient evidence to permit firm conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of other progesterone receptor modulators.","Progesterone receptor modulators for endometriosis Review question Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed evidence on the effectiveness and safety of progesterone receptor modulators for women with endometriosis. Background Endometriosis is a disease of endometrial tissue (glands and stroma) outside the uterine cavity. It is oestrogen‐dependent and thus is seen primarily during the reproductive years. It can cause pain in the abdomen, generally during periods (menstruation) or associated with sexual intercourse. Progesterone receptor modulators have been advocated as one of the hormonal treatments for endometriosis. Study characteristics We found 10 randomised controlled trials including 960 women; the evidence is current to November 2016. Key results Three studies assessed mifepristone. Moderate‐quality evidence shows that mifepristone relieves dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) in women with endometriosis. Evidence suggests that if 40% of women taking placebo experience dysmenorrhoea, then between 3% and 10% of women taking mifepristone will do so. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mifepristone also relieves dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse). However, amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual periods) and hot flushes were common side effects of mifepristone. Nearly 90% of the mifepristone group had amenorrhoea, and 24% had hot flushes, although researchers reported only one event of each (1%) among women taking placebo. Evidence was insufficient to show differences in rates of nausea, vomiting, or fatigue, if present. Comparisons of different doses of mifepristone were inconclusive, although evidence suggests that the 2.5 mg dose may be less effective than higher doses. Other studies assessed other progesterone receptor modulators. Researchers compared gestrinone versus other treatments (danazol or leuprolin), ulipristal versus leuprolide acetate, and asoprisnil verus placebo. However, evidence was insufficient to allow firm conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of these interventions. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations were serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods and high or unclear rates of attrition in most studies), very serious imprecision (associated with low event rates and wide confidence intervals), and indirectness (outcome assessed in a select subgroup of participants).",CD009881
"Background Urinary incontinence is a common and potentially debilitating problem. Stress urinary, incontinence as the most common type of incontinence, imposes significant health and economic burdens on society and the women affected. Open retropubic colposuspension is a surgical treatment which involves lifting the tissues near the bladder neck and proximal urethra in the area behind the anterior pubic bones to correct deficient urethral closure to correct stress urinary incontinence. Objectives The review aimed to determine the effects of open retropubic colposuspension for the treatment of urinary incontinence in women. A secondary aim was to assess the safety of open retropubic colposuspension in terms of adverse events caused by the procedure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 May 2015), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted investigators to locate extra studies. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in women with symptoms or urodynamic diagnoses of stress or mixed urinary incontinence that included open retropubic colposuspension surgery in at least one trial group. Data collection and analysis Studies were evaluated for methodological quality or susceptibility to bias and appropriateness for inclusion and data extracted by two of the review authors. Trial data were analysed by intervention. Where appropriate, a summary statistic was calculated. Main results This review included 55 trials involving a total of 5417 women. Overall cure rates were 68.9% to 88.0% for open retropubic colposuspension. Two small studies suggested lower incontinence rates after open retropubic colposuspension compared with conservative treatment. Similarly, one trial suggested lower incontinence rates after open retropubic colposuspension compared to anticholinergic treatment. Evidence from six trials showed a lower incontinence rate after open retropubic colposuspension than after anterior colporrhaphy. Such benefit was maintained over time (risk ratio (RR) for incontinence 0.46; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72 before the first year, RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.51 at one to five years, RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.75 in periods beyond five years). Evidence from 22 trials in comparison with suburethral slings (traditional slings or trans‐vaginal tape or transobturator tape) found no overall significant difference in incontinence rates in all time periods evaluated (as assessed subjectively RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.18, within one year of treatment, RR 1.18; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.39 between one and five years, RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27 at five years and more, and as assessed objectively RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67 within one year of treatment, RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54 for one to five years follow up, RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.64 at more than five years). However, subgroup analysis of studies comparing traditional slings and open colposuspension showed better effectiveness with traditional slings in the medium and long term (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64 from one to five years follow up, RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). In comparison with needle suspension, there was a lower incontinence rate after colposuspension in the first year after surgery (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03), after the first year (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81), and beyond five years (RR 0.32; 95% CI 15 to 0.71). Patient‐reported incontinence rates at short, medium and long‐term follow‐up showed no significant differences between open and laparoscopic retropubic colposuspension, but with wide confidence intervals. In two trials incontinence was less common after the Burch (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76) than after the Marshall Marchetti Krantz procedure at one to five year follow‐up. There were few data at any other follow‐up times. In general, the evidence available does not show a higher morbidity or complication rate with open retropubic colposuspension compared to the other open surgical techniques, although pelvic organ prolapse is more common than after anterior colporrhaphy and sling procedures. Voiding problems are also more common after sling procedures compared to open colposuspension. Authors' conclusions Open retropubic colposuspension is an effective treatment modality for stress urinary incontinence especially in the long term. Within the first year of treatment, the overall continence rate is approximately 85% to 90%. After five years, approximately 70% of women can expect to be dry. Newer minimal access sling procedures look promising in comparison with open colposuspension but their long‐term performance is limited and closer monitoring of their adverse event profile must be carried out. Open colposuspension is associated with a higher risk of pelvic organ prolapse compared to sling operations and anterior colporrhaphy, but with a lower risk of voiding dysfunction compared to traditional sling surgery. Laparoscopic colposuspension should allow speedier recovery but its relative safety and long‐term effectiveness is not yet known. A Brief Economic Commentary (BEC) identified five studies suggesting that tension‐free vaginal tape (TVT) and laparoscopic colposuspension may be more cost‐effective compared with open retropubic colposuspension.","Open retropubic colposuspension for urinary incontinence in women Importance of the Review / Background Stress urinary incontinence is losing urine when coughing, laughing, sneezing or exercising. It can be caused by changes to muscles and ligaments holding up the bladder. Mixed urinary incontinence is also losing urine when there is an urge to void as well as when coughing and laughing. Muscle‐strengthening exercises can help, and there are surgical procedures to improve support or correct problems. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence. Open retropubic colposuspension is an operation which involves lifting the tissues around the junction between the bladder and the urethra. Main Findings The review of trials found that this is an effective surgical technique for stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women, resulting in long‐term cure for most women. It provides better cure rates compared to anterior colporrhaphy a (suturing of the top wall of the vagina) and needle suspension surgery (passing a needle with sutures at the sides of the urethra to lift up the tissues beside it).New techniques, particularly sling operations (including the use of tapes to lift up the urethra)and keyhole (laparoscopic) colposuspension, look promising but need further research particularly on long‐term performance. Procedures involving surgery to insert a tape under the urethra showed better cure rates in the medium and long term, compared to open colposuspension. In terms of costs, a non‐systematic review of economic studies suggested that open retropubic colposuspension would be cheaper than laparoscopic colposuspension, but more expensive than tension‐free vaginal tape (TVT). Adverse Events Laparoscopic colposuspension allows for faster recovery compared to open colposuspension. Studies did not reveal a higher complication rate with open colposuspension compared with the other surgical techniques, although pelvic organ prolapse was found to be more common. Abnormal voiding was less common after open colposuspension compared to sling surgery. Limitations Limited information was available on the long term adverse events of open colposuspension and its effect on the quality of life.",CD002912
"Background Histologic assessment of mucosal disease activity has been increasingly used in clinical trials of treatment for Crohn's disease. However, the operating properties of the currently existing histologic scoring indices remain unclear. Objectives A systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the development and operating characteristics of available histologic disease activity indices in Crohn's disease. Search methods Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases from inception to 20 July 2016 were supplemented by manual reviews of bibliographies and abstracts submitted to major gastroenterology meetings (Digestive Disease Week, United European Gastroenterology Week, European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation). Selection criteria Any study design (e.g. randomised controlled trial, cohort study, case series) that evaluated a histologic disease activity index in patients with Crohn’s disease was considered for inclusion. Study participants included adult patients ( >  16 years), diagnosed with Crohn’s disease using conventional clinical, radiographic or endoscopic criteria. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies identified from the literature search. The full text of potentially relevant citations were reviewed for inclusion and the study investigators were contacted as needed for clarification. Any disagreements regarding study eligibility were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author. Two authors independently extracted and recorded data using a standard form. The following data were recorded from each eligible study: number of patients enrolled; number of patients per treatment arm; patient characteristics: age and gender distribution; description of histologic disease activity index utilized; and outcomes such as content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, responsiveness, intra‐rater reliability, inter‐rater reliability, and feasibility. Main results Sixteen reports of 14 studies describing 14 different numerical histological indices fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Inter‐rater reliability was assessed in one study. For the Naini and Cortina Score, estimates of correlation were 'almost perfect', ranging from r = 0.94 to 0.96. The methodological quality of this study with respect to reliability was 'good'. With respect to validity, correlation estimates between various histological scoring systems and Crohn's disease activity as measured by objective markers of inflammation (including C‐reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin); endoscopic disease activity scores; clinical disease activity scores; and quality of life questionnaires were reported. Comparisons between histologic scoring indices and endoscopic scoring indices ranged from no correlation to 'substantial' (r = 0.779). The methodological quality of the studies that explored validity ranged form 'poor' to 'good'. Responsiveness data were available in seven studies. After subjects were administered a treatment of known efficacy, statistically significant change in the index score was demonstrated in five studies with respect to six indices. Two studies failed to indicate whether there was statistically significant change in the index score post‐treatment. With regard to methodological quality, six of the studies were rated as 'poor' and one of the studies was rated as 'fair'. Feasibility was assessed by one study. The Naini and Cortina Score was shown to be simple to use and feasible for every given case. Authors' conclusions Currently there is no fully validated histological scoring index for evaluation of Crohn's disease activity. Development of a validated histological scoring index for Crohn’s disease is a clinical and research priority.","Histologic measurement tools for evaluation of disease activity in Crohn’s disease What is Crohn's disease? Crohn’s disease is a life‐long (chronic), inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain (cramping), rectal bleeding, diarrhoea, weight loss, and tiredness. The disease has a changing course with periods of symptoms (called 'active' disease or relapse) and periods without symptoms (called 'remission'). What is a histological scoring index? A histological scoring index measures disease activity based on the examination of biopsy specimens from the bowel (small pieces of tissue removed from the bowel) under a microscope. Biopsy specimens are removed from the bowel during colonoscopy (a non‐surgical procedure used to view the digestive tract using a camera) with biopsy forceps (instruments to grasp and remove pieces of tissue). Biopsies are then processed and assessed under microscope by a pathologist (a physician who interprets and diagnoses the changes caused by disease in tissues) who then rates disease activity using the index. What did the researchers investigate? It is important that histological scoring indices measure what they are supposed to measure (validity); that they detect change after treatment (responsiveness); that the scores are consistently reproducible (reliability); and that they can be easily utilized (feasibility). The researchers investigated whether studies have assessed the validity, responsiveness, reliability and feasibility of histological scoring indices. What did the researcher find? The researchers found that none of the existing histological scoring indices have been fully validated.",CD012351
"Background Extravasation injury, a complication commonly seen in the neonatal intensive care unit, can result in scarring with cosmetic and functional sequelae. A wide variety of treatments are available, including subcutaneous irrigation with saline (with or without hyaluronidase), liposuction, use of specific antidotes, topical applications, and normal wound care with dry or wet dressings. All such treatments aim to prevent or reduce the severity of complications. Objectives Primary objective To compare the efficacy and safety of saline irrigation or saline irrigation with prior hyaluronidase infiltration versus no intervention or normal wound care for tissue healing in neonates with extravasation injury. Secondary objectives To evaluate by subgroup analysis of controlled trials the influence of type of extravasate, timing of irrigation following extravasation, and postmenstrual age (PMA) of the neonate at the time of injury on outcomes and adverse effects. Specifically, we planned to perform subgroup analysis for the primary outcome, if appropriate, by examining: 1. time to irrigation from identified extravasation injury (< 1 hour or ≥ 1 hour); 2. type of extravasate (parenteral nutrition fluid or other fluids or medications); 3. amount of saline used (< 500 mL or ≥ 500 mL); and 4. PMA at injury (< 37 completed weeks or ≥ 37 completed weeks). Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 2 February 2017), Embase (1980 to 2 February 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 2 February 2017). We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. We used the Google Scholar search tool for reverse citations of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing saline irrigation with or without hyaluronidase infiltration versus no intervention or normal wound care for the management of extravasation injury in neonates. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently reviewed and identified articles for possible inclusion in this review. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. Main results We found no eligible studies. Our search revealed 10 case reports or case series describing successful outcomes with different interventions for this condition. Authors' conclusions To date, no RCTs have examined the effects of saline irrigation with or without prior hyaluronidase infiltration for management of extravasation injury in neonates. Saline irrigation is frequently reported in the literature as an intervention for management of extravasation injury in neonates. Research should focus first on evaluating the efficacy and safety of this intervention through RCTs. It will also be important for investigators to determine effect size by examining the timing of the intervention, the nature of the infusate, and severity of injury at the time of intervention.","Saline irrigation for the management of skin extravasation injury in neonates Review question:  How does saline irrigation or saline irrigation with prior hyaluronidase compare with no intervention or normal wound care for improving tissue healing in neonates with extravasation injury? Background:  Preterm and sick term infants requiring intravenous fluids and medications are vulnerable to tissue injury secondary to extravasation, that is, leakage of fluid into surrounding tissue. Such injury can result in scarring with consequent cosmetic issues and, in some infants, functional limitations. Remedial surgical intervention may be required for some babies. Saline flush, with or without prior infiltration of hyaluronidase (a protein that promotes the breakdown of barriers that hold tissue planes together), is widely used for the management of severe extravasation injury in neonates, and is intended to prevent or reduce complications following extravasation. Conservative treatment with normal wound care and various topical dressings is commonly used at different stages of extravasation injury with variable results. Study characteristics:  We found no high‐quality randomised or quasi‐randomised studies that currently answer this question. Key results:  To date, no randomised controlled trials have examined the effects of saline irrigation with or without prior hyaluronidase infiltration on the management of extravasation injury in neonates. Frequent reports in the literature indicate that saline irrigation is used for the management of extravasation injury in neonates. Research should be directed first toward evaluating the efficacy and safety of this intervention through randomised controlled trials. It will also be important to determine effect size by examining the timing of the intervention, the nature of the infusate, and severity of injury at the time of intervention. Quality of evidence:  We obtained very low‐quality evidence from case series or reports.",CD008404
"Background This is the second update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2009. Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time‐series (ITS) of non‐clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance. Main results We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12‐year time‐series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). Effects on noise exposure Engineering interventions following legislation One ITS study found that new legislation in the mining industry reduced the median personal noise exposure dose in underground coal mining by 27.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) −36.1 to −19.3 percentage points) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation. This roughly translates to a 4.5 dB(A) decrease in noise level. The intervention was associated with a favourable but statistically non‐significant downward trend in time of the noise dose of −2.1 percentage points per year (95% CI −4.9 to 0.7, 4 year follow‐up, very low‐quality evidence). Engineering intervention case studies We found 12 studies that described 107 uncontrolled case studies of immediate reductions in noise levels of machinery ranging from 11.1 to 19.7 dB(A) as a result of purchasing new equipment, segregating noise sources or installing panels or curtains around sources. However, the studies lacked long‐term follow‐up and dose measurements of workers, and we did not use these studies for our conclusions. Hearing protection devices In general hearing protection devices reduced noise exposure on average by about 20 dB(A) in one RCT and three CBAs (57 participants, low‐quality evidence). Two RCTs showed that, with instructions for insertion, the attenuation of noise by earplugs was 8.59 dB better (95% CI 6.92 dB to 10.25 dB) compared to no instruction (2 RCTs, 140 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). Administrative controls: information and noise exposure feedback On‐site training sessions did not have an effect on personal noise‐exposure levels compared to information only in one cluster‐RCT after four months' follow‐up (mean difference (MD) 0.14 dB; 95% CI −2.66 to 2.38). Another arm of the same study found that personal noise exposure information had no effect on noise levels (MD 0.30 dB(A), 95% CI −2.31 to 2.91) compared to no such information (176 participants, low‐quality evidence). Effects on hearing loss Hearing protection devices In two studies the authors compared the effect of different devices on temporary threshold shifts at short‐term follow‐up but reported insufficient data for analysis. In two CBA studies the authors found no difference in hearing loss from noise exposure above 89 dB(A) between muffs and earplugs at long‐term follow‐up (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03 ), very low‐quality evidence). Authors of another CBA study found that wearing hearing protection more often resulted in less hearing loss at very long‐term follow‐up (very low‐quality evidence). Combination of interventions: hearing loss prevention programmes One cluster‐RCT found no difference in hearing loss at three‐ or 16‐year follow‐up between an intensive HLPP for agricultural students and audiometry only. One CBA study found no reduction of the rate of hearing loss (MD −0.82 dB per year (95% CI −1.86 to 0.22) for a HLPP that provided regular personal noise exposure information compared to a programme without this information. There was very‐low‐quality evidence in four very long‐term studies, that better use of hearing protection devices as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69). Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect. In three long‐term CBA studies, workers in a HLPP had a statistically non‐significant 1.8 dB (95% CI −0.6 to 4.2 )  greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than non‐exposed workers and the confidence interval includes the 4.2 dB which is the level of hearing loss resulting from 5 years of exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, of three other CBA studies that could not be included in the meta‐analysis, two showed an increased risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non‐exposed workers and one CBA did not. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate‐quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short‐term follow‐up but long‐term follow‐up is still needed. There is very low‐quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. Rather, it means that further research is very likely to have an important impact.","Interventions to prevent hearing loss caused by noise at work What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if hearing loss caused by noise at work can be prevented. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. They found 29 studies that studied the effect of preventive measures. Key messages Stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. At the personal level, earmuffs and earplugs can reduce noise exposure to safe levels. However, instruction on how to put plugs into the ears is needed. Without instruction earplugs probably do not protect enough. Providing feedback to workers on noise exposure probably does not decrease noise. Engineering solutions such as better maintenance might lead to similar noise reduction as hearing protection. Better evaluation of these engineering solutions is needed. The effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPP) are unclear. Better use of hearing protection as part of a programme probably helps but does not fully protect against hearing loss. Improved implementation might provide better protection. What was studied in the review? Millions of workers are exposed to noise that can lead to hearing loss. The review authors were interested in the effect of any intervention to reduce noise or hearing loss at workplaces, such as engineering solutions, hearing protection or hearing loss prevention programmes. What are the results of the review? Effects on noise exposure Engineering solutions We found one study that showed that noise levels decreased by about 5 decibels (dB) after the implementation of stricter legislation in the mining industry. Even though many case studies show that technical improvements can reduce noise levels at workplaces by as much as 20 dB, there were no controlled studies outside the laboratory that would show this with more confidence. Hearing protection In eight studies with 358 workers, hearing protection reduced noise exposure of workers by about 20 dB(A). However, for earplugs there was moderate‐quality evidence in two randomised studies that if workers lack proper instructions in the use of earplugs, the attenuation offered is reduced by on average 9 dB.  Feedback on noise exposure Providing feedback on noise exposure did not change noise levels in the construction industry in one study. Effects on hearing loss We found 16 studies with 81,220 participants on the long‐term effects of hearing protection on hearing loss. Hearing protection The use of hearing protection devices in a well‐implemented HLPP was associated with less hearing loss. For other elements of programmes such as worker training, audiometry alone, noise monitoring, or providing feedback on personal noise exposure, there was no clear effect. Two studies with 3242 workers found that there was no difference in the long‐term effect of earmuffs versus earplugs on hearing loss. Hearing loss prevention programmes Four studies provided very low‐quality evidence that, compared to non‐exposed workers, average HLPPs do not reduce the risk of hearing loss to below a level at least equivalent to that of workers who are exposed to 85 dB(A). Two comparable additional studies showed that the risk of hearing loss is still substantial despite being covered by a HLPP. However, one low‐quality study showed that a stricter HLPP can protect workers from hearing loss. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. Rather, it means that further research is very likely to affect the conclusions we reached. Higher‐quality prevention programmes, better quality of studies, especially in the field of engineering controls, and better implementation of legislation are needed to prevent noise‐induced hearing loss.

"Background Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease‐modulating dressings. Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. This review is a network meta‐analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. Objectives To assess the effects of dressings and topical agents for healing pressure ulcers in any care setting. We aimed to examine this evidence base as a whole, determining probabilities that each treatment is the best, with full assessment of uncertainty and evidence quality. Search methods In July 2016 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses, guidelines and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of at least one of the following interventions with any other intervention in the treatment of pressure ulcers (Stage 2 or above): any dressing, or any topical agent applied directly to an open pressure ulcer and left in situ. We excluded from this review dressings attached to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, skin grafts, growth factor treatments, platelet gels and larval therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We conducted network meta‐analysis using frequentist mega‐regression methods for the efficacy outcome, probability of complete healing. We modelled the relative effectiveness of any two treatments as a function of each treatment relative to the reference treatment (saline gauze). We assumed that treatment effects were similar within dressings classes (e.g. hydrocolloid, foam). We present estimates of effect with their 95% confidence intervals for individual treatments compared with every other, and we report ranking probabilities for each intervention (probability of being the best, second best, etc treatment). We assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of evidence using GRADE for each network comparison and for the network as whole. Main results We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. The consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. We have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low‐certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. We present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole. It is not clear whether regimens involving protease‐modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate‐certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). This risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% CI 13 fewer to 302 more). It is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low‐certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. Authors' conclusions A network meta‐analysis (NMA) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). Consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze. More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. The NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Which dressings or topical agents are the most effective for healing pressure ulcers? Dressings and topical agents for treating pressure ulcers Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of dressings and topical agents (such as ointments, creams and gels) on pressure ulcer healing. There are many different dressings and topical agents available, and we wanted to find out which were the most effective. Background Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are wounds involving the skin and sometimes the tissue that lies underneath. Pressure ulcers can be painful, may become infected and affect people's quality of life. People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include those with limited mobility ‐ such as older people and people with short‐term or long‐term medical conditions ‐ and people with spinal cord injuries. In 2004 the total yearly cost of treating pressure ulcers in the UK was estimated as being GBP 1.4 to 2.1 billion, which was equivalent to 4% of the total National Health Service expenditure. Topical agents such as ointments, creams or gels are applied to unhealed pressure ulcers and left in place to treat the wound; they may be covered with a dressing. Some of these treatments have been compared with each other in trials, usually comparing two treatments at a time. We used a method called 'network meta‐analysis' to bring together all the trial results of different treatments in a reliable way. We hoped that this method, which compares all treatment options, would help us find out which was the best treatment for healing pressure ulcers. Study characteristics In July 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials looking at dressings and topical agents for treating pressure ulcers and that gave results for complete wound healing. We found 51 studies involving a total of 2947 people. Thirty‐nine of these studies, involving 2127 people, gave results we could bring together in a network meta‐analysis comparing 21 different treatments. Most participants in the trials were older people; three of the 39 trials involved participants with spinal cord injuries. Key results Generally, the studies we found did not have many participants and results were often inconclusive. This problem carried over into the network meta‐analysis and made the findings unclear. As a result, it was unclear whether one topical agent or dressing was better than another. Some findings for individual comparisons may be slightly more reliable. Protease‐modulating dressings, foam dressings or collagenase ointment may be better at healing than gauze; but even this evidence is not certain enough to be an adequate guide for treatment choices. Certainty of the evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low or low. The next step might be to do more research of better quality to see which dressings or topical agents could best heal pressure ulcers. This plain language summary is up to date as of July 2016.",CD011947
"Background Child and adolescent overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short‐ and long‐term health consequences. This is an update of a Cochrane review published first in 2003, and updated previously in 2009. However, the update has now been split into six reviews addressing different childhood obesity treatments at different ages. Objectives To assess the effects of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions (behaviour‐changing interventions) for the treatment of overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We checked references of studies and systematic reviews. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last search was July 2016 for all databases. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions (behaviour‐changing interventions) for treating overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years, with a minimum of six months' follow‐up. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened references, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information. We carried out meta‐analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Main results We included 70 RCTs with a total of 8461 participants randomised to either the intervention or control groups. The number of participants per trial ranged from 16 to 686. Fifty‐five trials compared a behaviour‐changing intervention with no treatment/usual care control and 15 evaluated the effectiveness of adding an additional component to a behaviour‐changing intervention. Sixty‐four trials were parallel RCTs, and four were cluster RCTs. Sixty‐four trials were multicomponent, two were diet only and four were physical activity only interventions. Ten trials had more than two arms. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low and 62 trials had a high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Total duration of trials ranged from six months to three years. The median age of participants was 10 years old and the median BMI z score was 2.2. Primary analyses demonstrated that behaviour‐changing interventions compared to no treatment/usual care control at longest follow‐up reduced BMI, BMI z score and weight. Mean difference (MD) in BMI was ‐0.53 kg/m 2  (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.82 to ‐0.24); P < 0.00001; 24 trials; 2785 participants; low‐quality evidence. MD in BMI z score was ‐0.06 units (95% CI ‐0.10 to ‐0.02); P = 0.001; 37 trials; 4019 participants; low‐quality evidence and MD in weight was ‐1.45 kg (95% CI ‐1.88 to ‐1.02); P < 0.00001; 17 trials; 1774 participants; low‐quality evidence. Thirty‐one trials reported on serious adverse events, with 29 trials reporting zero occurrences RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.93); P = 0.37; 4/2105 participants in the behaviour‐changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). Few trials reported health‐related quality of life or behaviour change outcomes, and none of the analyses demonstrated a substantial difference in these outcomes between intervention and control. In two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI ‐12.88 to ‐0.31), P = 0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the intervention. No trials reported on all‐cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none of which could be meta‐analysed. As the meta‐analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of comparator, type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting, duration of post‐intervention follow‐up period, parental involvement and baseline BMI z score. No subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on any of the outcomes. Some data indicated that a reduction in BMI immediately post‐intervention was no longer evident at follow‐up at less than six months, which has to be investigated in further trials. Authors' conclusions Multi‐component behaviour‐changing interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change may be beneficial in achieving small, short‐term reductions in BMI, BMI z score and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. The evidence suggests a very low occurrence of adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The heterogeneity observed across all outcomes was not explained by subgrouping. Further research is required of behaviour‐changing interventions in lower income countries and in children from different ethnic groups; also on the impact of behaviour‐changing interventions on health‐related quality of life and comorbidities. The sustainability of reduction in BMI/BMI z score and weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer‐term follow‐up and further research on the most appropriate forms of post‐intervention maintenance in order to ensure intervention benefits are sustained over the longer term.","Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years Review question How effective are diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years? Background Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems, both while as children and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem. Study characteristics We found 70 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments to a variety of control groups delivered to 8461 overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years. We reported on the effects of 64 multicomponent interventions (different combinations of diet and physical activity and behaviour change), four physical activity interventions and two dietary interventions compared with no intervention, 'usual care’ or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were followed up between six months and three years. Key results The average age of the children was 10 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex and age, weight, and height changes as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 37 trials in 4019 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.06 units lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 24 trials in 2785 children reporting BMI, which on average was 0.53 kg/m 2  lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 17 trials in 1774 children reporting weight, which on average was 1.45 kg lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health‐related quality of life were less clear. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity or socioeconomic effects. Serious adverse events were rare: only two of 31 trials with data reported any serious adverse events (4/2105 participants in the behaviour‐changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). This evidence is up to date as of July 2016. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because of limited confidence in how studies were performed, and the results were inconsistent between the studies. Also there were just a few studies for some outcomes, with small numbers of included children.",CD012651
"Background Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for people with fibromyalgia that will replace the ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"" review first published in 2002. Objectives • To evaluate the benefits and harms of aerobic exercise training for adults with fibromyalgia • To assess the following specific comparisons  ० Aerobic versus control conditions (eg, treatment as usual, wait list control, physical activity as usual)  ० Aerobic versus aerobic interventions (eg, running vs brisk walking)  ० Aerobic versus non‐exercise interventions (eg, medications, education)    We did not assess specific comparisons involving aerobic exercise versus other exercise interventions (eg, resistance exercise, aquatic exercise, flexibility exercise, mixed exercise). Other systematic reviews have examined or will examine these comparisons (Bidonde 2014; Busch 2013). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Thesis and Dissertation Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry up to June 2016, unrestricted by language, and we reviewed the reference lists of retrieved trials to identify potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared aerobic training interventions (dynamic physical activity that increases breathing and heart rate to submaximal levels for a prolonged period) versus no exercise or another intervention. Major outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQL), pain intensity, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed a risk of bias assessment, and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. We used a 15% threshold for calculation of clinically relevant differences between groups. Main results We included 13 RCTs (839 people). Studies were at risk of selection, performance, and detection bias (owing to lack of blinding for self‐reported outcomes) and had low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We prioritized the findings when aerobic exercise was compared with no exercise control and present them fully here. Eight trials (with 456 participants) provided low‐quality evidence for pain intensity, fatigue, stiffness, and physical function; and moderate‐quality evidence for withdrawals and HRQL at completion of the intervention (6 to 24 weeks). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self‐reported and were expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs)/standardized mean differences (SMDs) indicate improvement). Effects for aerobic exercise versus control were as follows: HRQL: mean 56.08; five studies; N = 372; MD ‐7.89, 95% CI ‐13.23 to ‐2.55; absolute improvement of 8% (3% to 13%) and relative improvement of 15% (5% to 24%); pain intensity: mean 65.31; six studies; N = 351; MD ‐11.06, 95% CI ‐18.34 to ‐3.77; absolute improvement of 11% (95% CI 4% to 18%) and relative improvement of 18% (7% to 30%); stiffness: mean 69; one study; N = 143; MD ‐7.96, 95% CI ‐14.95 to ‐0.97; absolute difference in improvement of 8% (1% to 15%) and relative change in improvement of 11.4% (21.4% to 1.4%); physical function: mean 38.32; three studies; N = 246; MD ‐10.16, 95% CI ‐15.39 to ‐4.94; absolute change in improvement of 10% (15% to 5%) and relative change in improvement of 21.9% (33% to 11%); and fatigue: mean 68; three studies; N = 286; MD ‐6.48, 95% CI ‐14.33 to 1.38; absolute change in improvement of 6% (12% improvement to 0.3% worse) and relative change in improvement of 8% (16% improvement to 0.4% worse). Pooled analysis resulted in a risk ratio (RR) of moderate quality for withdrawals (17 per 100 and 20 per 100 in control and intervention groups, respectively; eight studies; N = 456; RR 1.25, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.77; absolute change of 5% more withdrawals with exercise (3% fewer to 12% more). Three trials provided low‐quality evidence on long‐term effects (24 to 208 weeks post intervention) and reported that benefits for pain and function persisted but did not for HRQL or fatigue. Withdrawals were similar, and investigators did not assess stiffness and adverse events. We are uncertain about the effects of one aerobic intervention versus another, as the evidence was of low to very low quality and was derived from single trials only, precluding meta‐analyses. Similarly, we are uncertain of the effects of aerobic exercise over active controls (ie, education, three studies; stress management training, one study; medication, one study) owing to evidence of low to very low quality provided by single trials. Most studies did not measure adverse events; thus we are uncertain about the risk of adverse events associated with aerobic exercise. Authors' conclusions When compared with control, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that aerobic exercise probably improves HRQL and all‐cause withdrawal, and low‐quality evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may slightly decrease pain intensity, may slightly improve physical function, and may lead to little difference in fatigue and stiffness. Three of the reported outcomes reached clinical significance (HRQL, physical function, and pain). Long‐term effects of aerobic exercise may include little or no difference in pain, physical function, and all‐cause withdrawal, and we are uncertain about long‐term effects on remaining outcomes. We downgraded the evidence owing to the small number of included trials and participants across trials, and because of issues related to unclear and high risks of bias (performance, selection, and detection biases). Aerobic exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), although evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety.","Aerobic exercise for adults with fibromyalgia This review summarizes the effects of aerobic exercise for adults with fibromyalgia. What are aerobic exercises? Aerobic exercises, such as walking and swimming, cause harder breathing and faster heart beating than occur at rest. Benefits of doing aerobic exercise include strengthening the heart and improving circulation, lowering blood pressure, and helping to control blood sugar and weight. What problems does fibromyalgia cause? People with fibromyalgia have chronic bodily pain and often have increased fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression, and problems sleeping. Study characteristics We searched for studies until June 2016, and found 13 studies (839 individuals). Most studies (61.5%) included only female participants. Average age of participants was 41 years (minimum 32 to maximum 56 years). According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, most participants were not doing exercises before starting the study. Aerobic interventions were compared with controls (wait list, treatment as usual, daily activities as usual) over six to 24 weeks. On average, exercise sessions were provided two to three times per week for 35 minutes each session. Exercises involved walking, cycling, running, and doing low‐impact aerobics and aquacise. Participants exercised at different intensities, starting light and increasing as the study progressed. All programs were supervised. Key results at the end of treatment The findings of aerobic exercise compared with no exercise control were prioritised and are presented fully here. Moderate‐quality evidence revealed that aerobic exercise improved HRQL, and low‐quality evidence showed improvement in physical function and decreased pain, fatigue, and stiffness compared with control. Similar numbers of people dropped out of the aerobic interventions group and the comparison group. Minor adverse events were reported, but reporting was inconsistent in these studies. Four studies explored long‐term effects at 24 to 208 weeks  after  the intervention ended. They reported benefits for pain and physical function among exercisers and noted no other effects. Best estimates of what happened in people with fibromyalgia when they did aerobic exercise compared with when they received control interventions Each outcome below was measured on a scale from 0 to 100, on which lower scores were better. HRQL after 12 to 24 weeks:  People who exercised were 7% better (or 7 points, ranging from 3 to 13 points) and rated their HRQL as 48 points versus 56 points in the control group. Pain after 6 to 24 weeks:  People who exercised were 11% better (or 11 points, ranging from 4 to 18 points) and rated their pain as 56 points versus 65 points in the control group. Fatigue after 14 to 24 weeks:  Those who exercised were 6% better (or 6 points, ranging from 12 better to 0.3 worse) and rated their fatigue as 63 points versus 68 points in the control group. Stiffness after 16 weeks:  Those who exercised were 8% better (or 8 points, ranging from 1 to 15) and rated their stiffness as 61 points versus 69 points in the control group. Physical function after 8 to 24 weeks:  The aerobic exercise group was 10% better (or 10 points, ranging from 15 to 5) and participants rated their physical function as 37 points versus 46 points in the control group. Other results: Withdrawal from treatment A total of 20 out of 100 people dropped out of the aerobic group compared with 17 out of 100 from the control group (3% more, ranging from 3% fewer to 12% more) for any reason. Adverse events We do not have precise information about adverse events associated with aerobic exercise. Some reports describe increased pain or fatigue, and one of the 496 participants doing aerobic exercise experienced a foot bone (metatarsal) stress fracture. This may have happened by chance. Quality of the evidence Evidence shows that aerobic exercise may improve HRQL, pain, stiffness, and physical function, and probably leads to similar numbers of people dropping out from each group. Aerobic exercise does not seem to improve fatigue. The quality of the evidence was considered to be low or moderate because of the small numbers of people included in the studies, some issues involving study design, and low certainty of results.",CD012700
"Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with a high clinical and socioeconomic burden. Treatments to alleviate the symptoms of PAD and decrease the risks of amputation and death are a high societal priority. A number of growth factors have shown a potential to stimulate angiogenesis. Growth factors delivered directly (as recombinant proteins), or indirectly (e.g. by viral vectors or DNA plasmids encoding these factors), have emerged as a promising strategy to treat patients with PAD. Objectives To assess the effects of growth factors that promote angiogenesis for treating people with PAD of the lower extremities. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (June 2016) and CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5). We searched trial registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We also checked the reference lists of relevant publications and, if necessary, tried to contact the trialists for details of the studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing growth factors (delivered directly or indirectly) with no intervention, placebo or any other intervention not based on the growth factor's action in patients with PAD of the lower extremities. The primary outcomes were limb amputation, death and adverse events. The secondary outcomes comprised walking ability, haemodynamic measures, ulceration and rest pain. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias. We used outcomes of the studies at low risk of bias for the main analysis and of all studies in the sensitivity analyses. We calculated odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated statistical heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic and Cochrane's Q test. We conducted meta‐analysis for the overall effect and for each growth factor as a subgroup analysis using OR in a fixed‐effect model. We evaluated the robustness of the results in a sensitivity analysis using risk ratio (RR) and/or a random‐effects model. We also assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 20 trials in the review and used 14 studies (on approximately 1400 participants) with published results in the analyses. Six published studies compared fibroblast growth factors (FGF), four studies hepatocyte growth factors (HGF) and another four studies vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), versus placebo or no therapy. Six of these studies exclusively or mainly investigated participants with intermittent claudication and eight studies exclusively participants with critical limb ischaemia. Follow‐up generally ranged from three months to one year. Two small studies provided some data at 2 years and one of them also at 10 years. The direction and size of effects for growth factors on major limb amputations (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.38; 10 studies, N = 1075) and death (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.41; 12 studies, N = 1371) at up to two years are uncertain. The quality of the evidence is low due to risk of bias and imprecision (at one year, moderate‐quality evidence due to imprecision). However, growth factors may decrease the rate of any limb amputations (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99; 6 studies, N = 415). The quality of the evidence is low due to risk of bias and selective reporting. The direction and size of effects for growth factors on serious adverse events (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.50; 13 studies, N = 1411) and on any adverse events (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.64; 4 studies, N = 709) at up to two years are also uncertain. The quality of the evidence is low due to risk of bias and imprecision (for serious adverse events at one year, moderate‐quality evidence due to imprecision). Growth factors may improve haemodynamic measures (low‐quality evidence), ulceration (very low‐quality evidence) and rest pain (very low‐quality evidence) up to one year, but they have little or no effect on walking ability (low‐quality evidence). We did not identify any relevant differences in effects between growth factors (FGF, HGF and VEGF). Authors' conclusions The results of this review do not support the use of therapy with the growth factors FGF, HGF or VEGF in people with PAD of the lower extremities to prevent death or major limb amputation or to improve walking ability. However, the use of these growth factors may improve haemodynamic measures and decrease the rate of any limb amputations (probably due to preventing minor amputations) with an uncertain effect on adverse events; an improvement of ulceration and rest pain is very uncertain. New trials at low risk of bias are needed to generate evidence with more certainty.","Treating people with reduced blood supply to the legs with substances stimulating new vessel formation (growth factors) Background and review question Different diseases, such as atherosclerosis, can cause reduced blood supply to the legs. Depending on the disease severity this may be associated with symptoms such as leg pain when walking or resting, ulceration (open sores) and gangrene of the leg. Reduced blood supply to the legs affects 3% to 10% of all people and 15% to 20% of people over 70 years of age. It is a major cause of decreased mobility and quality of life and of increased risks for amputation or death. The treatment strategy generally comprises behavioural changes (e.g. smoking cessation, exercise and diet), drugs (e.g. antiplatelets, statins) and catheter‐based or surgical interventions. However, for some patients the only option is leg amputation. Some substances naturally produced in the body, called growth factors, can stimulate new vessel formation. Nowadays, these substances are laboratory produced with the attempt to treat people with reduced blood supply to the legs. Therefore, we evaluated the evidence from clinical studies on the effects of growth factors in those people. Key results and implications We identified 20 studies and analysed the results of 14 published studies involving approximately 1400 patients and assessing three types of growth factors (evidence current to June 2016). Our review shows that the effects of growth factors on the most important clinical parameters comprising limb amputations above the ankle, death and adverse events are uncertain (low‐quality evidence up to two years, although moderate‐quality evidence for one year). However, the rate of all limb amputations may decrease (low‐quality evidence). In addition, growth factors may improve parameters of blood flow (low‐quality evidence), ulceration (very low‐quality evidence) and rest pain (very low‐quality evidence) at up to one year, but have little or no effect on walking ability (low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of evidence mostly due to low statistical power and poor study quality. We did not identify any relevant differences in effects between growth factors. This review does not support growth factor therapy in people with reduced blood supply to the legs to prevent limb amputations above the ankle or death or to improve walking ability. However, using growth factors may improve parameters of blood flow and prevent limb amputations below the ankle with an uncertain effect on adverse events; an improvement of ulceration and rest pain is very uncertain. New high‐quality studies are needed to generate evidence with more certainty.",CD011741
"Background Micronutrient deficiencies are common among adults living with HIV disease, particularly in low‐income settings where the diet may be low in essential vitamins and minerals. Some micronutrients play critical roles in maintenance of the immune system, and routine supplementation could therefore be beneficial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010. Objectives To assess whether micronutrient supplements are effective and safe in reducing mortality and HIV‐related morbidity of HIV‐positive adults (excluding pregnant women). Search methods We performed literature searches from January 2010 to 18 November 2016 for new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of micronutrient supplements since the previous review included all trials identified from searches prior to 2010. We searched the CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), Embase, and PubMed databases. Also we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of all new included trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs that compared supplements that contained either single, dual, or multiple micronutrients with placebo, no treatment, or other supplements. We excluded studies that were primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of HIV‐positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Primary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, morbidity, and disease progression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and appraised trial quality for risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, as hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event data, and as mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Since we were often unable to pool the outcome data, we tabulated it for each comparison. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 33 trials with 10,325 participants, of which 17 trials were new trials. Ten trials compared a daily multiple micronutrient supplement to placebo in doses up to 20 times the dietary reference intake, and one trial compared a daily standard dose with a high daily dose of multivitamins. Nineteen trials compared supplementation with single or dual micronutrients (such as vitamins A and D, zinc, and selenium) to placebo, and three trials compared different dosages or combinations of micronutrients. Multiple micronutrients We conducted analyses across antiretroviral therapy (ART)‐naive adults (3 trials, 1448 participants), adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (1 trial, 400 participants), and ART‐naive adults with concurrent active tuberculosis (3 trials, 1429 participants). Routine multiple micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in adults living with HIV (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15; 7 trials, 2897 participants,  low certainty evidence ). Routine supplementation for up to two years may have little or no effect on the average of mean CD4+ cell count (MD 26.40 cells/mm³, 95% CI −22.91 to 75.70; 6 trials, 1581 participants,  low certainty evidence ), or the average of mean viral load (MD −0.1 log 10 viral copies, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.06; 4 trials, 840 participants,  moderate certainty evidence ). One additional trial in ART‐naïve adults did report an increase in the time to reach a CD4+ cell count < 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation in Botswana (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.88; 1 trial, 439 participants). However, the trial authors reported this effect only in the trial arm that received multiple micronutrients plus selenium (not either supplementation alone), which is inconsistent with the findings of other trials that used similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium. In one additional trial that compared high‐dose multiple micronutrient supplementation with standard doses in people on ART, peripheral neuropathy was lower with high dose supplements compared to standard dose (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.94; 1 trial, 3418 participants), but the trial was stopped early due to increased adverse events (elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels) in the high dose group. Single or dual micronutrients None of the trials of single or dual micronutrient supplements were adequately powered to assess for effects on mortality or morbidity outcomes. No clinically significant changes in CD4 cell count (data not pooled, 14 trials, 2370 participants,  very low or low certainty evidence ) or viral load (data not pooled, seven studies, 1334 participants,  very low or low certainty evidence ), were reported. Supplementation probably does increase blood concentrations of vitamin D and zinc (data not pooled, vitamin D: 4 trials, 299 participants, zinc: 4 trials, 484 participants,  moderate certainty evidence ) and may also increase blood concentrations of vitamin A (data not pooled, 3 trials, 495 participants,  low certainty evidence ), especially in those who are deficient. Authors' conclusions The analyses of the available trials have not revealed consistent clinically important benefits with routine multiple micronutrient supplementation in people living with HIV. Larger trials might reveal small but important effects. These findings should not be interpreted as a reason to deny micronutrient supplements for people living with HIV where specific deficiencies are found or where the person's diet is insufficient to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. 12 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (18 Nov, 2016) were included and six ongoing studies have been identified (see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' section)","Micronutrient supplements for non‐pregnant adults with HIV infection Cochrane researchers conducted a review of the effects of micronutrient supplements for people living with HIV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010. After searching for relevant trials up to 18 November 2016, the review authors included 33 trials. Thirteen of these trials included people not on HIV treatment and were conducted in Thailand, Peru, and eight African countries. Nineteen trials included people on HIV treatment and were conducted in North America, Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Thailand, Botswana, and Uganda. One trial from China did not state whether people living with HIV were on treatment or not. Some trials looked at the effects of taking supplements with multiple micronutrients whereas others looked at supplementation with single vitamins or minerals. What are micronutrient supplements and how might they help people living with HIV? Micronutrient supplements contain vitamins or minerals, or both, that are essential to good health. Many of these vitamins play important roles in maintaining the human immune system, which helps to fight off infections. Infection with HIV causes a progressive destruction of the immune system, which leaves people vulnerable to frequent infections. Many people living with HIV, especially in low‐income countries, are also undernourished and many consume diets deficient that these essential micronutrients. Supplementation could therefore help people living with HIV to stay healthy for longer by strengthening their immune system or assisting recovery from infections. What the research says Multiple micronutrients Providing a daily supplement that contains multiple vitamins and minerals may have little or no effect on reducing deaths in people living with HIV, whether they are taking antiretroviral drugs or not ( low certainty evidence ). Daily supplements may have little or no effect on HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count ( low certainty evidence ) or HIV viral load ( low or moderate certainty evidence ). Single or dual micronutrients We do not know whether supplements that contain single vitamins or minerals reduce deaths ( very low certainty evidence ) or slow disease progression ( very low/low certainty evidence ) in people living with HIV. Supplementation with vitamin A, D, zinc, or selenium may improve the level of each vitamin in a person's blood, especially those with low levels before supplementation ( low/moderate certainty evidence ). These findings do not mean that an adequate dietary intake for people living with HIV is not important. It is also not a reason to deny micronutrient supplements for those in whom a deficiency has been clinically demonstrated, or who are unlikely to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals.",CD003650
"Background Focal abnormalities most commonly acquired within the uterine cavity include endometrial polyps (arising from the endometrium) and submucous fibroids (arising from the myometrium). These benign abnormalities can cause several problems, including abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and subfertility. Two‐dimensional saline infusion sonography (2D SIS) is a minimally invasive test that can be used to diagnose these pathologies, but it is less accurate than hysteroscopy, which is a more invasive procedure by which an endoscope allows direct visualisation of the uterine cavity. Three‐dimensional (3D) SIS appears to enhance sonographic visualisation within the uterine cavity, thereby offering a potentially more accurate minimally invasive diagnostic test. Objectives Primary objectives • To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test . • To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test .  In this case, any abnormality on either modality was regarded as a positive result (‘OR’ approach). Secondary objectives • To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference. • To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference. Search methods We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register and CGFG Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Screening reference lists of appropriate studies was also performed. We screened for eligibility all studies identified from inception until March 2016. We performed searches with no date or language restrictions. Selection criteria The population of interest consisted of premenopausal women with AUB or subfertility and postmenopausal women with AUB. Diagnostic test accuracy studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the accuracy of both 2D SIS and 3D SIS for the diagnosis of acquired intracavitary abnormalities with hysteroscopy used as the reference standard. In light of the lack of data for 3D SIS, we also included studies that evaluated the accuracy of 3D SIS alone. Data collection and analysis Two review authors read all potentially eligible references after performing a first screening by title and abstract (LLN and FJRH). They independently extracted data to construct 2×2 tables from eligible studies and assessed studies for methodological quality using the QUADAS‐2 tool (revised tool for quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies). To describe and visually present results, we produced in RevMan forest plots showing pairs of sensitivity and specificity together with 95% confidence intervals from each study, as well as raw receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. We displayed paired analyses in an ROC plot by linking sensitivity‐specificity pairs from each study by using a dashed line. To compare 3D SIS versus 2D SIS, we restricted analyses to studies that provided 2×2 tables for both tests and used the bivariate meta‐analysis of sensitivity and specificity. Main results Thirteen studies (1053 women) reported the accuracy of 3D SIS for focal uterine abnormalities; 11 of these (846 women) were suitable for meta‐analysis, and eight reported accuracy according to the type of focal abnormality. The design of the included studies seems applicable. The main problem involving the quality of included studies is insufficient reporting of study methods, resulting in unclear risk of bias for several of the quality domains assessed. Therefore, we considered the overall quality of the evidence as low. The summary estimate (11 studies reporting absence or presence of abnormality at 3D SIS) for sensitivity was 94.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.6% to 96.9%) and for specificity 99.4% (95% CI 96.2% to 99.9%). Meta‐analysis of the eight studies (N = 716) directly comparing 2D SIS versus 3D SIS showed summary sensitivity of 96.9% (95% CI 91.9% to 98.8%) and summary specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 96.1% to 100%) for 3D SIS. For 2D SIS, summary sensitivity was 90.9% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.8%) and summary specificity was 96.3% (95% CI 86.1% to 99.1%). The difference in accuracy between 2D SIS and 3D SIS was non‐significant (P values of 0.07 for sensitivity and 0.10 for specificity). Authors' conclusions Low‐quality evidence suggests that 3D SIS may be very accurate in detecting intracavitary abnormalities. Meta‐analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between 2D SIS and 3D SIS. Summary sensitivity and summary specificity are higher for 3D SIS, but margins of improvement are limited because 2D SIS is already very accurate. When the technology and appropriate expertise are available, 3D SIS offers an alternative to 2D SIS. Both 2D SIS and 3D SIS should be considered alternatives to diagnostic hysteroscopy when intracavitary pathology is suspected in subfertile women and in those with abnormal uterine bleeding.","Is three‐dimensional saline infusion sonography (3D SIS) better than two‐dimensional (2D) SIS for detecting polyps and fibroids? Review question Is three‐dimensional saline infusion sonography (3D SIS) better than two‐dimensional (2D) SIS for detecting polyps and fibroids? Background The womb (uterus) is one of the female reproductive organs. Inside the cavity of the womb, abnormalities such as polyps and fibroids can grow. Polyps and fibroids can cause problems such as abnormal menstrual bleeding and difficulty getting pregnant. The presence of these polyps and fibroids may be a reason for clinicians to start drug therapy or remove the polyps and fibroids during surgery. Ultrasonography can provide a picture of the womb and of possible fibroids or polyps. Saline or gel inside the cavity of the womb makes the ultrasound image more clear. This technique is called saline infusion sonography (SIS). Usually, this picture is only two‐dimensional. Nowadays, it is possible to make a three‐dimensional picture so the type of abnormality can be better seen. Study characteristics Review authors searched for studies published from inception until March 2016 and found 13 studies (in total 1053 women), eight of which directly compared 3D SIS versus 2D SIS. Data included all women reporting abnormal menstrual bleeding or difficulty getting pregnant. The number of patients in these studies varied from 23 to 180 women. Quality of the evidence In all studies, researchers checked the results of 2D SIS and 3D SIS against results obtained when a camera was used to look inside the womb (hysteroscopy); this is expected to give the true picture but is also more painful for the patient. All studies were performed in the usual way. Some studies did not report several items that might have influenced the results. For example, not all studies made it clear that the person evaluating the ultrasound pictures was unaware of the hysteroscopy results, and vice versa. The main problem involving the quality of included studies is insufficient reporting of study methods, resulting in unclear risk of bias for several of the quality domains assessed. Therefore, review authors considered the overall quality of the evidence as low. Key results Low‐quality evidence suggests that 3D SIS may be very accurate in detecting polyps and fibroids. Our analysis revealed no clear differences between 2D SIS and 3D SIS. Summary results are higher for 3D SIS but margins of improvement are limited because 2D SIS is already very accurate. Results show that 2D SIS missed a fibroid or polyp in 9 of 100 women and 3D SIS missed a polyp or fibroid in 3 of 100 women who had them. In 4 of 100 women, 2D SIS indicated the presence of polyps or fibroids when there were none, and in less than 1 in 100 women, 3D SIS was wrong. In theory, if both tests were used in a group of 1000 women with abnormal menstrual bleeding, 300 with fibroids or polyps, 27 of the 300 women with polyps/fibroids will be missed by 2D SIS, and 9 of 300 will be missed by 3D SIS. 3D SIS is an alternative to 2D SIS for which the technology and appropriate expertise are available. Both 2D SIS and 3D SIS should be considered alternatives to diagnostic hysteroscopy when intracavitary pathology is suspected in subfertile women and in those with abnormal uterine bleeding.",CD011126
"Background Patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL) still have a poor outcome, despite multi‐modality intensive therapy. This poor outcome necessitates the search for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‐MIBG). Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 25 April 2016) and Embase (Ovid) (1980 to 25 April 2016). In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We also assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology, Advances in Neuroblastoma Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology; all from 2010 up to and including 2015. We scanned the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.isrctn.com) and the National Institutes of Health Register for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non‐randomised single‐arm trials with historical controls and cohort studies examining the efficacy of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in 10 or more patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We identified two eligible cohort studies including 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. All studies had methodological limitations, with regard to both internal (risk of bias) and external validity. As the studies were not comparable with regard to prognostic factors and treatment (and often used different outcome definitions), pooling of results was not possible. In one study, the objective response rate (ORR) was 73% after surgery; the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 23); five‐year overall survival was 14.6%; median event‐free survival was 10 months (95% CI 7 to 13); and five‐year event‐free survival was 12.2%. In the other study, the ORR was 56% after myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation; 10‐year overall survival was 6.25%; and event‐free survival was not reported. With regard to short‐term adverse effects, one study showed a prevalence of 2% (95% CI 0% to 13%; best‐case scenario) for death due to myelosuppression. After the first cycle of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in one study, platelet toxicity occurred in 38% (95% CI 18% to 61%), neutrophil toxicity in 50% (95% CI 28% to 72%) and haemoglobin toxicity in 69% (95% CI 44% to 86%); after the second cycle this was 60% (95% CI 36% to 80%) for platelets and neutrophils and 53% (95% CI 30% to 75%) for haemoglobin. In one study, the prevalence of hepatic toxicity during or within four weeks after last the MIBG treatment was 0% (95% CI 0% to 9%; best‐case scenario). Neither study reported cardiovascular toxicity and sialoadenitis. One study assessed long‐term adverse events in some of the children: there was elevated plasma thyroid‐stimulating hormone in 45% (95% CI 27% to 65%) of children; in all children, free T4 was within the age‐related normal range (0%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There were no secondary malignancies observed (0%, 95% CI 0% to 9%), but only five children survived more than four years. Authors' conclusions We identified no RCTs or CCTs comparing the effectiveness of treatment including  131 I‐MIBG therapy versus treatment not including  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. We found two small observational studies including chilren. They had high risk of bias, and not all relevant outcome results were available. Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‐quality research is needed.","Iodine‐131‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk neuroblastoma Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness and side effects of  131 I‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‐MIBG) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL). Background NBL is a rare solid cancer that develops from special nerves cells. Patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL have a poor outcome, despite intensive treatments such as high‐dose chemotherapy to kill the cancer and surgery. This poor outcome needs research to look for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‐MIBG, which is a type of targeted radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer without causing too much damage to surrounding area). Study characteristics The evidence is current to April 2016. We found two cohort studies (where a group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) looking at  131 I‐MIBG treatment in 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Key results The studies were not comparable with regard to the children, the ways they were treated and the ways the different outcomes were defined and so it was impossible to combine the results in an analysis. Not all relevant outcome results were available. The percentages of children whose cancer reduced or disappeared after treatment (response rate) were 56% and 73% in the two studies, but survival was still poor: overall survival (length of time that the child remained alive) was about 15 months, event‐free survival (time during which there were no objective signs of tumor recurrence) was about 10 months. Overall survival five years after treatment was 14.6%, and after 10 years was 12.2%. With regard to short‐term side effects, there were some low blood cell counts. There was no liver toxicity. The studies did not report on heart problems and infections of the salivary glands. One study assessed long‐term side effects in some of the children: there was some evidence of thyroid (a gland in the neck) problems, which was brief in three children, but remained high in seven children, of whom five were prescribed medicine. There were no secondary cancers (where a different type of cancer has returned following the original cancer). Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‐quality research is needed before definite conclusions can be made. Quality of the evidence All studies had problems relating to quality of the evidence.",CD010349
"Background Current treatment guidelines for limited‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) recommend concomitant platinum‐based chemo‐radiotherapy plus prophylactic cranial irradiation, based on the premise that SCLC disseminates early, and is chemosensitive. However, although there is usually a favourable initial response, relapse is common and the cure rate for limited‐stage SCLC remains relatively poor. Some recent clinical practice guidelines have recommended surgery for stage 1 (limited) SCLC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, but this recommendation is largely based on the findings of observational studies. Objectives To determine whether, in patients with limited‐stage SCLC, surgical resection of cancer improves overall survival and treatment‐related deaths compared with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or best supportive care. Search methods We performed searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 11 January 2017. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with adults diagnosed with limited‐stage SCLC, confirmed by cytology or histology, and radiological assessment, considered medically suitable for resection and radical radiotherapy, which randomised participants to surgery versus any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full‐text version of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were overall survival and treatment‐related deaths; and secondary outcome measures included loco‐regional progression, quality of life, and adverse events. Main results We included three trials with 330 participants. We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for all the outcomes. The quality of the data was limited by the lack of complete outcome reporting, unclear risk of bias in the methods in which the studies were conducted, and the age of the studies (> 20 years). The methods of cancer staging and types of surgical procedures, which do not reflect current practice, reduced our confidence in the estimation of the effect. Two studies compared surgery to radiation therapy, and in one study chemotherapy was administered to both arms. One study administered initial chemotherapy, then responders were randomised to surgery versus control; following, both groups underwent chest and whole brain irradiation. Due to the clinical heterogeneity of the trials, we were unable to pool results for meta‐analysis. All three studies reported overall survival. One study reported a mean overall survival of 199 days in the surgical arm, compared to 300 days in the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.04). One study reported overall survival as 4% in the surgical arm, compared to 10% in the radiotherapy arm at two years. Conversely, one study reported overall survival at two years as 52% in the surgical arm, compared to 18% in the radiotherapy arm. However this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). One study reported early postoperative mortality as 7% for the surgical arm, compared to 0% mortality in the radiotherapy arm. One study reported the difference in mean degree of dyspnoea as −1.2 comparing surgical intervention to radiotherapy, indicating that participants undergoing radiotherapy are likely to experience more dyspnoea. This was measured using a non‐validated scale. Authors' conclusions Evidence from currently available RCTs does not support a role for surgical resection in the management of limited‐stage small‐cell lung cancer; however our conclusions are limited by the quality of the available evidence and the lack of contemporary data. The results of the trials included in this review may not be generalisable to patients with clinical stage 1 small‐cell lung cancer carefully staged using contemporary staging methods. Although some guidelines currently recommend surgical resection in clinical stage 1 small‐cell lung cancer, prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to determine if there is any benefit in terms of short‐ and long‐term mortality and quality of life compared with chemo‐radiotherapy alone.","Surgery for limited‐stage small‐cell lung cancer Background There are different types of lung cancer. One type is called small‐cell lung cancer. Small‐cell lung cancer is considered limited‐stage if it is still within the chest or extensive‐stage if it has spread outside the chest. Currently, chemotherapy and radiation therapy is recommended for treatment of limited‐stage small‐cell lung cancer if it is localised and has not spread outside one side of the chest. Review question We wanted to know if people with small‐cell lung cancer that has not spread outside the chest live longer with an operation to remove the tumour, whether accompanied by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both or neither, compared to chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Study characteristics We searched for clinical trials up to 11 January 2017, and we included three studies with 330 people who had been diagnosed with small‐cell lung cancer which had not spread outside the chest. Some were given surgery only, and some were not. Also, some were given chemotherapy and radiotherapy along with their surgery, and some were given chemotherapy and radiotherapy without surgery. We looked for a difference in how long people lived, and if their treatment caused any side effects. Key findings The data were all of very low quality. All three studies were quite different so could not be combined. One study reported that people lived longer without surgery (but with radiotherapy) than with surgery. One study reported 4% of people surviving at two years with surgery compared to 10% of people surviving with radiotherapy. One study reported 52% of people surviving with surgery compared to 18% of people surviving with radiotherapy. Our evidence does not support the use of surgery for people with small‐cell lung cancer, but the quality of data is low and from more than 20 years ago. Better trials are needed to properly compare surgery with no surgery in people with small‐cell lung cancer. Quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence using one of the following grades: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means we are uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means we are very certain about the results. For this Cochrane Review, we found that the evidence was of very low quality for all the outcomes studies. We could not combine the trials as they were all very different, and the trials were very old. Some trials did not give enough information about their quality.",CD011917
"Background Adolescents with asthma are at high risk of poor adherence with treatment. This may be compounded by activities that worsen asthma, in particular smoking. Additional support above and beyond routine care has the potential to encourage good self‐management. We wanted to find out whether sessions led by their peers or by lay leaders help to reduce these risks and improve asthma outcomes among adolescents. Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of lay‐led and peer support interventions for adolescents with asthma. Search methods We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains reports of randomised trials obtained from multiple electronic and handsearched sources, and we searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 25 November 2016. Selection criteria Eligible studies randomised adolescents with asthma to an intervention led by lay people or peers or to a control. We included parallel randomised controlled trials with individual or cluster designs. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened the searches, extracted numerical data and study characteristics and assessed each included study for risk of bias. Primary outcomes were asthma‐related quality of life and exacerbations requiring at least a course of oral steroids. We graded the analyses and presented evidence in a 'Summary of findings' table. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences, all with a random‐effects model. We assessed clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity when performing meta‐analyses, and we described skewed data narratively. Main results Five studies including a total of 1146 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. As ever with systematic reviews of complex interventions, studies varied by design (cluster and individually randomised), duration (2.5 to 9 months), setting (school, day camp, primary care) and intervention content. Most risk of bias concerns were related to blinding and incomplete reporting, which limited the meta‐analyses that could be performed. Studies generally controlled well for selection and attrition biases. All participants were between 11 and 17 years of age. Asthma diagnosis and severity varied, as did smoking prevalence. Three studies used the Triple A programme; one of these studies tested the addition of a smoke‐free pledge; another delivered peer support group sessions and mp3 messaging to encourage adherence; and the third compared a peer‐led asthma day camp with an equivalent camp led by healthcare practitioners. We had low confidence in all findings owing to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Results from an analysis of asthma‐related quality of life based on the prespecified random‐effects model were imprecise and showed no differences (MD 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.02 to 0.81); a sensitivity analysis based on a fixed‐effect model and a responder analysis suggested small benefit may be derived for this outcome. Most other results were summarised narratively and did not show an important benefit of the intervention; studies provided no analysable data on asthma exacerbations or unscheduled visits (data were skewed), and one study measuring adherence reported a drop in both groups. Effects on asthma control favoured the intervention but findings were not statistically significant. Results from two studies with high levels of baseline smoking showed some promise for self‐efficacy to stop smoking, but overall nicotine dependence and smoking‐related knowledge were not significantly better in the intervention group. Investigators did not report adverse events. Authors' conclusions Although weak evidence suggests that lay‐led and peer support interventions could lead to a small improvement in asthma‐related quality of life for adolescents, benefits for asthma control, exacerbations and medication adherence remain unproven. Current evidence is insufficient to reveal whether routine use of lay‐led or peer support programmes is beneficial for adolescents receiving asthma care. Ongoing and future research may help to identify target populations for lay‐led and peer support interventions, along with attributes that constitute a successful programme.","Support from peers or lay leaders for adolescents with asthma Background to the question Adolescents may need extra support to manage their asthma, as they are at higher risk of not taking their inhalers properly and of engaging in activities that may make their asthma worse (such as smoking). We wanted to find out whether sessions led by peers or by lay leaders (i.e. not healthcare professionals) help to reduce these risks and lead to better asthma control. We included studies that compared this support against usual care or a different type of help. We conducted the most recent searches on 25 November 2016. Study characteristics We found five studies including 1146 adolescents with asthma. Studies varied by design, duration (2.5 to 9 months), setting (school, day camp, primary care) and the way that peer support or lay‐led sessions were given. Asthma severity varied, as did the number who smoked. Three studies used a programme called Triple A (Adolescent Asthma Action), by which older adolescents are trained to deliver sessions to younger students; one of these studies tested the addition of a pledge to stop smoking; another delivered peer support group sessions including messages played through an mp3 player to encourage adherence; and the third compared an asthma day camp led by peers against one led by nurses and doctors. Key results Adolescents who received peer support had better quality of life than those in the control group, although this varied with how results were analysed, so we were uncertain. Most other outcomes did not show an important benefit of the intervention. These studies provided very little information about asthma attacks or unscheduled visits during the trial, and we couldn't be sure whether the intervention was beneficial in terms of asthma control. Results from two studies in which a lot of the adolescents smoked showed some promise that adolescents had the confidence to stop, but overall nicotine dependence and smoking‐related knowledge were not much better than in controls. Studies provided no reports of adverse events. Quality of the evidence We can't be sure of the results because most outcomes were rated by people who knew the group to which adolescents were assigned, and this can affect how people behave and respond to questions. Some studies didn't report everything they said they would, or reported information that we could not analyse. Sometimes study results didn't agree with results of other studies, and often we could not say for certain whether adolescents received benefit. For these reasons, we have low confidence in all study findings.",CD012331
"Background Aortic valve disease is a common condition that is easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum longitudinally down the centre (""median sternotomy"") and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is generally well tolerated, but as less invasive options have become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access has raised safety concerns with regards to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de‐airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. Objectives To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement. Search methods We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, and manufacturers' websites from inception to July 2016, with no language limitations. We reviewed references of identified papers to identify any further studies of relevance. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini‐thoracotomies, port access, trans‐apical, trans‐femoral or robotic procedures. Although some well‐conducted prospective and retrospective case‐control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. The quality of evidence was determined using the GRADE methodology and results of patient‐relevant outcomes were summarised in a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results The review included seven trials with 511 participants. These included adults from centres in Austria, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and Egypt. We performed 12 comparisons investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi‐sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. There was no evidence of any effect of upper hemi‐sternotomy on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 2.82; participants = 511; studies = 7; moderate quality). There was no evidence of an increase in cardiopulmonary bypass time with aortic valve replacement performed via an upper hemi‐sternotomy (mean difference (MD) 3.02 minutes, 95% CI ‐4.10 to 10.14; participants = 311; studies = 5; low quality). There was no evidence of an increase in aortic cross‐clamp time (MD 0.95 minutes, 95% CI ‐3.45 to 5.35; participants = 391; studies = 6; low quality). None of the included studies reported major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events as a composite end point. There was no evidence of an effect on length of hospital stay through limited hemi‐sternotomy (MD ‐1.31 days, 95% CI ‐2.63 to 0.01; participants = 297; studies = 5; I 2  = 89%; very low quality). Postoperative blood loss was lower in the upper hemi‐sternotomy group (MD ‐158.00 mL, 95% CI ‐303.24 to ‐12.76; participants = 297; studies = 5; moderate quality). The evidence did not support a reduction in deep sternal wound infections (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.30; participants = 511; studies = 7; moderate quality) or re‐exploration (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.13; participants = 511; studies = 7; moderate quality). There was no change in pain scores by upper hemi‐sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.85 to 0.20; participants = 197; studies = 3; I 2  = 70%; very low quality), but there was a small increase in postoperative pulmonary function tests with minimally invasive limited sternotomy (MD 1.98 % predicted FEV1, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.33; participants = 257; studies = 4; I 2  = 28%; low quality). There was a small reduction in length of intensive care unit stays as a result of the minimally invasive upper hemi‐sternotomy (MD ‐0.57 days, 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.20; participants = 297; studies = 5; low quality). Postoperative atrial fibrillation was not reduced with minimally invasive aortic valve replacement through limited compared to full sternotomy (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.89; participants = 240; studies = 3; moderate quality), neither were postoperative ventilation times (MD ‐1.12 hours, 95% CI ‐3.43 to 1.19; participants = 297; studies = 5; low quality). None of the included studies reported cost analyses. Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review was assessed as generally low to moderate quality. The study sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in outcomes with low event rates. Clinical heterogeneity both between and within studies is a relatively fixed feature of surgical trials, and this also contributed to the need for caution in interpreting results. Considering these limitations, there was uncertainty of the effect on mortality or extracorporeal support times with upper hemi‐sternotomy for aortic valve replacement compared to full median sternotomy. The evidence to support a reduction in total hospital length of stay or intensive care stay was low in quality. There was also uncertainty of any difference in the rates of other, secondary outcome measures or adverse events with minimally invasive limited sternotomy approaches to aortic valve replacement. There appears to be uncertainty between minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via upper hemi‐sternotomy and conventional aortic valve replacement via a full median sternotomy. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well‐designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality‐of‐life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.","Heart surgery for aortic valve replacement through a small incision versus the standard full incision at the front of the chest What question were we trying to answer? We reviewed the evidence on the effect of a smaller ""keyhole""‐type cut (instead of the usual full cut down the breastbone) on aortic valve replacement surgery in adults. We wanted to see if both were as safe and effective as each other. Why is this important? The aortic valve prevents blood from flowing backwards from the body back into the heart. Aortic valve disease is a common condition that is treated best with heart surgery. The usual way of performing this is by splitting the entire breastbone lengthways to gain access to the heart, but this is thought to be painful and disruptive. For nearly 20 years, some surgeons have been doing the operation through a smaller hole, cutting part of the breastbone instead of the whole length. Doing it this way makes the scar smaller, but can also make the operation more challenging because it is more difficult to see and reach the heart. This might make the operation longer and less safe, even though it looks smaller from the outside. Which studies were included in this review? We checked scientific databases to find published and unpublished studies that compared fully opening the breastbone (called ""median sternotomy"") for aortic valve replacement against opening just part of the breastbone (called ""minimally invasive"" or ""partial"" sternotomy) for the same operation. We searched all records up to July 2016 and found seven studies that answered this question that had 511 participants in them. How were the studies designed? The studies came from countries in Europe and North Africa. There were 511 participants, with a mixture of different conditions needing aortic valve replacement. Most of these people were 60 to 70 years old and approximately half were male. The participants in each group were similar. One of the studies was funded by a company that makes equipment for doing minimally invasive surgery. What did the studies show? There was no difference between the groups in the number of people who died as a result of having surgery. If 23 out of every 1000 people who had the full‐size cut in their breastbone died after the operation, around 24 (somewhere between eight and 66) in every 1000 would die using the ""keyhole"" operation. Because that range goes from three times less to three times more, it is difficult to say whether the operation is definitely better or worse. The amount of time that surgeons needed to use a heart‐lung machine to support the heart while doing the operation was also not different. Neither was the amount of time that the heart was completely stopped to do the operation. There was little difference in the amount of time participants were on the ventilator or in hospital, although the time spent on the intensive care unit was less by about half a day in the group with the smaller incision. None of the important problems that occur after heart surgery were more common in either group (infections around the heart, irregular heart rhythms or the need for an urgent reoperation because of bleeding). Participants bled slightly less after having minimally invasive surgery. In the operation with the smaller cut, the average blood loss was 158 mL less. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. One of the main problems with the studies was that they were small and may not have picked up subtle differences between the groups. Because problems after heart surgery are rare, we need to assess lots of people having operations in order to spot small changes. Another problem is that surgeons tend to have lots of slightly different ways in which they do operations. There were also differences in practice, meaning that measurements might not have been taken at the same times, using the same ways. We need to be careful about making conclusions about which differences in the groups in this review were due to the smaller incision and which were due to other factors.",CD011793
"Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas‐Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4% and 25% of school‐aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either excluding ingredients from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain‐related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow‐up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic‐based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre‐based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose‐restricted diets (one study). We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies. We found that children treated with fibre‐based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose‐restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. We were unable to perform any meta‐analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions Overall, we found moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer‐term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome. We found only a small number of trials of fibre‐based interventions, with overall low‐quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre‐based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high‐quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence‐based recommendations.","Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in children Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effects of dietary interventions on pain in children aged between five and 18 years with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). Background Recurrent abdominal pain, or RAP, is a term used for unexplained episodes of stomachache or abdominal pain in children. Recurrent abdominal pain is a common condition, and most children are likely to be helped by simple measures. However, a range of treatments have been recommended to relieve abdominal pain, including making changes to the child's eating habits by adding supplements or excluding certain foods. Study characteristics This evidence is current to June 2016. Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose‐restricted diet. All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. Key results Probiotics We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. Fibre supplements We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. Low FODMAP diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. Fructose‐restricted diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose‐restricted diets in children with RAP. Conclusion We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best. We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high‐quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments.",CD010972
"Background The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are considered essential for maturation of the developing brain, retina and other organs in newborn infants. Standard infant milk formulae are not supplemented with LCPUFA; they contain only alpha‐linolenic acid and linoleic acid, from which formula‐fed infants must synthesise their own DHA and AA, respectively. Over the past few years, some manufacturers have added LCPUFA to formula milk and have marketed these products as providing an advantage for the overall development of full‐term infants. Objectives To assess whether supplementation of formula milk with LCPUFA is both safe and beneficial for full‐term infants, while focusing on effects on visual function, neurodevelopment and physical growth. Search methods Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; December 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to December 2016), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to December 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1980 to December 2016) and abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies (2000 to 2016). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We reviewed all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating effects of LCPUFA supplemented versus non‐supplemented formula milk on visual function, neurodevelopment and physical growth. We did not include trials reporting only biochemical outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the guidelines of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. When appropriate, we conducted meta‐analysis to determine a pooled estimate of effect. Main results We identified 31 RCTs and included 15 of these in the review (N = 1889). Nine studies assessed visual acuity, six of which used visual evoked potentials (VEP), two Teller cards and one both. Four studies reported beneficial effects, and the remaining five did not. Meta‐analysis of three RCTs showed significant benefit for sweep VEP acuity at 12 months (log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)) (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.17 to ‐0.13; I 2  = 0; three trials; N = 244), but meta‐analysis of three other RCTs showed no benefit for visual acuity measured with Teller cards at 12 months (cycles/degree) (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.11; I 2  = 0; three trials; N = 256). GRADE analysis for the outcome of visual acuity indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low. Eleven studies measured neurodevelopmental outcomes at or before two years. Nine studies used Bayley Scales of Infant Development, version II (BSID‐II), and only two of these studies reported beneficial effects. Meta‐analysis revealed no significant differences between LCPUFA and placebo groups in BSID Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 2.14; I 2  = 75%; four trials; N = 661) and no significant differences in BSID Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.69, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 2.16; I 2  = 61%; four trials; N = 661). Results showed no significant differences between the two groups in BSID‐II scores at one year and two years of age. One study reported better novelty preference measured by the Fagan Infant Test at nine months. Another study reported better problem solving at 10 months. One study used the Brunet and Lezine test to assess the developmental quotient and found no beneficial effects. Follow‐up of some infants in different studies at three, six and nine years of age revealed no beneficial effects of supplementation. GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low. Thirteen studies measured physical growth; none found beneficial or harmful effects of supplementation. Meta‐analysis of five RCTs showed that the supplemented group had lower weight (z scores) at one year of age (MD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.06; I 2  = 83%; N = 521) and that the two groups showed no significant differences with respect to length and head circumference (z scores). Meta‐analysis at 18 months and at two years revealed no significant differences between the two groups with respect to weight (kg), length (cm) and head circumference (cm). GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low. Authors' conclusions Most of the included RCTs reported no beneficial effects or harms of LCPUFA supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes of formula‐fed full‐term infants and no consistent beneficial effects on visual acuity. Routine supplementation of full‐term infant milk formula with LCPUFA cannot be recommended at this time.",Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infants born at term Review question:  Does feeding full‐term babies with formula milk enriched with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) result in improved vision and overall neurodevelopment compared with feeding formula milk not enriched with LCPUFA? Background:  LCPUFA is a type of fat that is essential for the development of brain and vision in newborn babies. Breast milk contains adequate amounts of LCPUFA and hence is considered better than formula milk. Some milk formulae with added LCPUFA are commercially available. Study characteristics:  This review analysed studies that compared outcomes of full‐term babies (born at ≥ 37 weeks of pregnancy) who were given formula milk enriched with LCPUFA versus outcomes of full‐term babies fed formula milk without enrichment with LCPUFA. Key results:  Review authors found that full‐term babies fed formula milk supplemented with LCPUFA did not have better outcomes than were reported for full‐term babies fed formula milk without LCPUFA. Quality of evidence:  We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low.,CD000376
"Background Ischaemia reperfusion injury can lead to kidney dysfunction or failure. Ischaemic preconditioning is a short period of deprivation of blood supply to particular organs or tissue, followed by a period of reperfusion. It has the potential to protect kidneys from ischaemia reperfusion injury. Objectives This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of local and remote ischaemic preconditioning to reduce ischaemia and reperfusion injury among people with renal ischaemia reperfusion injury. Search methods We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 5 August 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials measuring kidney function and the role of ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing a surgical intervention that induces kidney injury. Kidney transplantation studies were excluded. Data collection and analysis Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality; data were extracted by two independent authors. We collected basic study characteristics: type of surgery, remote ischaemic preconditioning protocol, type of anaesthesia. We collected primary outcome measurements: serum creatinine and adverse effects to remote ischaemic preconditioning and secondary outcome measurements: acute kidney injury, need for dialysis, neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, hospital stay and mortality. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Main results We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients. Risk of bias assessment indicated unclear to low risk of bias for most studies. For consistency regarding the direction of effects, continuous outcomes with negative values, and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one favour remote ischaemic preconditioning. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD ‐0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.02; I 2  = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD ‐0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.02; I 2  = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD ‐0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; I 2  = 68%) compared to control. Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping. It is uncertain whether remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation leads to increased adverse effects compared to control because the certainty of the evidence is low (15 studies, 3993 participants: RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.55 to 21.76; I 2  = 0%); only two of 15 studies reported any adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group), the remaining 13 studies stated no adverse effects were observed in either group. Compared to control, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the need for dialysis (13 studies, 2417 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; I 2  = 60%; moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (8 studies, 920 participants: MD 0.17 days, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.80; I 2  = 49%, high quality evidence), or all‐cause mortality (24 studies, 4931 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.37; I 2  = 0%, high quality evidence). Remote ischaemic preconditioning may have slightly improved the incidence of acute kidney injury using either the AKIN (8 studies, 2364 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; I 2  = 61%, high quality evidence) or RIFLE criteria (3 studies, 1586 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation appears to be a safe method, and probably leads to little or no difference in serum creatinine, adverse effects, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, death and in the incidence of acute kidney injury. Overall we had moderate‐high certainty evidence however the available data does not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac and vascular surgery in which renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur.","Short periods of limb blood flow obstruction to reduce kidney injury What is the issue? The kidney is highly sensitive to shortage in blood flow and thus oxygen supply. This may cause irreversible kidney injury leading to haemodialysis or death. Kidney injury does not only relate to the temporary lack of oxygen supply, but is also due to the re‐saturation of blood flow. At this stage, toxic products are released and initiate a reaction of the body causing further cellular damage within the kidney, the so called ‘ischaemia‐reperfusion injury’. A lack of oxygen supply to the kidney injury may have many different causes, for example blood pressure changes that may occur during major surgery. What did we do? Our hypothesis is that short harmless periods (5 minutes) of blood flow obstruction to an organ can reduce injury in this particular organ (local ischaemic preconditioning), but can also reduce injury in other organs at a distance (remote ischaemic preconditioning). A blood flow obstruction can easily and safely be achieved in a limb by inflating blood pressure cuff around the upper arm or leg. The mechanism of this remote ischaemic preconditioning is not precisely known, it is assumed that a protective signal from the remote organ to the kidney is transferred through the blood stream or nervous system. In this analysis our primary goal is to investigate whether remote ischaemic preconditioning is safe and effective in reducing kidney injury in patients undergoing a (surgical) procedure in which kidney injury may occur. Kidney injury after kidney transplantation may have a different underlying pathophysiology and therefore these studies are not taken into account. The impact of remote ischaemic preconditioning on the need for dialysis, hospital stay and mortality will be assessed. What did we find? We performed a search off all available literature on 8 August 2016 to find all randomised controlled studies. 28 studies including 6851 patients were included in this analysis. Five studies included children undergoing cardiac surgery. Adult studies included patients undergoing major vascular surgery (three studies), cardiac surgery (nine studies), coronary bypass surgery (10 studies) and partial kidney resection (one study). The overall quality of the studies was acceptable. Twenty studies were funded without economical interest. One study was funded from a source with commercial interest. The other seven studies did not report funding. Remote ischaemic preconditioning performed with a blood pressure cuff appears to be safe as only two of 15 studies reported adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group). However remote ischaemic preconditioning by vascular clamping may cause vascular complications. Kidney injury in patients undergoing (surgical) procedures in which kidney injury may occur, was not reduced by remote Ischaemic preconditioning measured at day one, two or three after surgery. The need for dialysis, hospital stay and death were not reduced by remote ischaemic preconditioning. Conclusion Although remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation is safe, available data do not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing kidney injury.",CD010777
"Background  Clostridium difficile  ( C. difficile ) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for  C. difficile‐ associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or  C. difficile  infection (CDI), being synonymous terms. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed‐effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random‐effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death and cost. Main results Twenty‐two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded patients with severe CDI and few patients with severe CDI were included in the other six studies. Twelve different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin, cadazolid, LFF517, surotomycin and fidaxomicin. Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo. There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a 'no treatment' control group. The risk of bias was rated as high for 17 of 22 included studies. Vancomycin was found to be more effective than metronidazole for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy‐two per cent (318/444) of metronidazole patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 79% (339/428) of vancomycin patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence). Fidaxomicin was found to be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy‐one per cent (407/572) of fidaxomicin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 61% (361/592) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; moderate quality evidence). Teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving a symptomatic cure. Eightly‐seven per cent (48/55) of teicoplanin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 73% (40/55) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). For other comparisons including the one placebo‐controlled study the quality of evidence was low or very low due to imprecision and in many cases high risk of bias because of attrition and lack of blinding. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed by study authors to the co‐morbidities of the participants that lead to acquiring CDI. Although many other adverse events were reported during therapy, these were attributed to the participants' co‐morbidities. The only adverse events directly attributed to study medication were rare nausea and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13 (Health Warehouse). Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 (Walgreens for 56 tablets) compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more (Optimer Pharmaceuticals) and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67 (GBP 71.40, British National Formulary). Authors' conclusions No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded patients with severe disease. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the initiating antibiotic. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other two antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin, would be of interest.","Antibiotic therapy for  Clostridium difficile‐ associated diarrhoea in adults Background Clostridium difficile  ( C. difficile ) is a bacterium that can live harmlessly in the colon, but when an individual takes an antibiotic for another condition, the  C. difficile  can grow and replace most of the normal bacterial flora that live in the colon. This overgrowth causes  C. difficile ‐associated diarrhoea (also known as  C. difficile  infection ‐ CDI). The symptoms of CDI include diarrhoea, fever and pain. CDI may be only mild but in many cases is very serious and, if untreated, can be fatal. There are many proposed treatments for CDI, but the most common are withdrawing the antibiotic that caused the CDI and prescribing an antibiotic that kills the bacterium. Many antibiotics have been tested in clinical trials for effectiveness and this review studies the comparisons of these antibiotics. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Methods We searched the medical literature up to 26 January 2017. All randomised trials that compare two different antibiotics, or variations in dosing of a single antibiotic for treatment of CDI were included. Trials comparing antibiotic to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) or no treatment were sought but, save for one poor quality placebo‐controlled trial, none were found. Trials that compared antibiotics to a non‐antibiotic treatment were not included. Results Twenty‐two studies (total 3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled participants with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded participants with severe CDI and few participants with severe CDI were included in the other studies. Twelve different antibiotics were assessed. Most of the studies compared vancomycin or metronidazole with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo (e.g. sugar pill). There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a no treatment control group. Seventeen of the 22 included studies had quality issues. In four studies, vancomycin was found to be superior to metronidazole for achieving sustained symptomatic cure (defined as resolution of diarrhoea and no recurrence of CDI). We rated the quality of the evidence supporting this finding as moderate. A new antibiotic, fidaxomicin, was, in two large studies, found to be superior to vancomycin. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding was moderate. It should be noted that the differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too great and that metronidazole is far less expensive than either vancomycin and fidaxomicin. A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests that teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding was very low. The quality of the evidence for the other seven antibiotics in this review was very poor because the studies were very small, and many patients dropped out of these studies before completion. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed to participants preexisting health problems. The only side effects attributed to antibiotics were rare nausea and temporary elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13. Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67. Conclusion No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded these patients. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the antibiotic that caused CDI. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other antibiotics.

"Background Shared care has been used in the management of many chronic conditions with the assumption that it delivers better care than primary or specialty care alone; however, little is known about the effectiveness of shared care. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of shared care health service interventions designed to improve the management of chronic disease across the primary/specialty care interface. This is an update of a previously published review. Secondary questions include the following: 1. Which shared care interventions or portions of shared care interventions are most effective? 2. What do the most effective systems have in common? Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library to 12 October 2015. Selection criteria One review author performed the initial abstract screen; then two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the effectiveness of shared care interventions for people with chronic conditions in primary care and community settings. The intervention was compared with usual care in that setting. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies, evaluated study quality and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta‐analysis of results when possible and carried out a narrative synthesis of the remainder of the results. We presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table, using a tabular format to show effect sizes for all outcome types. Main results We identified 42 studies of shared care interventions for chronic disease management (N = 18,859), 39 of which were RCTs, two CBAs and one an NRCT. Of these 42 studies, 41 examined complex multi‐faceted interventions and lasted from six to 24 months. Overall, our confidence in results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from moderate to high certainty. Results showed probably few or no differences in clinical outcomes overall with a tendency towards improved blood pressure management in the small number of studies on shared care for hypertension, chronic kidney disease and stroke (mean difference (MD) 3.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 5.25)(based on moderate‐certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved, particularly in response to depression treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.62; six studies, N = 1708) and recovery from depression (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.26; 10 studies, N = 4482) in studies examining the 'stepped care' design of shared care interventions (based on high‐certainty evidence). Investigators noted modest effects on mean depression scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.20; six studies, N = 3250). Differences in patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs), processes of care and participation and default rates in shared care services were probably limited (based on moderate‐certainty evidence). Studies probably showed little or no difference in hospital admissions, service utilisation and patient health behaviours (with evidence of moderate certainty). Authors' conclusions This review suggests that shared care improves depression outcomes and probably has mixed or limited effects on other outcomes. Methodological shortcomings, particularly inadequate length of follow‐up, may account in part for these limited effects. Review findings support the growing evidence base for shared care in the management of depression, particularly stepped care models of shared care. Shared care interventions for other conditions should be developed within research settings, with account taken of the complexity of such interventions and awareness of the need to carry out longer studies to test effectiveness and sustainability over time.","Shared care across the interface between primary and specialty care in chronic disease management What is the aim of this review? We conducted this Cochrane review to find out if shared care between primary and specialty care physicians improves outcomes for patients with chronic conditions. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed studies to answer this question and found 42 studies relevant for inclusion. Key messages This review suggests that shared care is effective for managing depression. Shared care interventions for other conditions should be developed within research settings, so that further evidence can be considered before they are introduced routinely into health systems. What was studied in this review? We have defined shared care across the primary/specialty interface as joint participation of primary care physicians and specialty care physicians in planned delivery of care. This may be informed by enhanced information exchange, over and above routine discharge and referral notices. This approach has the potential to improve the management of chronic disease while leading to better outcomes than are attained by primary or specialty care alone. What are the main results of the review? Review authors found 42 relevant studies; 39 were randomised controlled trials. Studies were based in 12 different countries that use a range of healthcare systems. Investigators examined shared care for a range of chronic conditions, with diabetes and depression the most commonly included. Most studies examined shared care interventions that consisted of multiple elements and lasted an average of 12 months. Study results suggest that shared care Interventions lead to improved outcomes for patients with depression. However, effects of shared care on a range of other outcomes are less certain. Shared care probably has limited or no effect on clinical outcomes, apart from modest effects on improving blood pressure management and mixed effects on patient‐reported outcome measures (such as quality of life and ability to carry out daily tasks), medication prescribing and use, participation in shared care services and management of risk factors. Shared care probably would have little or no effect on hospital admissions, use of services and patient health behaviours. How up‐to‐date is this review? Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to October 2015.",CD004910
"Background Physical activity, a balanced diet, avoidance of tobacco exposure, and limited alcohol consumption may reduce morbidity and mortality from non‐communicable diseases (NCDs). Mass media interventions are commonly used to encourage healthier behaviours in population groups. It is unclear whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more or less effective in changing behaviours than those developed for the general population. Objectives To determine the effects of mass media interventions targeting adult ethnic minorities with messages about physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of NCDs. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, SweMed+, and ISI Web of Science until August 2016. We also searched for grey literature in OpenGrey, Grey Literature Report, Eldis, and two relevant websites until October 2016. The searches were not restricted by language. Selection criteria We searched for individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Relevant interventions promoted healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption; were disseminated via mass media channels; and targeted ethnic minority groups. The population of interest comprised adults (≥ 18 years) from ethnic minority groups in the focal countries. Primary outcomes included indicators of behavioural change, self‐reported behavioural change and knowledge and attitudes towards change. Secondary outcomes were the use of health promotion services and costs related to the project. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed the references to identify studies for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in all included studies. We did not pool the results due to heterogeneity in comparisons made, outcomes, and study designs. We describe the results narratively and present them in 'Summary of findings' tables. We judged the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. Main results Six studies met the inclusion criteria, including three RCTs, two cluster‐RCTs and one ITS. All were conducted in the USA and comprised targeted mass media interventions for people of African descent (four studies), Spanish‐language dominant Latino immigrants (one study), and Chinese immigrants (one study). The two latter studies offered the intervention in the participants’ first language (Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin). Three interventions targeted towards women only, one pregnant women specifically. We judged all studies as being at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain and three studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. We categorised the findings into three comparisons. The first comparison examined mass media interventions targeted at ethnic minorities versus an equivalent mass media intervention intended for the general population. The one study in this category (255 participants of African decent) found little or no difference in effect on self‐reported behavioural change for smoking and only small differences in attitudes to change between participants who were given a culturally specific smoking cessation booklet versus a booklet intended for the general population. We are uncertain about the effect estimates, as assessed by the GRADE methodology (very low quality evidence of effect). No study provided data for indicators of behavioural change or adverse effects. The second comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus no intervention. One study (154 participants of African decent) reported effects for our primary outcomes. Participants in the intervention group had access to 12 one‐hour live programmes on cable TV and received print material over three months regarding nutrition and physical activity to improve health and weight control. Change in body mass index (BMI) was comparable between groups 12 months after the baseline (low quality evidence). Scores on a food habits (fat behaviours) and total leisure activity scores changed favourably for the intervention group (very low quality evidence). Two other studies exposed entire populations in geographical areas to radio advertisements targeted towards African American communities. Authors presented effects on two of our secondary outcomes, use of health promotion services and project costs. The campaign message was to call smoking quit lines. The outcome was the number of calls received. After one year, one study reported 18 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the intervention communities (estimated target population 310,500 persons), compared to 0.2 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the control communities (estimated target population 331,400 persons) (moderate quality evidence). The ITS study also reported an increase in the number of calls from the target population during campaigns (low quality evidence). The proportion of African American callers increased in both studies (low to very low quality evidence). No study provided data on knowledge and attitudes for change and adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse. The third comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus a mass media intervention plus personalised content. Findings are based on three studies (1361 participants). Participants in these comparison groups received personal feedback. Two of the studies recorded weight changes over time. Neither found significant differences between the groups (low quality evidence). Evidence on behavioural changes, and knowledge and attitudes typically found some effects in favour of receiving personalised content or no significant differences between groups (very low quality evidence). No study provided data on adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse. Authors' conclusions The available evidence is inadequate for understanding whether mass media interventions targeted toward ethnic minority populations are more effective in changing health behaviours than mass media interventions intended for the population at large. When compared to no intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit line, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. These studies could not distinguish the impact of different components, for instance the effect of hearing a message regarding behavioural change, the cultural adaptation to the ethnic minority group, or increase reach to the target group through more appropriate mass media channels. New studies should explore targeted interventions for ethnic minorities with a first language other than the dominant language in their resident country, as well as directly compare targeted versus general population mass media interventions.","Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities Background and review question Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. Study characteristics We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. Key results The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. Quality of the evidence Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines.",CD011683
"Background Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are key to better outcomes. Since many women will discover a breast cancer symptom themselves, it is important that they are breast cancer aware i.e. have the knowledge, skills and confidence to detect breast changes and present promptly to a healthcare professional. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (searched 25 January 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 27 January 2016), MEDLINE OvidSP (2008 to 27 January 2016), Embase (Embase.com, 2008 to 27 January 2016), the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 27 Feburary 2016). We also searched the reference lists of identified articles and reviews and the grey literature for conference proceedings and published abstracts. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on interventions for raising women’s breast cancer awareness i.e. knowledge of potential breast cancer symptoms/changes and the confidence to look at and feel their breasts, using any means of delivery, i.e. one‐to‐one/group/mass media campaign(s). Data collection and analysis Two authors selected studies, independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We reported the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. Since it was not possible to combine data from included studies due to their heterogeneity, we present a narrative synthesis. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included two RCTs involving 997 women: one RCT (867 women) randomised women to receive either a written booklet and usual care (intervention group 1), a written booklet and usual care plus a verbal interaction with a radiographer or research psychologist (intervention group 2) or usual care (control group); and the second RCT (130 women) randomised women to either an educational programme (three sessions of 60 to 90 minutes) or no intervention (control group). Knowledge of breast cancer symptoms In the first study, knowledge of non‐lump symptoms increased in intervention group 1 compared to the control group at two years postintervention, but not significantly (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.6; P = 0.66; 449 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Similarly, at two years postintervention, knowledge of symptoms increased in the intervention group 2 compared to the control group but not significantly (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.1; P = 0.11; 434 women; moderate‐quality evidence). In the second study, women’s awareness of breast cancer symptoms had increased one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 3.45, SD 5.11; 65 women; low‐quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD −0.68, SD 5.93; 65 women; P < 0.001), where there was a decrease in awareness. Knowledge of age‐related risk In the first study, women’s knowledge of age‐related risk of breast cancer increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8; 95% CI 0.9 to 3.5; P < 0.08; 447 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Women's knowledge of risk increased significantly in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 9.0; P < 0.001; 431 women; moderate‐quality evidence). In the second study, women’s perceived susceptibility (how at risk they considered themselves) to breast cancer had increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.31, SD 3.57; 65 women; low‐quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD −0.55, SD 3.31; 65 women; P = 0.005), where a decrease in perceived susceptibility was noted. Frequency of Breast Checking In the first study, no significant change was noted for intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; P = 0.54; 457 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Monthly breast checking increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9; P = 0.14; 445 women; moderate‐quality evidence). In the second study, women’s breast cancer preventive behaviours increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women; low‐quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P < 0.045). Breast Cancer Awareness Women’s overall breast cancer awareness did not change in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 5.30; P = 0.32; 435 women; moderate‐quality evidence) while overall awareness increased in the intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 8.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 25.0; P < 0.001; 420 women; moderate‐quality evidence). In the second study, there was a significant increase in scores on the Health Belief Model (that included the constructs of awareness and perceived susceptibility) at one month postintervention in the educational group (mean 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women) compared to the control group (mean 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P = 0.045). Neither study reported outcomes relating to motivation to check their breasts, confidence to seek help, time from breast symptom discovery to presentation to a healthcare professional, intentions to seek help, quality of life, adverse effects of the interventions, stages of breast cancer, survival estimates or breast cancer mortality rates. Authors' conclusions Based on the results of two RCTs, a brief intervention has the potential to increase women’s breast cancer awareness. However, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution, as GRADE assessment identified moderate‐quality evidence in only one of the two studies reviewed. In addition, the included trials were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions, population studied and outcomes measured. Therefore, current evidence cannot be generalised to the wider context. Further studies including larger samples, validated outcome measures and longitudinal approaches are warranted.","Interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women Review question     We reviewed the evidence about the effect of different interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women. We found two randomised controlled trials, the highest quality of research evidence. Background   Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are key to better outcomes. Since many women will discover a breast symptom themselves, it is important that they are breast cancer aware i.e. that they have the knowledge, skills and confidence to notice any breast changes and visit their doctor promptly. Study characteristics   A search for trials investigating interventions on breast cancer awareness in women was run in January 2016. We found two trials with a total of 997 women. The Promoting Early Presentation (PEP) study, funded by Breast Cancer UK, involved randomising 867 women to receive one of three interventions: (1) a written booklet and usual care, (2) a written booklet and usual care plus one‐to‐one discussion with a healthcare professional or (3) usual care only. Women were aged between 67 to 70 years and recruited into the study at breast cancer screening units in the UK. The Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS) study involved randomising 130 women into two groups that received either: (1) an educational programme using written and oral materials that focused on ""breast cancer preventive behaviours"" (e.g. having a healthy diet and positive beliefs towards breast self‐examining behaviour) or (2) no intervention. Women were employed at ZUMS and aged between 35 and 39 years. Key outcomes   Study outcomes were measured differently in the two studies. The PEP study assessed outcomes at one month, one year and two years after the intervention. The ZUMS study measured outcomes at one month after the intervention. Since the studies were very different in terms of the participants' age, interventions, outcomes and time points measured, the results are reported separately. Knowledge of breast cancer symptoms   In PEP: women's knowledge of breast cancer symptoms seemed to somewhat improve after receiving either the written booklet or written booklet plus verbal interaction. These results improved when compared to usual care at 2 years postintervention. In ZUMS: women’s awareness of breast cancer symptoms increased one month after the educational programme.    Knowledge of age‐related risk of breast cancer   In PEP: knowledge of age‐related risk increased for women who had received a written booklet and interacted with a healthcare professional compared to usual care at 2 years postintervention. For women who only received the booklet, there was less of a comparable increase in knowledge. In ZUMS: this study only measured if women perceived themselves to be at risk of getting breast cancer. This self‐perception of risk did increase at one month following the intervention. Self‐reported breast checking   In PEP: women's reported monthly breast checking increased, but not significantly, at 2 years postintervention compared to usual care. In ZUMS: women's reported ""breast cancer preventive behaviours"" increased one month after the intervention. Specifically, this refers to their positive beliefs towards breast self‐examining behaviour. Overall breast cancer awareness   In PEP: women's breast cancer awareness overall did not change after receiving a booklet alone compared to usual care at 2 years after the intervention. However, breast cancer awareness increased in women who had received a written booklet and interacted with a healthcare professional. This behaviour change was in comparison to usual care at 2 years postintervention. In ZUMS: women's ""breast cancer preventive behaviours"" were reported to increase at one month. None of the studies reported on other parts of breast awareness, the intention to seek help, quality of life, adverse effects of the interventions, or breast cancer‐related outcomes.    Quality of the evidence   The evidence was considered to be moderate quality in the PEP study and low quality in the ZUMS study. Neither study clearly defined ‘breast cancer awareness’. The lack of high quality studies limited our ability to draw conclusions. However, the PEP study results suggest that combining written information and a one‐to‐one discussion had a long‐term effect on increasing women’s breast cancer awareness. In the future, studies should use larger samples and follow the women for a longer time.",CD011396
"Background Hordeolum is an acute, purulent inflammation of the eyelid margin usually caused by obstructed orifices of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid. The condition, which affects sebaceous glands internally or externally, is common. When the meibomian gland in the tarsal plate is affected, internal hordeolum occurs, while when the glands of Zeis or Moll associated with eyelash follicles are affected, external hordeolum, or stye occurs. The onset of hordeolum is usually self limited, and may resolve in about a week with spontaneous drainage of the abscess. When the condition is severe, it can spread to adjacent glands and tissues. Recurrences are very common. As long as an internal hordeolum remains unresolved, it can develop into a chalazion or generalized eyelid cellulitis. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy aimed to treat disease by using fine needles to stimulate specific points on the body. However, it is unclear if acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for acute hordeolum. Objectives The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other active treatment. We also compared the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus another treatment with that treatment alone. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), three major Chinese databases, as well as clinical trial registers all through 7 June 2016. We reviewed the reference lists from potentially eligible studies to identify additional randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We included RCTs of people diagnosed with acute internal or external hordeola. We included RCTs comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment, other active treatments, or comparing acupuncture plus another treatment versus another treatment alone. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures used by Cochrane. Main results We included 6 RCTs with a total of 531 participants from China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 18 to 28 years. Four RCTs included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum with a duration of less than seven days; one RCT included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum without specifying the duration; and one RCT included participants with recurrent acute hordeolum with a mean duration of 24 days. About 55% (291/531) of participants were women. Three RCTs included participants with either external or internal hordeolum; one RCT included participants with only external hordeolum; and two RCTs did not specify the type of hordeolum. Follow‐up was no more than seven days after treatment in all included RCTs; no data were available for long‐term outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low, and we judged all RCTs to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional treatments. We did not pool the data from these RCTs because the conventional treatments were not similar among trials. Two trials showed that resolution of acute hordeolum was more likely in the acupuncture group when compared with topical antibiotics (1 RCT; 32 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.70; low‐certainty of evidence) or oral antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 120 participants; RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.78; low‐certainty of evidence). In the third trial, little or no difference in resolution of hordeolum was observed when acupuncture was compared with topical antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 109 participants; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; low‐certainty of evidence). One RCT mentioned adverse outcomes, stating that there was no adverse event associated with acupuncture. Three RCTs compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments (two RCTs used topical antibiotics and warm compresses, one RCT used topical antibiotics only) versus the conventional treatments alone. One of the three RCTs, with very low‐certainty evidence, did not report the resolution of acute hordeolum; however, it reported that acute hordeolum relief might be higher when acupuncture was combined with conventional treatments than with conventional treatments alone group (60 participants; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.23). Pooled analysis of the remaining two RCTs, with low‐certainty evidence, estimated resolution of acute hordeolum was slightly higher in the combined treatment group compared with the conventional treatment alone group at 7‐day follow‐up (210 participants; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23; I 2  = 0%). None of the three RCTs reported adverse outcomes. Among the included RCTs, four participants, two from the acupuncture plus conventional treatments group and two from the conventional treatments alone group, withdrew due to exacerbation of symptoms. Authors' conclusions Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture with or without conventional treatments may provide short‐term benefits for treating acute hordeolum when compared with conventional treatments alone. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate allocation concealment, lack of masking of the outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear randomization method, and a high or unreported number of dropouts. All RCTs were conducted in China, which may limit their generalizability to non‐Chinese populations. Because no RCTs included a valid sham acupuncture control, we cannot rule out a potential expectation/placebo effect associated with acupuncture. As resolution is based on clinical observation, the outcome could be influenced by the observer's knowledge of the assigned treatment. Adverse effects of acupuncture were reported sparsely in the included RCTs, and, when reported, were rare. RCTs with better methodology, longer follow‐up, and which are conducted among other populations are warranted to provide more general evidence regarding the benefit of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum.","Acupuncture for acute hordeolum (stye) What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane review was to compare the benefits and harms of acupuncture versus conventional treatments used for treating acute hordeolum (stye). Key messages  Acupuncture, either alone or alongside conventional treatments, may increase the chance of hordeolum getting better (low‐certainty evidence). There is a lack of information on adverse effects. Studies that have a longer follow‐up and a more diverse study population are needed to tell if acupuncture really is a beneficial treatment. What was studied in this review?  Hordeolum the medical name for a stye. It is a small painful lump, or abscess, on the inside or outside of the eyelid. Typically, hordeolum goes away on its own within a week or so. However, serious cases of hordeolum can infect nearby tissues and glands. This infection can result in serious eyelid conditions. Common treatments for hordeolum include warm compresses applied at home, available over‐the‐counter topical medications and lid scrubs, antibiotics or steroids, lid massages, and other treatments. In East Asian countries, acupuncture is used to treat hordeolum, either alone or alongside these conventional treatments. According to the philosophy of traditional Chinese acupuncture, energy circulates in ‘meridians’ (or channels) through the body. When the meridian energy circulation is blocked by pathogenic factors, pain or ill health occurs. The way to restore health is to use fine needles to stimulate the appropriate acupuncture points in the body. The purpose of this review was to compare acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or conventional treatment to determine which treatment works best for acute hordeolum. What are the main results of the review?  We found six studies from China, including a total of 531 people. The follow‐up was no more than seven days after treatment. Three studies compared acupuncture with different conventional treatments and three studies compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments versus conventional treatments alone. The review showed that: • Acupuncture may increase the chance of the hordeolum getting better compared with using antibiotics and/or warm compresses (low‐certainty evidence). • Acupuncture combined with antibiotics and/or warm compresses compared with antibiotics and/or warm compresses may slightly increase the chance of the hordeolum getting better (low‐certainty evidence). • It is uncertain whether there are any harmful effects of acupuncture for hordeolum. How up‐to‐date is this review?  Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 7 June 2016.",CD011075
"Background Some clinicians believe that routine episiotomy, a surgical cut of the vagina and perineum, will prevent serious tears during childbirth. On the other hand, an episiotomy guarantees perineal trauma and sutures. Objectives To assess the effects on mother and baby of a policy of selective episiotomy ('only if needed') compared with a policy of routine episiotomy ('part of routine management') for vaginal births. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing selective versus routine use of episiotomy, irrespective of parity, setting or surgical type of episiotomy. We included trials where either unassisted or assisted vaginal births were intended. Quasi‐RCTs, trials using a cross‐over design or those published in abstract form only were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A third author mediated where there was no clear consensus. We observed good practice for data analysis and interpretation where trialists were review authors. We used fixed‐effect models unless heterogeneity precluded this, expressed results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results This updated review includes 12 studies (6177 women), 11 in women in labour for whom a vaginal birth was intended, and one in women where an assisted birth was anticipated. Two were trials each with more than 1000 women (Argentina and the UK), and the rest were smaller (from Canada, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan, Columbia and Saudi Arabia). Eight trials included primiparous women only, and four trials were in both primiparous and multiparous women. For risk of bias, allocation was adequately concealed and reported in nine trials; sequence generation random and adequately reported in three trials; blinding of outcomes adequate and reported in one trial, blinding of participants and personnel reported in one trial. For women where an unassisted vaginal birth was anticipated, a policy of selective episiotomy may result in 30% fewer women experiencing  severe perineal/vaginal trauma  (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94; 5375 women; eight RCTs; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference for  blood loss at delivery  (an average of 27 mL less with selective episiotomy, 95% CI from 75 mL less to 20 mL more; two trials, 336 women, very low‐certainty evidence). Both selective and routine episiotomy have little or no effect on infants with  Apgar score less than seven at five minutes  (four trials, no events; 3908 women, moderate‐certainty evidence );  and there may be little or no difference in  perineal infection  (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.82, three trials, 1467 participants, low‐certainty evidence). For pain, we do not know if selective episiotomy compared with routine results in fewer women with  moderate or severe perineal pain  (measured on a visual analogue scale) at three days postpartum (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05, one trial, 165 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference for  long‐term (six months or more) dyspareunia  (RR1.14, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.53, three trials, 1107 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence); and there may be little or no difference for  long‐term (six months or more) urinary incontinence  (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.44, three trials, 1107 participants, low‐certainty evidence ).  One trial reported  genital prolapse  at three years postpartum. There was no clear difference between the two groups (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.41; 365 women; one trial, low certainty evidence). Other outcomes relating to  long‐term effects  were not reported (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence). Subgroup analyses by parity (primiparae versus multiparae) and by surgical method (midline versus mediolateral episiotomy) did not identify any modifying effects. Pain was not well assessed, and women's preferences were not reported. One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women where an operative vaginal delivery was intended in 175 women, and did not show clear difference on severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy, but the analysis was underpowered. Authors' conclusions In women where no instrumental delivery is intended, selective episiotomy policies result in fewer women with severe perineal/vaginal trauma. Other findings, both in the short or long term, provide no clear evidence that selective episiotomy policies results in harm to mother or baby. The review thus demonstrates that believing that routine episiotomy reduces perineal/vaginal trauma is not justified by current evidence. Further research in women where instrumental delivery is intended may help clarify if routine episiotomy is useful in this particular group. These trials should use better, standardised outcome assessment methods.","Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth What is the issue? Normal birth can cause tears to the vagina and the surrounding tissue, usually as the baby's head is born, and sometimes these tears extend to the rectum. These are repaired surgically, but take time to heal. To avoid these severe tears, doctors have recommended making a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or scalpel to prevent severe tearing and facilitate the birth. This intervention, known as an episiotomy, is used as a routine care policy during births in some countries. Both a tear and an episiotomy need sutures, and can result in severe pain, bleeding, infection, pain with sex, and can contribute to long term urinary incontinence. Why is this important? An episiotomy requires suturing and benefits and harms as part of routine management of normal births remains unclear. In particular, we need to know if it does indeed prevent large tears, because women otherwise may be subjected to an unnecessary operation, pain and in some cases long‐term problems. The question of whether to apply a policy of routine episiotomy is important for clinical practice and for the health and well‐being of women and babies. What evidence did we find? We prepared this edition of this review by updating the methods and searching for evidence from the medical literature on 14 September 2016. The review now includes 11 randomised controlled trials (with 5977 women) that compared episiotomy as needed (selective episiotomy) with routine episiotomy in terms of benefits and harms for mother and baby in women at low risk of instrumental delivery. The trials were from ten different countries. In women where health staff were only conducting selective episiotomy, there may be 30% fewer with severe perineal trauma at birth compared with women where a policy of routine episiotomy was applied (eight trials, 5375 women, low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in average blood loss between the groups (two trials, very low‐certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in Apgar less than seven at five minutes, with no events in either groups (moderate‐certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in the number of women with moderate or severe perineal pain three days after giving birth (one trial, 165 women, very low‐certainty evidence) but careful assessment of women's pain was not well carried out in the included trials. There may be little or no difference in the number of women developing perineal infection (two trials, low‐certainty evidence); and there is probably little or no difference in women reporting painful sexual intercourse six months or more after delivery (three trials, 1107 women, moderate‐certainty evidence); for urinary incontinence six months or more after delivery, there may be little or no difference between the groups. One study reported genital prolapse three years after the birth and there was no clear difference between groups (low‐certainty evidence). Other important outcomes relating to long‐term effects were not reported in these trials (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence). One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women for whom an operative vaginal birth was intended. The results showed no clear difference in severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy. Women's views on the different policies were not reported. What does this mean? Overall, the findings show that selective use of episiotomy in women (where a normal delivery without forceps is anticipated) means that fewer women have severe perineal trauma. Thus the rationale for conducting routine episiotomies to prevent severe perineal trauma is not justified by current evidence, and we could not identify any benefits of routine episiotomy for the baby or the mother. More research is needed in order to inform policy in women where an instrumental birth is planned and episiotomy is often advocated. Outcomes could be better standardised and measured.",CD000081
"Background Dementia is a collective name for different degenerative brain syndromes which, according to Alzheimer's Disease International, affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide. The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. At the same time, there is growing literature that highlights the capacity of the arts and embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus, may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement). Search methods Searches took place up to March 2016 through ALOIS, Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement’s Specialized Register, which covers CENTRAL, a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers, and grey literature sources. We checked bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, and contacted professional associations, educational programmes and experts from around the world. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, including cross‐over design and cluster‐RCTs for inclusion. Studies considered had to include people with dementia, in any age group and in any setting, with interventions delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. Data collection and analysis The two review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Main results Of the 102 studies identified through electronic searches and personal communication, after de‐duplication we screened 80 at title/abstract level. We then reviewed 19 full papers, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Although three studies mentioned dance movement therapy as their intervention, they were excluded because they were not delivered by a qualified dance movement therapy practitioner. As a result, no studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia.","Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence Why is this review important? Dementia currently affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide and there is an expectation that, as people are growing older, there will be a substantial increase in the number of people affected. Dementia literature argues for the need to address the complexity of the symptoms and work with the person as a whole. It is possible that dance movement therapy, an embodied psychological intervention that uses movement and dance to express and explore emotions, may be useful for people with dementia. However, its effectiveness remains unclear. This is the first review of the effectiveness of dance movement therapy for dementia and will add to the evidence base regarding available non‐pharmacological interventions for dementia. Who might be interested in this review? It is expected that this review will be of interest to people affected by dementia and their carers as well as general practitioners, mental health professionals and psychological therapists. What questions does this review aim to answer? We asked the following questions. Is dance movement therapy more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is dance movement therapy more effective than any other treatment? How effective are different types of dance movement therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of dance movement therapy for dementia up to March 2016, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. No study met the inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was no evidence for or against dance movement therapy as a useful intervention for dementia. What should happen next? Well‐designed studies with a large number of participants and well‐defined interventions are needed before we are clear on whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia or not.",CD011022
"Background Proper sedation for neonates undergoing uncomfortable procedures may reduce stress and avoid complications. Midazolam is a short‐acting benzodiazepine that is used increasingly in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, its effectiveness as a sedative in neonates has not been systematically evaluated. Objectives Primary objecive To assess the effectiveness of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation, as evaluated by behavioural and/or physiological measurements of sedation levels, in critically ill neonates in the NICU. Secondary objectives To assess effects of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation on complications including the following. 1. Incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)/periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). 2. Mortality. 3. Occurrence of adverse effects associated with the use of midazolam (hypotension, neurological abnormalities). 4. Days of ventilation. 5. Days of supplemental oxygen. 6. Incidence of pneumothorax. 7. Length of NICU stay (days). 8. Long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 June 2016), Embase (1980 to 16 June 2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 16 June 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials . Selection criteria We selected for review randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation in infants aged 28 days or younger. Data collection and analysis We abstracted data regarding the primary outcome of level of sedation. We assessed secondary outcomes such as intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, death, length of NICU stay and adverse effects associated with midazolam. When appropriate, we performed meta‐analyses using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs), and if the RD was statistically significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for categorical variables, and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. We assessed heterogeneity by performing the I‐squared (I 2 ) test. Main results We included in the review three trials enrolling 148 neonates. We identified no new trials for this update. Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group. However, none of the sedation scales used have been validated in preterm infants; therefore, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of midazolam in this population. Duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the midazolam group than in the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95% CI 0.40 to 10.5; I 2  = 0%; two studies, 89 infants). One study (43 infants) reported significantly lower Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores during midazolam infusion than during dextrose (placebo) infusion (MD ‐3.80, 95% CI ‐5.93 to ‐1.67). Another study (46 infants) observed a higher incidence of adverse neurological events at 28 days' postnatal age (death, grade III or IV IVH or PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the morphine group (RR 7.64, 95% CI 1.02 to 57.21; RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 14) (tests for heterogeneity not applicable). We considered these trials to be of moderate quality according to GRADE assessment based on the following outcomes: mortality during hospital stay, length of NICU stay, adequacy of analgesia according to PIPP scores and poor neurological outcomes by 28 days' postnatal age. Authors' conclusions Data are insufficient to promote the use of intravenous midazolam infusion as a sedative for neonates undergoing intensive care. This review raises concerns about the safety of midazolam in neonates. Further research on the effectiveness and safety of midazolam in neonates is needed.","Intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit Review question:  For sick babies admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), how effective is midazolam, given by continuous intravenous drip, as a sedative for reducing stress, as measured by changes in behaviour and vital signs? Background:  Proper sedation for babies undergoing uncomfortable procedures while receiving intensive care may reduce stress and avoid complications. Midazolam is a sedative that is used increasingly in NICUs. However, researchers have not systematically reviewed the evidence to see if it is effective and safe for babies in this setting. Study characteristics:  We have selected for inclusion in this review randomised controlled trials of continuous intravenous drip of midazolam as a sedative in babies aged 28 days or younger. Key results:  We included three clinical trials in this review. Using different scales to measure level of sedation, each study showed that midazolam was effective in providing sedation to babies. However, the validity of the sedation scales used in these studies has not been proven in babies; therefore, we cannot be certain that midazolam is, in fact, an effective sedative for babies. Moreover, one study showed that babies who received midazolam had a significantly higher risk of death or brain injury, and combined results of two studies showed that midazolam use may prolong length of stay in the NICU. Industry:  One of the studies included in this review received support from industry, and for the other two studies, industry provided all study drugs. Quality of evidence:  We assessed the quality of the evidence on the outcomes of mortality during hospital stay, length of stay in the NICU, pain, and neurological outcomes at 28 days of life and found the evidence to be of moderate quality, as there was not enough evidence available. Therefore, we conclude there is not enough evidence to support the use of midazolam as a sedative for babies undergoing intensive care. Additional research is needed to address the safety and effectiveness of midazolam in this population.",CD002052
"Background Women with a septate uterus are at increased risk for subfertility, recurrent miscarriage, and preterm birth. Restoration of the anatomy of the uterus by hysteroscopic septum resection is an established intervention. This treatment has been assessed mainly in retrospective cohort studies, which suggested a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. The major flaw in these studies is the before/after design, which will always favour the tested intervention. Objectives To determine whether hysteroscopic septum resection in women of reproductive age with a septate uterus improves live birth rates and to assess the safety of this procedure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (inception to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL CRSO) (inception to May 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), PsycINFO (1806 to May 2016), and CINAHL database (1982 to May 2016). We also searched trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, reference lists, the Cochrane Library, unpublished dissertations and theses, conference abstracts, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed, and Google. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect on reproductive outcomes and the safety of hysteroscopic septum resection in women of reproductive age with a septate uterus. Data collection and analysis If there had been studies to include, two review authors would have independently selected studies, assessed trial risk of bias, and extracted data. They would also have contacted study authors for additional information. Main results As in the 2011 version of this review, we identified no randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this update. Authors' conclusions Hysteroscopic septum resection in women of reproductive age with a septate uterus is performed worldwide to improve reproductive outcomes. At present, there is no evidence to support the surgical procedure in these women. Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed. Two trials are currently underway.","Septum resection for women of childbearing age with a septate uterus Review question Cochrane authors wanted to know whether hysteroscopic septum resection (surgical removal of the septum) improves the chances of a live birth in women with a septate uterus, and whether these benefits outweigh the possible complications of the procedure. Background A septate uterus is an inborn abnormality of the uterus (womb), where the womb is divided into two cavities. Women with a septate uterus are at risk for subfertility, recurrent miscarriage, and preterm birth. Surgical removal of the septum is thought to improve these outcomes, but the effectiveness of this surgical procedure is unknown. Study characteristics We examined the research published up to May 2016. Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect on reproductive outcomes of hysteroscopic septum resection in women of childbearing age with a septate uterus were eligible for inclusion. In these trials, women would be randomised to either septum resection or expectant management (no surgery). There were no studies to include so we cannot report on funding sources. Key results As in the 2011 version of this review, we identified no published randomised controlled trials to include in this update.",CD008576
"Background Non‐specific low back pain is a common, potentially disabling condition usually treated with self‐care and non‐prescription medication. For chronic low back pain, current guidelines state that exercise therapy may be beneficial. Yoga is a mind‐body exercise sometimes used for non‐specific low back pain. Objectives To assess the effects of yoga for treating chronic non‐specific low back pain, compared to no specific treatment, a minimal intervention (e.g. education), or another active treatment, with a focus on pain, function, and adverse events. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and four trials registers to 11 March 2016 without restriction of language or publication status. We screened reference lists and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials of yoga treatment in people with chronic non‐specific low back pain. We included studies comparing yoga to any other intervention or to no intervention. We also included studies comparing yoga as an adjunct to other therapies, versus those other therapies alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted outcome data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to obtain missing or unclear information. We evaluated the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 12 trials (1080 participants) carried out in the USA (seven trials), India (three trials), and the UK (two trials). Studies were unfunded (one trial), funded by a yoga institution (one trial), funded by non‐profit or government sources (seven trials), or did not report on funding (three trials). Most trials used Iyengar, Hatha, or Viniyoga forms of yoga. The trials compared yoga to no intervention or a non‐exercise intervention such as education (seven trials), an exercise intervention (three trials), or both exercise and non‐exercise interventions (two trials). All trials were at high risk of performance and detection bias because participants and providers were not blinded to treatment assignment, and outcomes were self‐assessed. Therefore, we downgraded all outcomes to 'moderate' certainty evidence because of risk of bias, and when there was additional serious risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity between studies, or the analyses were imprecise, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence further. For yoga compared to non‐exercise controls (9 trials; 810 participants), there was low‐certainty evidence that yoga produced small to moderate improvements in back‐related function at three to four months (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.14; corresponding to a change in the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire of mean difference (MD) ‐2.18, 95% ‐3.60 to ‐0.76), moderate‐certainty evidence for small to moderate improvements at six months (SMD ‐0.44, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.22; corresponding to a change in the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD ‐2.15, 95% ‐3.23 to ‐1.08), and low‐certainty evidence for small improvements at 12 months (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.05; corresponding to a change in the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD ‐1.36, 95% ‐2.41 to ‐0.26). On a 0‐100 scale there was very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that yoga was slightly better for pain at three to four months (MD ‐4.55, 95% CI ‐7.04 to ‐2.06), six months (MD ‐7.81, 95% CI ‐13.37 to ‐2.25), and 12 months (MD ‐5.40, 95% CI ‐14.50 to ‐3.70), however we pre‐defined clinically significant changes in pain as 15 points or greater and this threshold was not met. Based on information from six trials, there was moderate‐certainty evidence that the risk of adverse events, primarily increased back pain, was higher in yoga than in non‐exercise controls (risk difference (RD) 5%, 95% CI 2% to 8%). For yoga compared to non‐yoga exercise controls (4 trials; 394 participants), there was very‐low‐certainty evidence for little or no difference in back‐related function at three months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.65 to 0.20; corresponding to a change in the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD ‐0.99, 95% ‐2.87 to 0.90) and six months (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.19; corresponding to a change in the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire of MD ‐0.90, 95% ‐2.61 to 0.81), and no information on back‐related function after six months. There was very low‐certainty evidence for lower pain on a 0‐100 scale at seven months (MD ‐20.40, 95% CI ‐25.48 to ‐15.32), and no information on pain at three months or after seven months. Based on information from three trials, there was low‐certainty evidence for no difference in the risk of adverse events between yoga and non‐yoga exercise controls (RD 1%, 95% CI ‐4% to 6%). For yoga added to exercise compared to exercise alone (1 trial; 24 participants), there was very‐low‐certainty evidence for little or no difference at 10 weeks in back‐related function (SMD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.42 to 0.22; corresponding to a change in the Oswestry Disability Index of MD ‐17.05, 95% ‐22.96 to 11.14) or pain on a 0‐100 scale (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐13.76 to 7.36). There was no information on outcomes at other time points. There was no information on adverse events. Studies provided limited evidence on risk of clinical improvement, measures of quality of life, and depression. There was no evidence on work‐related disability. Authors' conclusions There is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that yoga compared to non‐exercise controls results in small to moderate improvements in back‐related function at three and six months. Yoga may also be slightly more effective for pain at three and six months, however the effect size did not meet predefined levels of minimum clinical importance. It is uncertain whether there is any difference between yoga and other exercise for back‐related function or pain, or whether yoga added to exercise is more effective than exercise alone. Yoga is associated with more adverse events than non‐exercise controls, but may have the same risk of adverse events as other back‐focused exercise. Yoga is not associated with serious adverse events. There is a need for additional high‐quality research to improve confidence in estimates of effect, to evaluate long‐term outcomes, and to provide additional information on comparisons between yoga and other exercise for chronic non‐specific low back pain.","Yoga treatment for chronic non‐specific low back pain Review question Does yoga improve back‐related function and pain in people with chronic non‐specific low back pain? Background Low back pain is a common health problem. For some people, it may last for three months or more and at this point it is termed 'chronic'. Yoga is sometimes used as a treatment for low back pain. Search date We searched medical databases for trials comparing yoga to any other treatment or to no treatment in adults (aged 18 years or greater). We also included trials comparing yoga added to other treatments, versus those other treatments alone. The evidence is current to March 2016. Study characteristics We included 12 trials with 1080 participants. Seven studies were carried out in the USA, three studies were carried out in India, and two studies were carried out in the UK. All studies measured changes in back‐related function or pain. Few studies reported on quality of life or depression, and only about half of the studies said anything about harms. Study funding sources Three studies did not report the source of funding. One study reported not receiving any funding; one study was funded by a yoga institution; and seven studies were funded by charity, university, or government sources. Key results Seven studies compared yoga to non‐exercise, which included no treatment, delayed yoga treatment, or education (e.g. booklets and lectures). Three studies compared yoga to back‐focused exercise or similar exercise programmes. Two studies had three treatment groups and compared yoga, non‐exercise, and back‐focused exercise. One of the studies comparing yoga to back‐focused exercise compared yoga plus back‐focused exercise to back‐focused exercise alone. For yoga compared to non‐exercise, there was low‐certainty evidence that yoga was probably better in improving back function at three months, moderate‐certainty evidence that yoga was probably better at six months, and low‐certainty evidence that yoga was probably slightly better at 12 months. There was very‐low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence for an improvement in pain at three, six, and 12 months, but the effects were not clinically important. For yoga compared to back‐focused exercise, there was very‐low‐certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between yoga and non‐yoga exercise in improving back function at three and six months and no information on back function at 12 months, there was very‐low‐certainty evidence for an improvement in pain at seven months, and there was no information on pain at three or 12 months. For yoga plus back‐focused exercise compared to back‐focused exercise alone, there was very‐low‐certainty evidence from one study (24 participants) and it is uncertain whether yoga added to exercise was better than exercise alone for back function or pain at 10 weeks. Back function and pain were not measured after 10 weeks. The most common harms reported in the trials were increased back pain. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that the risk of harms was higher in yoga than in non‐exercise, and low‐certainty that the risk of harms was similar between yoga and back‐focused exercise. Yoga was not associated with a risk of serious adverse events. There was little information on clinical improvement, quality of life and depression, and no evidence on work‐related disability. Certainty of the evidence Participants in all the studies were aware of whether they were practicing yoga or not, and this may have influenced their reporting of changes in functioning, pain, and other measures. . In addition, some studies were very small, there were few studies in some comparisons, and the studies in some comparisons had inconsistent results. Therefore, we graded the certainty of the evidence 'moderate', 'low', or 'very low'.",CD010671
"Background Inhaled short‐acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short‐acting beta₂‐agonists (SABA) are effective therapies for adult patients with acute asthma who present to the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, whether the combination of SAAC and SABA treatment is more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with SABA alone. Objectives To conduct an up‐to‐date systematic search and meta‐analysis on the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone to reduce hospitalisations in adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILACS, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and evidence‐based medicine (EBM) databases using controlled vocabulary, natural language terms, and a variety of specific and general terms for inhaled SAAC and SABA drugs. The search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. The Cochrane Airways Group provided search results from the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials which was most recently conducted in July 2016. An extensive search of the grey literature was completed to identify any other potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria Included studies were randomised or controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC and SABA) to SABA treatment alone to prevent hospitalisations in adults with acute asthma in the emergency department. Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐determined criteria. Data collection and analysis For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random‐effects model and reporting heterogeneity (I²). For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trial results using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random‐effects model. Main results We included 23 studies that involved a total of 2724 enrolled participants. Most studies were rated at unclear or high risk of bias. Overall, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I² = 12%; moderate quality of evidence). An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospitalisation after receiving combination therapy (95% 30 to 95), compared to 231 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Although combination inhaled therapy was more effective than SABA treatment alone in reducing hospitalisation in participants with severe asthma exacerbations, this was not found for participants with mild or moderate exacerbations (test for difference between subgroups P = 0.02). Participants receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6; I² = 70%; low quality of evidence), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (MD 36.58 L/min, 95% CI 23.07 to 50.09; participants = 1056; studies = 12; I² = 25%; very low quality of evidence), increased percent change in PEF from baseline (MD 24.88, 95% CI 14.83 to 34.93; participants = 551; studies = 7; I² = 23%; moderate quality of evidence), and were less likely to return to the ED for additional care (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 1180; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) than participants receiving SABA alone. Participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those treated with SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I² = 14%; moderate quality of evidence). Among patients receiving combination therapy, 103 per 1000 were likely to report adverse events (95% 31 to 195 more) compared to 131 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Authors' conclusions Overall, combination inhaled therapy with SAAC and SABA reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In particular, combination inhaled therapy was more effective in preventing hospitalisation in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation, compared to those with mild‐moderate exacerbations, who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised. A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed reductions in the risk of hospitalisation among adults with acute asthma. However, adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience adverse events, such as tremor, agitation, and palpitations, compared to patients receiving SABA alone.","Combined beta‐agonists and anticholinergics compared to beta‐agonists alone for adults with asthma treated in emergency departments Review question We looked at if combined treatment of short‐acting beta‐agonists and anticholinergics were more effective to improve outcomes in adults with asthma who were treated in emergency departments compared to treatment with beta‐agonists alone. Background Asthma attacks result from airway passages to the lungs becoming constricted due to inflammation, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. People experiencing asthma attacks often go to emergency departments, and are usually treated using short‐acting inhaled beta‐agonists, although some patients may be treated with short‐acting inhaled anticholinergics. Some research looks at whether treating people with asthma in emergency departments with a combination of beta‐agonists and anticholinergics is more effective than beta‐agonists alone. Search date The search was current to July 2016. Study characteristics We included 23 studies that compared the effectiveness of combined treatment with beta‐agonists and anticholinergics versus treatment with beta‐agonists alone. A total of 2724 adult participants were enrolled in the studies. Salbutamol (also called albuterol) was the most common beta‐agonist investigated and ipratropium bromide was the most common anticholinergic assessed. Study fundin g sources We found that most studies did not report sources of funding (14 studies); one study was supported by a hospital; another received support from a pharmaceutical company, but indicated that there was no involvement from the company in conducting or reporting research. Two studies were part‐funded and four were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Key results Patients with severe asthma who received combined treatment of beta‐agonists and anticholinergics were less likely to be admitted to hospital. An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospital admission after receiving combined inhaled therapy in the emergency department. Among patients with mild ‐to‐moderate asthma, combined inhaled therapy was less effective in preventing admission to hospital compared with people with severe asthma. Patients receiving combined treatment were less likely to return to the emergency department with worsening asthma symptoms and had better outcomes in most lung function tests. On the other hand, 103 more participants per 1000 who receive combined inhaled therapy would experience side effects compared to people who receive beta‐agonists alone. Quality of the evidence Quality of the evidence that combination inhaled therapy can improve health outcomes compared to treatment with beta‐agonists alone ranged from very low to moderate. Our confidence about the effects of combination inhaled therapy on hospital admissions, peak expiratory flow, percent change in peak expiratory flow from baseline, and relapse was moderate because of the overall risk of bias among included studies. Factors associated with inconsistency and imprecision were additional aspects that reduced the quality of the evidence for forced expiratory volume in one second, and percent predicted peak expiratory flow.",CD001284
"Background Prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) at term is managed expectantly or by planned early birth. It is not clear if waiting for birth to occur spontaneously is better than intervening, e.g. by inducing labour. Objectives The objective of this review is to assess the effects of planned early birth (immediate intervention or intervention within 24 hours) when compared with expectant management (no planned intervention within 24 hours) for women with term PROM on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (9 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of planned early birth compared with expectant management (either in hospital or at home) in women with PROM at 37 weeks' gestation or later. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results Twenty‐three trials involving 8615 women and their babies were included in the update of this review. Ten trials assessed intravenous oxytocin; 12 trials assessed prostaglandins (six trials in the form of vaginal prostaglandin E2 and six as oral, sublingual or vaginal misoprostol); and one trial each assessed  Caulophyllum  and acupuncture. Overall, three trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, while the other 20 were at unclear or high risk of bias. Primary outcomes: women who had planned early birth were at a reduced risk of  maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis)  than women who had expectant management following term prelabour rupture of membranes (average risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.72; eight trials, 6864 women; Tau² = 0.19; I² = 72%;  low‐quality evidence ), and their neonates were less likely to have  definite or probable early‐onset neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92; 16 trials, 7314 infants; low‐quality evidence ). No clear differences between the planned early birth and expectant management groups were seen for the risk of  caesarean section  (average RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.04; 23 trials, 8576 women; Tau² = 0.10; I² = 55%;  low‐quality evidence );  serious maternal morbidity or mortality  (no events; three trials; 425 women;  very low‐quality evidence );  definite early‐onset neonatal sepsis  (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.33; six trials, 1303 infants;  very low‐quality evidence ); or  perinatal mortality  (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.66; eight trials, 6392 infants;  moderate‐quality evidence ). Secondary outcomes: women who had a planned early birth were at a reduced risk of chorioamnionitis (average RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82; eight trials, 6874 women; Tau² = 0.19; I² = 73%), and postpartum septicaemia (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.96; three trials, 263 women), and their neonates were less likely to receive antibiotics (average RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84; 10 trials, 6427 infants; Tau² = 0.06; I² = 32%). Women in the planned early birth group were more likely to have their labour induced (average RR 3.41; 95% CI 2.87 to 4.06; 12 trials, 6945 women; Tau² = 0.05; I² = 71%), had a shorter time from rupture of membranes to birth (mean difference (MD) ‐10.10 hours; 95% CI ‐12.15 to ‐8.06; nine trials, 1484 women; Tau² = 5.81; I² = 60%), and their neonates had lower birthweights (MD ‐79.25 g; 95% CI ‐124.96 to ‐33.55; five trials, 1043 infants). Women who had a planned early birth had a shorter length of hospitalisation (MD ‐0.79 days; 95% CI ‐1.20 to ‐0.38; two trials, 748 women; Tau² = 0.05; I² = 59%), and their neonates were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal special or intensive care unit (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.85; eight trials, 6179 infants), and had a shorter duration of hospital (‐11.00 hours; 95% CI ‐21.96 to ‐0.04; one trial, 182 infants) or special or intensive care unit stay (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; four trials, 5691 infants). Women in the planned early birth group had more positive experiences compared with women in the expectant management group. No clear differences between groups were observed for endometritis; postpartum pyrexia; postpartum antibiotic usage; caesarean for fetal distress; operative vaginal birth; uterine rupture; epidural analgesia; postpartum haemorrhage; adverse effects; cord prolapse; stillbirth; neonatal mortality; pneumonia; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes; use of mechanical ventilation; or abnormality on cerebral ultrasound (no events). None of the trials reported on breastfeeding; postnatal depression; gestational age at birth; meningitis; respiratory distress syndrome; necrotising enterocolitis; neonatal encephalopathy; or disability at childhood follow‐up. In subgroup analyses, there were no clear patterns of differential effects for method of induction, parity, use of maternal antibiotic prophylaxis, or digital vaginal examination. Results of the sensitivity analyses based on trial quality were consistent with those of the main analysis, except for  definite or probable early‐onset neonatal sepsis  where no clear difference was observed. Authors' conclusions There is low quality evidence to suggest that planned early birth (with induction methods such as oxytocin or prostaglandins) reduces the risk of maternal infectious morbidity compared with expectant management for PROM at 37 weeks' gestation or later, without an apparent increased risk of caesarean section. Evidence was mainly downgraded due to the majority of studies contributing data having some serious design limitations, and for most outcomes estimates were imprecise. Although the 23 included trials in this review involved a large number of women and babies, the quality of the trials and evidence was not high overall, and there was limited reporting for a number of important outcomes. Thus further evidence assessing the benefits or harms of planned early birth compared with expectant management, considering maternal, fetal, neonatal and longer‐term childhood outcomes, and the use of health services, would be valuable. Any future trials should be adequately designed and powered to evaluate the effects on short‐ and long‐term outcomes. Standardisation of outcomes and their definitions, including for the assessment of maternal and neonatal infection, would be beneficial.","Is it better for a baby to be born immediately or to wait for labour to start spontaneously when waters break at or after 37 weeks? What is the issue? If a pregnant woman's waters break without onset of contractions (prelabour rupture of membranes – PROM) at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more, there are two options: the first is for induction of labour so that the baby is born as soon as possible (planned early birth); or secondly, to wait for labour to start naturally (expectant management). Why is this important? In a previous version of this review we found that planned early birth may reduce the risk of maternal infection without increasing the risk of caesarean section, compared with waiting. Fewer infants went to the neonatal intensive care unit with planned early birth, though there were no differences seen in rates of neonatal infection. While there are some benefits of early induction of labour, it is important to have a more complete picture of what happens with planned early birth compared with waiting for labour to start naturally. What evidence did we find? This review included data from 23 randomised controlled trials involving 8615 pregnant women at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more. Only three trials were at overall low risk of bias, and the evidence in the review was very low to moderate quality. For planned early birth, 10 trials used intravenous oxytocin for induction of labour, 12 trials used prostaglandins, and one trial each assessed  Caulophyllum  and acupuncture. The findings showed that planned early birth for PROM at term reduced the risk of infection for pregnant women (including infection of the membranes surrounding the baby and the amniotic fluid (known as chorioamnionitis)) compared with expectant management (eight trials, 6864 women; this was rated  low‐quality evidence ), Planned early birth also reduced the risk of definite or possible infections for the babies (16 trials, 7314 babies,  low‐quality evidenc e). However, no differences were seen in the rates of caesarean births (23 trials, 8576 women,  low‐quality evidence ), serious illness or death for the women (three trials, 425 women,  very low‐quality evidence ), definite infection for the babies (six trials, 1303 babies,  very low‐quality evidence ), or death for the babies (eight trials, 6392 babies,  moderate‐quality evidence ). Babies born after planned early birth were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (eight trials, 6179 babies), and both women (two trials, 748 women) and their babies (four trials, 5691 babies) had a shorter stay in hospital after planned early birth. Women had a more positive experience of planned early birth compared with expectant management (two trials, 5134 women). What does this mean? Planned early birth (compared with expectant management) after PROM at term may help to reduce infection for women without increasing the need for a caesarean section, and neonatal infection may also be reduced. However, evidence about longer‐term effects on children is needed.",CD005302
"Background Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in children aged four to 18 years and are a major cause of ill health. The school setting offers the opportunity to deliver preventive interventions to a large number of children and has been used to address a range of public health problems. However, the effectiveness of the school setting for the prevention of different injury mechanisms in school‐aged children is not well understood. Objectives To assess the effects of school‐based educational programmes for the prevention of injuries in children and evaluate their impact on improving children's safety skills, behaviour and practices, and knowledge, and assess their cost‐effectiveness. Search methods We ran searches on the following electronic databases to 26 June 2015: PsycINFO, British Education Index (BEI), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Sociological Abstracts; Latin America and the Caribbean database (LILACS), together with several sources of grey literature. The Cochrane Injuries Information Specialist ran searches, to August 2013, on the Groups Specialised Register (SR‐INJ), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane Library databases, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the ISI Web of Science. In keeping with Cochrane standards, along with Cochrane Injuries' Information Specialist we ran an update search prior to publication (September and October 2016). We have screened the results and placed any relevant studies in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification section of this review.These will be incorporated in the next version of this review, as appropriate. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (non‐RCTs), and controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies that evaluated school‐based educational programmes aimed at preventing a range of injury mechanisms. The primary outcome was self‐reported or medically attended unintentional (or unspecified intent) injuries and secondary outcomes were observed safety skills, observed behaviour, self‐reported behaviour and safety practices, safety knowledge, and health economic outcomes. The control groups received no intervention, a delayed injury‐prevention intervention or alternative school‐based curricular activities. We included studies that aimed interventions at primary or secondary prevention of injuries from more than one injury mechanism and were delivered, in part or in full, in schools catering for children aged four to 18 years. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors identified relevant trials from title and abstracts of studies identified in searches and two review authors extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias. We grouped different types of interventions according to the outcome assessed and the injury mechanism targeted. Where data permitted, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses to provide a summary of results across studies. Main results The review included 27 studies reported in 30 articles. The studies had 73,557 participants with 12 studies from the US; four from China; two from each of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the UK; and one from each of Israel, Greece and Brazil .  Thirteen studies were RCTs, six were non‐RCTs and eight were CBAs. Of the included studies, 18 provided some element of the intervention in children aged four to 11 years, 17 studies included children aged 11 to 14 years and nine studies included children aged 14 to 18 years. The overall quality of the results was poor, with the all studies assessed as being at high or unclear risks of bias across multiple domains, and varied interventions and data collection methods employed. Interventions comprised information‐giving, peer education or were multi‐component. Seven studies reported the primary outcome of injury occurrence and only three of these were similar enough to combine in a meta‐analysis, with a pooled incidence rate ratio of 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.08; 2073 children) and substantial statistical heterogeneity (I 2  = 63%). However, this body of evidence was low certainty, due to concerns over this heterogeneity (inconsistency) and imprecision. This heterogeneity may be explained by the non‐RCT study design of one of the studies, as a sensitivity analysis with this study removed found stronger evidence of an effect and no heterogeneity (I 2  = 0%). Two studies report an improvement in safety skills in the intervention group. Likewise, the four studies measuring observed safety behaviour reported an improvement in the intervention group relative to the control. Thirteen out of 19 studies describing self‐reported behaviour and safety practices showed improvements, and of the 21 studies assessing changes in safety knowledge, 19 reported an improvement in at least one question domain in the intervention compared to the control group. However, we were unable to pool data for our secondary outcomes, so our conclusions were limited, as they were drawn from highly diverse single studies and the body of evidence was low (safety skills) or very low (behaviour, safety knowledge) certainty. Only one study reported intervention costs but did not undertake a full economic evaluation (very low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine whether school‐based educational programmes can prevent unintentional injuries. More high‐quality studies are needed to evaluate the impact of educational programmes on injury occurrence. There is some weak evidence that such programmes improve safety skills, behaviour/practices and knowledge, although the evidence was of low or very low quality certainty. We found insufficient economic studies to assess cost‐effectiveness.","School‐based education programmes for the prevention of unintentional injuries in children and young people About the review question We looked at the evidence on the effects of programmes in schools that aimed to prevent accidental injuries in children and young people. Preventing injuries in children is important because injuries are common in this age group and the effects on the child and the family can be severe and long‐lasting. Schools are potentially a good setting within which to provide education programmes aimed at preventing such injuries occurring. However, it has not been examined in detail whether this works or not. We found 27 studies to help us address this question. Background We wanted to discover whether teaching children in school education about injury prevention resulted in them having fewer injuries, improved their knowledge about injury prevention and improved their behaviours in relation to safety. We also wanted to assess whether this type of approach was good value for money. Study characteristics The evidence is current to June 2015. It includes the results from 27 studies of 73,557 children. It included boys and girls aged four to 18. The studies compared injury prevention education with either the usual curriculum or an alternative programme unrelated to injuries. The studies we included were aimed at preventing a range of injuries. We excluded programmes that focused on just one cause of injury. The review measured the effects of the educational programmes on the occurrence of injuries in children, their safety skills, behaviour and knowledge. The review also looked at whether school‐based approaches are good value for money. Key results Only a few studies reported the effect on injury occurrence in children and so these effects were inconclusive. This does not mean that school‐based programmes are ineffective but rather that more evidence is needed. The review did find evidence that school‐based injury prevention education programmes can improve children's safety skills, safety behaviours and safety knowledge. However, the evidence was inconsistent, with some studies showing a positive effect and others showing no effect. Only one study reported on how cost‐effective school‐based programmes were and so again it is difficult to draw conclusions from this evidence alone. Quality of the evidence The studies were generally of poor quality for all the measurements of effectiveness of the programmes but particularly for behaviour and knowledge. This is because information about how the study was conducted was not usually reported very clearly in the study reports or there were major flaws in the way that the studies were undertaken. More research is needed that is of higher quality.",CD010246
"Background Stroke is a major cause of long‐term disability in adults. Several systematic reviews have shown that a higher intensity of training can lead to better functional outcomes after stroke. Currently, the resources in inpatient settings are not always sufficient and innovative methods are necessary to meet these recommendations without increasing healthcare costs. A resource efficient method to augment intensity of training could be to involve caregivers in exercise training. A caregiver‐mediated exercise programme has the potential to improve outcomes in terms of body function, activities, and participation in people with stroke. In addition, caregivers are more actively involved in the rehabilitation process, which may increase feelings of empowerment with reduced levels of caregiver burden and could facilitate the transition from rehabilitation facility (in hospital, rehabilitation centre, or nursing home) to home setting. As a consequence, length of stay might be reduced and early supported discharge could be enhanced. Objectives To determine if caregiver‐mediated exercises (CME) improve functional ability and health‐related quality of life in people with stroke, and to determine the effect on caregiver burden. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2015), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2015), Embase (1980 to December 2015), CINAHL (1982 to December 2015), SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2015), three additional databases (two in October 2015, one in December 2015), and six additional trial registers (October 2015). We also screened reference lists of relevant publications and contacted authors in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing CME to usual care, no intervention, or another intervention as long as it was not caregiver‐mediated, aimed at improving motor function in people who have had a stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials. One review author extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias, and a second review author cross‐checked these data and assessed quality. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE. The small number of included studies limited the pre‐planned analyses. Main results We included nine trials about CME, of which six trials with 333 patient‐caregiver couples were included in the meta‐analysis. The small number of studies, participants, and a variety of outcome measures rendered summarising and combining of data in meta‐analysis difficult. In addition, in some studies, CME was the only intervention (CME‐core), whereas in other studies, caregivers provided another, existing intervention, such as constraint‐induced movement therapy. For trials in the latter category, it was difficult to separate the effects of CME from the effects of the other intervention. We found no significant effect of CME on basic ADL when pooling all trial data post intervention (4 studies; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.02 to 0.44; P = 0.07; moderate‐quality evidence) or at follow‐up (2 studies; mean difference (MD) 2.69, 95% CI ‐8.18 to 13.55; P = 0.63; low‐quality evidence). In addition, we found no significant effects of CME on extended ADL at post intervention (two studies; SMD 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.35; P = 0.64; low‐quality evidence) or at follow‐up (2 studies; SMD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.39; P = 0.45; low‐quality evidence). Caregiver burden did not increase at the end of the intervention (2 studies; SMD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.37; P = 0.86; moderate‐quality evidence) or at follow‐up (1 study; MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐0.71 to 1.91; P = 0.37; very low‐quality evidence). At the end of intervention, CME significantly improved the secondary outcomes of standing balance (3 studies; SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; P = 0.002; low‐quality evidence) and quality of life (1 study; physical functioning: MD 12.40, 95% CI 1.67 to 23.13; P = 0.02; mobility: MD 18.20, 95% CI 7.54 to 28.86; P = 0.0008; general recovery: MD 15.10, 95% CI 8.44 to 21.76; P < 0.00001; very low‐quality evidence). At follow‐up, we found a significant effect in favour of CME for Six‐Minute Walking Test distance (1 study; MD 109.50 m, 95% CI 17.12 to 201.88; P = 0.02; very low‐quality evidence). We also found a significant effect in favour of the control group at the end of intervention, regarding performance time on the Wolf Motor Function test (2 studies; MD ‐1.72, 95% CI ‐2.23 to ‐1.21; P < 0.00001; low‐quality evidence). We found no significant effects for the other secondary outcomes (i.e. patient: motor impairment, upper limb function, mood, fatigue, length of stay and adverse events; caregiver: mood and quality of life). In contrast to the primary analysis, sensitivity analysis of CME‐core showed a significant effect of CME on basic ADL post intervention (2 studies; MD 9.45, 95% CI 2.11 to 16.78; P = 0.01; moderate‐quality evidence). The methodological quality of the included trials and variability in interventions (e.g. content, timing, and duration), affected the validity and generalisability of these observed results. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that CME may be a valuable intervention to augment the pallet of therapeutic options for stroke rehabilitation. Included studies were small, heterogeneous, and some trials had an unclear or high risk of bias. Future high‐quality research should determine whether CME interventions are (cost‐)effective.","Caregiver‐mediated exercises for improving outcomes after stroke Review question What is the effect of performing exercises with a caregiver after stroke on outcome for people with stroke and burden for caregivers? Background Stroke is a major cause of acquired adult disability. Research has shown that more time spent on exercise therapy in the first weeks to months after stroke leads to better functioning. Due to lack of personnel and resources, in practice it is difficult to spend more time on exercise therapy in this period. One method to increase this exercise time, is to involve caregivers in performing exercise training together with a person with stroke. During this exercise training a therapist coaches patient and caregiver and an evaluation is planned on a regular basis. Study characteristics We identified nine clinical trials to October 2015, which all investigated some form of caregiver‐mediated exercises compared with usual care, no treatment (intervention), or another intervention that was not caregiver‐mediated. Key results We included 333 patient‐caregiver couples in the review. We found trials in which caregiver‐mediated exercises themselves were the studied subject (called CME‐core). In addition, we found trials in which the caregiver was the provider of another, already existing intervention. In the latter category, it was difficult to separate the effect of caregiver‐mediated exercises from the effect of the other intervention. We found evidence that caregiver‐mediated exercises could have a positive effect on patients' standing balance (low‐quality evidence) and quality of life (very low‐quality evidence) directly after the intervention. In the long term, we found very low‐quality evidence for a positive effect on walking distance. For speed of use of the arm and hand, we found low‐quality evidence in favour of the control group. We found no significant side effects or beneficial effects on caregiver strain; we judged the quality of this evidence as moderate (after intervention) to very low (long term). Furthermore, we found no significant effects for basic activities of daily living, such as dressing and bathing, after intervention (moderate‐quality evidence) or follow‐up (low‐quality evidence). In addition, we found no significant effects for extended activities of daily living, such as cooking and gardening, after intervention or at follow‐up (both low‐quality evidence). In the CME‐core analysis, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a positive effect of caregiver‐mediated exercises for basic activities of daily living. It can be concluded that caregiver‐mediated exercises may be a promising form of therapy to add to usual care. Quality of the evidence The number of included trials was small and the level of evidence was of very low to moderate quality. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.",CD011058
"Background Acute diarrhoea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low‐income countries. Glucose‐based oral rehydration solution (ORS) helps replace fluid and prevent further dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Since 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the osmolarity of less than 270 mOsm/L (ORS ≤ 270) versus greater than 310 mOsm/L formulation (ORS ≥ 310). Polymer‐based ORS (for example, prepared using rice or wheat) slowly releases glucose and may be superior to glucose‐based ORS. Objectives To compare polymer‐based oral rehydration solution (polymer‐based ORS) with glucose‐based oral rehydration solution (glucose‐based ORS) for treating acute watery diarrhoea. Search methods We searched the following sources up to 5 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 5 September 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 5 September 2016), LILACS (1982 to 5 September 2016), and  m RCT (2007 to 5 September 2016). We also contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and searched reference lists. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with acute watery diarrhoea (cholera and non‐cholera associated) that compared polymer‐based and glucose‐based ORS (with identical electrolyte contents). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the search results and risk of bias, and extracted data. In multiple‐treatment arms with two or more treatment groups, we combined outcomes as appropriate and compared collectively with the control group. Main results Thirty‐five trials that included 4284 participants met the inclusion criteria: 28 trials exclusively included children, five included adults, and two included both adults and children. Polymer‐based ORS versus glucose‐based ORS (osmolarity ≤ 270) Eight trials (752 participants) evaluated this comparison, and seven trials used rice as a polymer source. Polymer‐based ORS may decrease mean stool output in the first 24 hours by 24 mL/kg (mean difference (MD) −24.60 mL/kg, 95% CI −40.69 to −8.51; one trial, 99 participants,  low quality evidence ). The average duration of diarrhoea may be reduced by eight hours (MD −8.24 hours, 95% CI −13.17 to −3.30; I² statistic = 86%, five trials, 364 participants,  low quality evidence ) with polymer ORS but results are heterogeneous. Limited trials showed no observed difference in the risk of unscheduled use of intravenous fluid (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.02; I² statistic = 30%; four trials, 376 participants,  very low quality evidence ), vomiting ( very low quality evidence ), and hyponatraemia ( very low quality evidence ). Polymer‐based ORS versus glucose‐based ORS (osmolarity ≥ 310) Twenty‐seven trials (3532 participants) evaluated this comparison using a variety of polymers. On average, polymer ORS may reduce the total stool output in the first 24 hours by around 65 mL/kg (MD −65.47 mL/kg, 95% CI −83.92 to −47.03; 16 trials, 1483 participants,  low quality evidence ), and may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by around eight hours (MD −8.57 hours; SD −13.17 to −4.03; 16 trials, 1137 participants,  low quality evidence ) with substantial heterogeneity. The proportion of participants that required intravenous hydration was low in most trials with fewer in the polymer ORS group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98; 19 trials, 1877 participant,  low quality evidence ) . Subgroup analysis by type of pathogen suggested an effect on unscheduled intravenous fluid in those infected with mixed pathogens (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96; 11 trials, 928 participants,  low quality evidence ), but not in participants positive for  Vibrio cholerae  (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 7 trials, 535 participants,  low quality evidence ). No difference was observed in the number of patients who developed vomiting (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.14; 10 trials, 584 participants,  very low quality evidence ), hyponatraemia (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.44; 4 trials, 385 participants,  very low quality evidence ), hypokalaemia (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.25; 2 trials, 260 participants,  low quality evidence ), or persistent diarrhoea (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.41; 2 trials, 885 participants,  very low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Polymer‐based ORS shows advantages compared to glucose‐based ORS (at ≥ 310 mOsm/L). Comparisons favoured polymer‐based ORS over ORS ≤ 270 but analysis was underpowered. 15 April 2019 No update planned Other This is not a current research question","Food‐based oral rehydration solution for acute diarrhoea What is polymer‐based ORS and how might it help Acute diarrhoea is a common cause of death and illness in developing countries. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) have had a massive impact worldwide in reducing the number of deaths related to diarrhoea. The original ORS was based on glucose and had an osmolarity of ≥ 310 mOsm/L (ORS ≥ 310). Glucose‐based ORS with a lower osmolarity was later introduced in attempts to improve efficacy, and is considered better at reducing the amount and duration of diarrhoea. Most ORS is in the form of a sugar–salt solution, but over the years people have tried adding a variety of compounds ('glucose polymers') such as whole rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize. The aim is to slowly release glucose into the gut and improve the absorption of the water and salt in the solution. This review updates a Cochrane Review published in 2009, and assesses the available evidence on the use of polymer‐based ORS (both rice and non‐rice based) versus glucose‐based ORS. What the research says Cochrane researchers examined the available evidence up to 5 September 2016. Thirty‐five trials including 4284 participants met the inclusion criteria: 28 trials included children; five included adults; and two included both. Most trials compared polymer‐based ORS with a sugar–salt ORS with a particular strength (ORS ≥ 310), which is slightly more salty than the currently agreed best formula (≤ 270 mOsm/L). The trials' methodological quality varied. In people given polymer‐based ORS versus sugar‐salt ORS ≤ 270 mOsm/L there was insufficient evidence to show that one is better than the other ( low  to very low quality of evidence ). In those given polymer‐based ORS versus sugar‐salt ORS ≥ 310 mOsm/L, there was a lower amount of stool and shorter time of diarrhoea in the polymer‐based ORS group. No difference was observed between the two groups regarding the number of people who needed a drip to be rehydrated. Adverse events were similar ( low  to very low quality of evidence).",CD006519
"Background Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children younger than five years of age. Most deaths occur during infancy and in low‐income countries. Daily zinc supplements have been reported to prevent acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and reduce child mortality. This is an update of a review first published in 2010. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (Issue 21 October 2016), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2016), Embase (1974 to October 2016), LILACS (1982 to October 2016), CINAHL (1981 to October 2016), Web of Science (1985 to October 2016) and IMSEAR (1980 to October 2016). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating zinc supplementation for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged from 2 months to 59 months. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We did not identify any new studies for inclusion in this update. We included six studies that involved 5193 participants. Analysis showed that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 13% (fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.94, six studies, low‐quality evidence) and prevalence of pneumonia by 41% (random‐effects RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, one study, n = 609, low‐quality evidence). On subgroup analysis, we found that zinc reduced the incidence of pneumonia defined by specific clinical criteria by 21% (i.e. confirmation by chest examination or chest radiograph) (fixed‐effect RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, four studies, n = 3261), but had no effect on lower specificity pneumonia case definition (i.e. age‐specific fast breathing with or without lower chest indrawing) (fixed‐effect RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, four studies, n = 1932). Authors' conclusions Zinc supplementation in children is associated with a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia.","Zinc supplementation for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months Review question We evaluated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation to prevent pneumonia in children aged from two to 59 months. Background Zinc is an essential element for children's growth and development. Too little zinc is associated with increased risk of infection, particularly diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children are more prone to zinc deficiency because they are less able to absorb dietary zinc and some children, especially in low‐income countries, may not have received enough zinc from their mothers before birth. Zinc supplements for children has been reported to prevent pneumonia. Search date We searched the literature up to October 2016. This is an update of a review published in 2010. We did not find any new studies for this update. Study characteristics We included six studies that investigated zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Peru and South Africa and involved 5193 children aged from two to 59 months. Children received either zinc or a similar‐looking treatment that did not contain zinc. In two studies, children were also given vitamin A. Study funding sources All included studies were funded. Of these, three explicitly mentioned that funding agencies had no role in the design and results of the study. Key results Zinc supplementation was significantly associated with reducing the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia among children aged from two to 59 months. On subgroup analysis, we found that a more stringent diagnosis (radiological examination) increased the reduction in pneumonia incidence. Quality of the evidence Overall, evidence quality was assessed as low on GRADE assessment.",CD005978
"Background Older people with hip fractures are often malnourished at the time of fracture, and subsequently have poor food intake. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2010. Objectives To review the effects (benefits and harms) of nutritional interventions in older people recovering from hip fracture. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Embase, CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, trial registers and reference lists. The search was last run in November 2015. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of nutritional interventions for people aged over 65 years with hip fracture where the interventions were started within the first month after hip fracture. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we pooled data for primary outcomes which were: all cause mortality; morbidity; postoperative complications (e.g. wound infections, pressure sores, deep venous thromboses, respiratory and urinary infections, cardiovascular events); and 'unfavourable outcome' defined as the number of trial participants who died plus the number of survivors with complications. We also pooled data for adverse events such as diarrhoea. Main results We included 41 trials involving 3881 participants. Outcome data were limited and risk of bias assessment showed that trials were often methodologically flawed, with less than half of trials at low risk of bias for allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, or selective reporting of outcomes. The available evidence was judged of either low or very low quality indicating that we were uncertain or very uncertain about the estimates. Eighteen trials evaluated oral multinutrient feeds that provided non‐protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. There was low‐quality evidence that oral feeds had little effect on mortality (24/486 versus 31/481; risk ratio (RR) 0.81 favouring supplementation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.32; 15 trials). Thirteen trials evaluated the effect of oral multinutrient feeds on complications (e.g. pressure sore, infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, confusion). There was low‐quality evidence that the number of participants with complications may be reduced with oral multinutrient feeds (123/370 versus 157/367; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86; 11 trials). Based on very low‐quality evidence from six studies (334 participants), oral supplements may result in lower numbers with 'unfavourable outcome' (death or complications): RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89. There was very low‐quality evidence for six studies (442 participants) that oral supplementation did not result in an increased incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.05). Only very low‐quality evidence was available from the four trials examining nasogastric multinutrient feeding. Pooled data from three heterogeneous trials showed no evidence of an effect of supplementation on mortality (14/142 versus 14/138; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.97). One trial (18 participants) found no difference in complications. None reported on unfavourable outcome. Nasogastric feeding was poorly tolerated. One study reported no cases of aspiration pneumonia. There is very low‐quality evidence from one trial (57 participants, mainly men) of no evidence for an effect of tube feeding followed by oral supplementation on mortality or complications. Tube feeding, however, was poorly tolerated. There is very low‐quality evidence from one trial (80 participants) that a combination of intravenous feeding and oral supplements may not affect mortality but could reduce complications. However, this expensive intervention is usually reserved for people with non‐functioning gastrointestinal tracts, which is unlikely in this trial. Four trials tested increasing protein intake in an oral feed. These provided low‐quality evidence for no clear effect of increased protein intake on mortality (30/181 versus 21/180; RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.37; 4 trials) or number of participants with complications but very low‐quality and contradictory evidence of a reduction in unfavourable outcomes (66/113 versus 82/110; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95; 2 trials). There was no evidence of an effect on adverse events such as diarrhoea. Trials testing intravenous vitamin B1 and other water soluble vitamins, oral 1‐alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D), high dose bolus vitamin D, different oral doses or sources of vitamin D, intravenous or oral iron, ornithine alpha‐ketoglutarate versus an isonitrogenous peptide supplement, taurine versus placebo, and a supplement with vitamins, minerals and amino acids, provided low‐ or very low‐quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications, where reported. Based on low‐quality evidence, one trial evaluating the use of dietetic assistants to help with feeding indicated that this intervention may reduce mortality (19/145 versus 36/157; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95) but not the number of participants with complications (79/130 versus 84/125). Authors' conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that oral multinutrient supplements started before or soon after surgery may prevent complications within the first 12 months after hip fracture, but that they have no clear effect on mortality. There is very low‐quality evidence that oral supplements may reduce 'unfavourable outcome' (death or complications) and that they do not result in an increased incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea. Adequately sized randomised trials with robust methodology are required. In particular, the role of dietetic assistants, and peripheral venous feeding or nasogastric feeding in very malnourished people require further evaluation.","Nutritional supplementation for older people after hip fracture Background and aim Older people with hip fractures are often malnourished at the time of their fracture and many have poor food intake while in hospital. Malnutrition may hinder recovery after hip fracture. We reviewed the effects of nutritional interventions in older people recovering from hip fracture. Search results We searched the scientific literature up to November 2015 and include 41 studies including 3881 participants. All nutritional interventions were started within one month of hip fracture. The studies had flaws in their methods that may affect the validity of their results. Some evidence was very low quality which means we are very unsure of the results. Key results Eighteen studies examined the use of additional oral feeds that provided energy from sources other than protein, protein, some vitamins and minerals. There was low‐quality evidence that these multinutrient oral feeds may not reduce mortality but that they may reduce the number of people with complications (e.g. pressure sore, infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, confusion). There was very low‐quality evidence that oral multinutrient feeds may reduce unfavourable outcome (death or complications) and that they did not result in increased vomiting and diarrhoea. Four studies examined nasogastric tube feeding, where liquid food is delivered via a tube inserted into the nose and passed down into the stomach, with non‐protein energy, protein, some vitamins and minerals. These studies provided very low‐quality evidence that tube feeding, which was poorly tolerated, did not seem to make a difference to mortality or complications. Unfavourable outcome was not recorded and there was insufficient evidence on adverse events. One study provided very low‐quality evidence that nasogastric tube feeding followed by oral feeds may not affect mortality or complications. It reported that tube feeding was poorly tolerated. One study provided very low‐quality evidence that giving feed into a vein initially and then by mouth may not affect mortality but may reduce complications. However, we were surprised that this intervention was being used in people who seemed to be able to take nutrition orally. Increasing protein intake in an oral feed was tested in four studies. These provided low‐quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications and very low‐quality evidence for a reduction in unfavourable outcome. Studies testing intravenous vitamin B1 and other water soluble vitamins, oral 1‐alpha‐hydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D), high dose bolus vitamin D, different oral doses or sources of vitamin D, intravenous or oral iron, ornithine alpha‐ketoglutarate versus an isonitrogenous peptide supplement, taurine versus placebo, and a supplement with vitamins, minerals and amino acids, provided low‐ or very low‐quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications, where reported. One study, evaluating the use of dietetic assistants to help with feeding, provided low‐quality evidence that this may reduce mortality but not the numbers of people with complications. Conclusions Oral supplements with non‐protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals started before or soon after surgery may prevent complications after hip fracture in older people but may not affect mortality. Adequately sized randomised studies with better design are required. We suggest that the role of dietetic assistants, and of peripheral venous feeding or nasogastric feeding in very malnourished patients, require further evaluation.",CD001880
"Background Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are frequently managed in primary care settings. Although many are viral, and there is an increasing problem with antibiotic resistance, antibiotics continue to be prescribed for URTIs. Written patient information may be a simple way to reduce antibiotic use for acute URTIs. Objectives To assess if written information for patients (or parents of child patients) reduces the use of antibiotics for acute URTIs in primary care. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials registry up to July 2016 without language or publication restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients (or parents of child patients) with acute URTIs, that compared written patient information delivered immediately before or during prescribing, with no information. RCTs needed to have measured our primary outcome (antibiotic use) to be included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. We could not meta‐analyse included studies due to significant methodological and statistical heterogeneity; we summarised the data narratively. Main results Two RCTs met our inclusion criteria, involving a total of 827 participants. Both studies only recruited children with acute URTIs (adults were not involved in either study): 558 children from 61 general practices in England and Wales; and 269 primary care doctors who provided data on 33,792 patient‐doctor consultations in Kentucky, USA. The UK study had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding and the US cluster‐randomised study had a high risk of bias because the methods to allocate participants to treatment groups was not clear, and there was evidence of baseline imbalance. In both studies, clinicians provided written information to parents of child patients during primary care consultations: one trained general practitioners (GPs) to discuss an eight‐page booklet with parents; the other conducted a factorial trial with two comparison groups (written information compared to usual care and written information plus prescribing feedback to clinicians compared to prescribing feedback alone). Doctors in the written information arms received 25 copies of two‐page government‐sponsored pamphlets to distribute to parents. Compared to usual care, we found moderate quality evidence (one study) that written information significantly reduced the number of antibiotics used by patients (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.80; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 20% (22% versus 42%)) and had no significant effect on reconsultation rates (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.32), or parent satisfaction with consultation (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). Low quality evidence (two studies) demonstrated that written information also reduced antibiotics prescribed by clinicians (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.78; ARR 21% (20% versus 41%); and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.86; 9% ARR (45% versus 54%)). Neither study measured resolution of symptoms, patient knowledge about antibiotics for acute URTIs, or complications for this comparison. Compared to prescribing feedback, we found low quality evidence that written information plus prescribing feedback significantly increased the number of antibiotics prescribed by clinicians (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.17; absolute risk increase 6% (50% versus 44%)). Neither study measured reconsultation rate, resolution of symptoms, patient knowledge about antibiotics for acute URTIs, patient satisfaction with consultation or complications for this comparison. Authors' conclusions Compared to usual care, moderate quality evidence from one study showed that trained GPs providing written information to parents of children with acute URTIs in primary care can reduce the number of antibiotics used by patients without any negative impact on reconsultation rates or parental satisfaction with consultation. Low quality evidence from two studies shows that, compared to usual care, GPs prescribe fewer antibiotics for acute URTIs but prescribe more antibiotics when written information is provided alongside prescribing feedback (compared to prescribing feedback alone). There was no evidence addressing resolution of patients' symptoms, patient knowledge about antibiotics for acute URTIs, or frequency of complications. To fill evidence gaps, future studies should consider testing written information on antibiotic use for adults with acute URTIs in high‐ and low‐income settings provided without clinician training and presented in different formats (such as electronic). Future study designs should endeavour to ensure blinded outcome assessors. Study aims should include measurement of the effect of written information on the number of antibiotics used by patients and prescribed by clinicians, patient satisfaction, reconsultation, patients' knowledge about antibiotics, resolution of symptoms, and complications.","Does written information reduce antibiotic use for upper airway infections among people treated in primary care settings? Review question We wanted to find out if written information reduces antibiotic use for acute upper airway infections (colds, sore throats, cough, or earaches). Background Most colds, sore throats, coughs and earaches are caused by viruses. Although antibiotics do not work against viruses, they are sometimes prescribed. We wanted to find out if giving written information about antibiotics immediately before or during doctor visits, together with usual care, changed antibiotic use compared with the doctor's usual practice or something else. We also wanted to know if: patients would be more likely to return to their doctor; symptoms would improve sooner; patients' knowledge about antibiotics would improve; patients were satisfied with their doctor's care; and if complications occurred. Search date We searched the literature up to July 2016. Study characteristics We found two studies that included children with upper airway infections: one involved 558 children who were recruited from 61 general practices in England and Wales; and another of 269 doctors who provided data on 33,792 patient‐doctor consultations in Kentucky, USA. Participants were children accompanied by an adult. One study trained general practitioners (GPs) to discuss written information with parents, and in the other, doctors distributed copies of government‐sponsored pamphlets to parents. Study funding sources Both studies were funded by government bodies and one was also funded by Pfizer (a pharmaceutical company). Key results Providing a booklet and explanation by a specially‐trained doctor reduced the number of antibiotics children consumed by 20% (from 42% to 22%) without affecting parent satisfaction with consultation or numbers of return visits for the same illness. Compared to the doctor’s usual practice, two studies showed that providing a booklet reduced the proportion of children prescribed an antibiotic by 9% to 21%. When doctors were also given feedback on their antibiotic prescribing along with providing a booklet to parents, the proportion of children prescribed an antibiotic increased by 6% (from 44% to 50%). None of the included studies assessed if people were better informed, how long symptoms lasted, or if people had complications. Quality of evidence Evidence quality was moderate to low. Doctors and parents knew when written information had been used. One study had a high risk of bias because study groups were not comparable at baseline, so we can be less confident of its findings. Studies were set in the UK and USA, so results are not applicable to lower‐income countries, nor for different primary healthcare services, including settings where prescriptions are unnecessary to obtain antibiotics.",CD011360
"Background Cancer‐related fatigue is reported as the most common and distressing symptom experienced by patients with cancer. It can exacerbate the experience of other symptoms, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Educational interventions may help people to manage this fatigue or to cope with this symptom, and reduce its overall burden. Despite the importance of education for managing cancer‐related fatigue there are currently no systematic reviews examining this approach. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions for managing cancer‐related fatigue in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, OTseeker and PEDro up to 1st November 2016. We also searched trials registries. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of educational interventions focused on cancer‐related fatigue where fatigue was a primary outcome. Studies must have aimed to evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed specifically to manage cancer‐related fatigue, or to evaluate educational interventions targeting a constellation of physical symptoms or quality of life where fatigue was the primary focus. The studies could have compared educational interventions with no intervention or wait list controls, usual care or attention controls, or an alternative intervention for cancer‐related fatigue in adults with any type of cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. A third independent person checked the data extraction. The main outcome considered in this review was cancer‐related fatigue. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of Findings' table. Main results We included 14 RCTs with 2213 participants across different cancer diagnoses. Four studies used only 'information‐giving' educational strategies, whereas the remainder used mainly information‐giving strategies coupled with some problem‐solving, reinforcement, or support techniques. Interventions differed in delivery including: mode of delivery (face to face, web‐based, audiotape, telephone); group or individual interventions; number of sessions provided (ranging from 2 to 12 sessions); and timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment (during or after completion). Most trials compared educational interventions to usual care and meta‐analyses compared educational interventions to usual care or attention controls. Methodological issues that increased the risk of bias were evident including lack of blinding of outcome assessors, unclear allocation concealment in over half of the studies, and generally small sample sizes. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate, downgraded mainly due to high risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision. There was moderate quality evidence of a small reduction in fatigue intensity from a meta‐analyses of eight studies (1524 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.52 to ‐0.04) comparing educational interventions with usual care or attention control. We found low quality evidence from twelve studies (1711 participants) that educational interventions had a small effect on general/overall fatigue (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.04) compared to usual care or attention control. There was low quality evidence from three studies (622 participants) of a moderate size effect of educational interventions for reducing fatigue distress (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐1.09 to ‐0.05) compared to usual care, and this could be considered clinically significant. Pooled data from four studies (439 participants) found a small reduction in fatigue interference with daily life (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.16; moderate quality evidence). No clear effects on fatigue were found related to type of cancer treatment or timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment, and there were insufficient data available to determine the effect of educational interventions on fatigue by stage of disease, tumour type or group versus individual intervention. Three studies (571 participants) provided low quality evidence for a reduction in anxiety in favour of the intervention group (mean difference (MD) ‐1.47, 95% CI ‐2.76 to ‐0.18) which, for some, would be considered clinically significant. Two additional studies not included in the meta‐analysis also reported statistically significant improvements in anxiety in favour of the educational intervention, whereas a third study did not. Compared with usual care or attention control, educational interventions showed no significant reduction in depressive symptoms (four studies, 881 participants, SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.23; very low quality evidence). Three additional trials not included in the meta‐analysis found no between‐group differences in the symptoms of depression. No between‐group difference was evident in the capacity for activities of daily living or physical function when comparing educational interventions with usual care (4 studies, 773 participants, SMD 0.33, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.75) and the quality of evidence was low. Pooled evidence of low quality from two of three studies examining the effect of educational interventions compared to usual care found an improvement in global quality of life on a 0‐100 scale (MD 11.47, 95% CI 1.29 to 21.65), which would be considered clinically significant for some. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. Authors' conclusions Educational interventions may have a small effect on reducing fatigue intensity, fatigue's interference with daily life, and general fatigue, and could have a moderate effect on reducing fatigue distress. Educational interventions focused on fatigue may also help reduce anxiety and improve global quality of life, but it is unclear what effect they might have on capacity for activities of daily living or depressive symptoms. Additional studies undertaken in the future are likely to impact on our confidence in the conclusions. The incorporation of education for the management of fatigue as part of routine care appears reasonable. However, given the complex nature of this symptom, educational interventions on their own are unlikely to optimally reduce fatigue or help people manage its impact, and should be considered in conjunction with other interventions. Just how educational interventions are best delivered, and their content and timing to maximise outcomes, are issues that require further research.","Education for the management of cancer‐related fatigue Objectives This systematic review sought to find out how well educational interventions worked for managing cancer‐related fatigue. Condition Fatigue is a common and problematic symptom for people with cancer that is greater than the tiredness experienced in everyday life. It can make the experience of other symptoms worse, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Interventions Education can provide people with information about what fatigue is and how to manage it. For example, managing fatigue may involve conserving energy throughout the day, and learning about the benefits of exercise, diet, relaxation, and good sleep routines. These approaches may help people to manage their fatigue and help them cope with its effects. In November 2016 we found 14 trials using education for cancer‐related fatigue compared to the usual care people received or to an attention control such as providing general information about cancer. All of the included studies were randomised controlled trials. These trials were undertaken with adults with any type or stage of cancer. Results The review found that education may have a small effect on reducing the intensity of fatigue, its interference in daily activities or relationships, and general (overall) fatigue. It could have a moderate effect on reducing distress from fatigue amongst people with non‐advanced cancer. There may also be beneficial effects on anxiety and overall quality of life, although it is unclear whether it reduces depression. It is unknown if this result might differ between types of cancer treatment or if the education is provided during or after cancer treatment. Not enough is known about the type of education that is most effective, when it is best provided, or whether it is effective for people with advanced cancer. Quality of evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. There were problems with the design of some studies, and some were very small in size. The quality of the evidence therefore varied from very low to moderate overall and the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution.",CD008144
"Background In patients of various ages undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV), it has been observed that positions other than the standard supine position, such as the prone position, may improve respiratory parameters. The benefits of these positions have not been clearly defined for critically ill newborns receiving MV. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2013. Objectives Primary objective To assess the effects of different positioning of newborn infants receiving MV (supine vs prone, lateral decubitus or quarter turn from prone) in improving short‐term respiratory outcomes. Secondary objective To assess the effects of different positioning of newborn infants receiving MV on mortality and neuromotor and developmental outcomes over the long term, and on other complications of prematurity. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 22 August 2016), Embase (1980 to 22 August 2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 22 August 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised clinical trials comparing different positions in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation. Data collection and analysis Three unblinded review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review and extracted study data. We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. If the meta‐analysis was not appropriate owing to substantial clinical heterogeneity between trials, we presented review findings in narrative format. Main results We included in this review 19 trials involving 516 participants. Seven of the included studies (N = 222) had not been evaluated in the previous review. Investigators compared several positions: prone versus supine, prone alternant versus supine, prone versus lateral right, lateral right versus supine, lateral left versus supine, lateral alternant versus supine, lateral right versus lateral left, quarter turn from prone versus supine, quarter turn from prone versus prone and good lung dependent versus good lung uppermost. Apart from two studies that compared lateral alternant versus supine, one comparing lateral right versus supine and two comparing prone or prone alternant versus the supine position, all included studies had a cross‐over design. In five studies, infants were ventilated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); in the other studies, infants were treated with conventional ventilation (CV). Risks of bias did not differ substantially for different comparisons and outcomes. This update detects a moderate to high grade of inconsistency, similar to previous versions. However, for the analysed outcomes, the direction of effect was the same in all studies. Therefore, we consider that this inconsistency had little effect on the conclusions of the meta‐analysis. When comparing prone versus supine position, we observed an increase in arterial oxygen tension (PO 2 ) in the prone position (mean difference (MD) 5.49 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.92 to 8.05 mmHg; three trials; 116 participants; I 2 = 0). When percent haemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured with pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ), improvement in the prone position was between 1.13% and 3.24% (typical effect based on nine trials with 154 participants; I 2 = 89%). The subgroup ventilated with CPAP (three trials; 59 participants) showed a trend towards improving SpO2 in the prone position compared with the supine position, although the mean difference (1.91%) was not significant (95% CI ‐1.14 to 4.97) and heterogeneity was extreme (I 2 = 95%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with low risk of selection bias showed homogeneous results and verified a small but significant effect (MD 0.64, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.02; four trials; 92 participants; I 2 = 0). We also noted a slight improvement in the number of episodes of desaturation; it was not possible to establish whether this effect continued once the intervention was stopped. Investigators studied few adverse effects from the interventions in sufficient detail. Two studies analysed tracheal cultures of neonates after five days on MV, reporting lower bacterial colonisation in the alternating lateral position than in the supine posture. Other effects ‐ positive or negative ‐ cannot be excluded in light of the relatively small numbers of neonates studied. Authors' conclusions This update of our last review in 2013 supports previous conclusions. Evidence of low to moderate quality favours the prone position for slightly improved oxygenation in neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, we found no evidence to suggest that particular body positions during mechanical ventilation of the neonate are effective in producing sustained and clinically relevant improvement.","Best position for newborns who need assisted ventilation Review question:  For newborn infants who need assisted ventilation, can changing the infant's body position improve breathing or other clinical outcomes including survival? Background:  Newborns admitted to an intensive care unit often need help breathing (mechanical ventilation). This support is generally provided by a device placed inside the newborn's nose or mouth (which sometimes reaches the trachea), through which different pressures and concentrations of oxygen are sent.    The usual practice is to position the newborn in supine (face‐up) position during ventilation. However, it is not certain whether other positions, for example, “face‐down” (prone position), could be more advantageous for breathing or other pursuits, including survival. This is an update of previously published reviews. Search date:  The evidence is up to date as of August 2016. Study characteristics:  We included in this review 19 trials involving 516 participants. Comparisons included supine position versus prone and different lateral positions (right, left, alternant or quarter for prone). The outcome most often reported in these studies was change in oxygenation. Key results:  We found no clear evidence that particular body positions in newborn babies who need assisted ventilation are effective in producing relevant and sustained improvement. However, putting infants who receive assisted ventilation in the face‐down (prone) position for a short time slightly improves levels of oxygen in the blood (evidence of moderate quality), and these infants undergo fewer episodes of poor oxygenation (evidence of low quality). Researchers described no adverse effects for any of the positions compared, although studies did not last long enough for investigators to detect all possible effects. What's more, most of the babies participating in the studies were placed in alternate positions. For this reason, medium‐ or long‐term adverse effects cannot be attributed to a given position. Quality of the evidence:  Confidence in review conclusions depends on the characteristics of included studies such as risk of bias (design limitations), consistency (heterogeneity across studies), precision (small confidence interval) and directness (same effect), and requires that all included studies were published independently of their outcomes. The quality of evidence for these outcomes allows us to have very low to moderate confidence in our conclusions.",CD003668
"Background Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that breastfeeding newborn infants during painful procedures reduces pain. Mechanisms are considered to be multifactorial and include sucking, skin‐to‐skin contact, warmth, rocking, sound and smell of the mother, and possibly endogenous opiates present in the breast milk. Objectives To determine the effect of breastfeeding on procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) up to one year of age compared to no intervention, placebo, parental holding, skin‐to‐skin contact, expressed breast milk, formula milk, bottle feeding, sweet‐tasting solutions (e.g. sucrose or glucose), distraction, or other interventions. Search methods We searched the following databases to 18 February 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs involving infants aged 28 days postnatal to 12 months and receiving breastfeeding while undergoing a painful procedure. Comparators included, but were not limited to, oral administration of water, sweet‐tasting solutions, expressed breast or formula milk, no intervention, use of pacifiers, positioning, cuddling, distraction, topical anaesthetics, and skin‐to‐skin care. Procedures included, but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, venipuncture, intravenous line insertion, heel lance, and finger lance. We applied no language restrictions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. The main outcome measures were behavioural or physiological indicators and composite pain scores, as well as other clinically important outcomes reported by the authors of included studies. We pooled data for the most comparable outcomes and where data from at least two studies could be included. We used mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), employing a random‐effects model for continuous outcomes measured on the same scales. For continuous outcomes measured on different scales, we pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) and associated 95% CIs. For dichotomous outcomes, we planned to pool events between groups across studies using risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. However, as insufficient studies reported dichotomous outcomes, we did not pool such events. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies were conducted during early childhood immunisation. As the breastfeeding intervention cannot be blinded, we rated all studies as being at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. We assessed nine studies as being at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. In addition, we rated nine studies as high risk for blinding of outcome assessment. We scored risk of bias related to random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting as unclear for the majority of the studies due to lack of information. Our primary outcome was pain. Breastfeeding reduced behavioural pain responses (cry time and pain scores) during vaccination compared to no treatment, oral water, and other interventions such as cuddling, oral glucose, topical anaesthetic, massage, and vapocoolant. Breastfeeding did not consistently reduce changes in physiological indicators, such as heart rate. We pooled data for duration of cry from six studies (n = 547 infants). Breastfeeding compared to water or no treatment resulted in a 38‐second reduction in cry time (MD ‐38, 95% CI ‐50 to ‐26; P < 0.00001). The quality of the evidence according to GRADE for this outcome was moderate, as most infants were 6 months or younger, and outcomes may be different for infants during their 12‐month immunisation. We pooled data for pain scores from five studies (n = 310 infants). Breastfeeding was associated with a 1.7‐point reduction in standardised pain scores (SMD ‐1.7, 95% CI ‐2.2 to ‐1.3); we considered this evidence to be of moderate quality as data were primarily from infants younger than 6 months of age. We could pool heart rate data following injections for only two studies (n = 186); we considered this evidence to be of low quality due to insufficient data. There were no differences between breastfeeding and control (MD ‐3.6, ‐23 to 16). Four of the 10 studies had more than two study arms. Breastfeeding was more effective in reducing crying duration or pain scores during vaccination compared to: 25% dextrose and topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA), vapocoolant, maternal cuddling, and massage. No included studies reported adverse events. Authors' conclusions We conclude, based on the 10 studies included in this review, that breastfeeding may help reduce pain during vaccination for infants beyond the neonatal period. Breastfeeding consistently reduced behavioural responses of cry duration and composite pain scores during and following vaccinations. However, there was no evidence that breastfeeding had an effect on physiological responses. No studies included in this review involved populations of hospitalised infants undergoing other skin‐breaking procedures. Although it may be possible to extrapolate the review results to this population, further studies of efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability in this population are warranted.","Does breastfeeding reduce vaccination pain in babies aged 1 to 12 months? Bottom line We found that breastfeeding before and during vaccination injections helped to reduce pain in most babies up to the age of one year. Background Needles are used for babies' early childhood vaccinations and medical care during childhood illnesses. These are essential, but painful. They cause distress for the babies and often their parents/caregivers, and can result in future anxiety and fear about needles. Breastfeeding during blood tests in newborn babies reduces pain. Breastfeeding when possible and feasible may also help to comfort babies and reduce their pain beyond the newborn period and throughout infancy. Study characteristics In February 2016 we searched the medical literature for studies examining the effectiveness of breastfeeding babies 1 to 12 months old during the use of needles. We compared effectiveness of breastfeeding in reducing pain (as scored by crying time and pain scores), to holding, babies lying flat, or the giving of water or sweet solutions. We found 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies examined if breastfeeding reduced pain during vaccinations. Key results Breastfeeding reduced crying in young babies having vaccinations. On average, breastfed babies cried for 38 seconds less than babies who were not breastfed (6 studies; 547 infants; moderate‐quality evidence), and pain scores were significantly lower (5 studies; 310 infants; moderate‐quality evidence). No studies reported on any harm (very low‐quality evidence). We could draw no conclusions on risk of harm while breastfeeding healthy babies during vaccination. Going forward: if mothers are breastfeeding, it could be considered when possible for babies during vaccinations. More evidence is needed to learn if breastfeeding helps older babies and babies in hospital during blood work or procedures such as insertion of drips. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was moderate for crying time and pain scores. Most studies included younger infants aged 1 to 6 months. Further research including older infants up to 12 months of age may change our conclusions. In addition, the studies evaluated the effects of breastfeeding during vaccination. We do not know whether breastfeeding helps sick babies aged 1 to 12 months in hospital during blood sampling or drip insertion.",CD011248
"Background Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic disease. It is important to determine if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) given as supplements or added to infant formula prevent the development of allergy. Objectives To determine the effect of higher PUFA intake during infancy to prevent allergic disease. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 14 September 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 14 September 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a PUFA with no PUFA in infants for the prevention of allergy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. We used fixed‐effect analyses. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. Main results The search found 17 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs on allergic outcomes in infants. Only nine studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes that could be used in meta‐analyses. Of these, there were methodological concerns for eight. In infants up to two years of age, meta‐analyses found no difference in incidence of all allergy (1 study, 323 infants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.09; heterogeneity not applicable), asthma (3 studies, 1162 infants; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.35, I 2  = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.05, I 2  = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (7 studies, 1906 infants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06, I 2  = 0%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I 2  = 0%) or food allergy (3 studies, 915 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19, I 2  = 63%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I 2  = 74%). There was a reduction in allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 594 infants; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96, I 2  = 6%; RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.08 to ‐0.00, I 2  = 54%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 13 to ∞). In children aged two to five years, meta‐analysis found no difference in incidence of all allergic disease (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.02, I 2  = 43%; RD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.31 to ‐0.00, I 2  = 63%; NNTB 6, 95% CI 3 to ∞), asthma (1 study, 89 infants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.02; RD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.02; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 50), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.24, I 2  = 0%; RD ‐0.09 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.04, I 2  = 24%) or food allergy (1 study, 65 infants; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.25 to 20.68; RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.16; heterogeneity not applicable). In children aged two to five years, meta‐analysis found no difference in prevalence of all allergic disease (2 studies, 633 infants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19, I 2  = 36%; RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.08 to 0.07, I 2  = 0%), asthma (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.53, I 2  = 0%; RD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.09, I 2  = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, I 2  = 0%; RD ‐0.04 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.02, I 2  = 0%), allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25, I 2  = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.08, I 2  = 0%) or food allergy (1 study, 119 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.19; RD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.20 to ‐0.00; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to ∞). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that PUFA supplementation in infancy has an effect on infant or childhood allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema or food allergy. However, the quality of evidence was very low. There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis.","Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infancy for the prevention of allergy Review question In infants, does supplementation of the diet with oil high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) result in a decreased risk of developing allergies such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever (called allergic rhinitis) and food allergy in infancy and childhood? Background Allergy is responsible for a substantial health burden in infants, children and adults. Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic disease. Dietary PUFAs, such as fish oil, have a role in inflammatory conditions. It is important to determine if dietary PUFAs given as supplements or added to infant formula have the potential to prevent the development of allergy. PUFAs may be given to the breastfeeding mother, to the infant as a supplement (contents of a capsule) or added to infant formula. Study characteristics This review found 100 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs in infants through searches of medical databases up to September 2015. However, only nine of these studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes (measures). Of these nine studies, we considered only one to be high quality. Five studies reported all allergy as an outcome measure; four studies reported asthma; all nine studies reported dermatitis/eczema; two studies reported allergic rhinitis and four studies reported food allergy. Key results PUFA supplementation in infancy did not affect the risk of infant (aged up to two years of age) or childhood (aged up to 10 years of age) allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema and food allergy. There was a reduction in the risk of allergic rhinitis during infancy, however, there was no effect on the risk of childhood allergic rhinitis. There is insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis. Quality of evidence We graded the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all allergy as very low; the reduction in infant incidence of allergic rhinitis as very low; and the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all other allergic outcomes as very low to low. Further high quality studies are needed before we can determine an effect of higher PUFA intake in infants on the risk of allergic disease.",CD010112
"Background Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the medical course of approximately 10% of mechanically‐ventilated patients, with an estimated attributable mortality of 13%. To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance. The selection of initial antibiotic therapy in VAP is important, as inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While guidelines exist for the antibiotic treatment of hospital‐acquired pneumonia (HAP) from the American Thoracic Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, there are many limitations in the quality of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to summarise the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for VAP. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect of different empirical antimicrobial therapies on the survival and clinical cure of adult patients with ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives included reporting the incidence of adverse events, new superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay associated with these therapies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science to December 2015; we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2016. Selection criteria Two review authors independently assessed RCTs comparing empirical antibiotic treatments of VAP in adult patients, where VAP was defined as new‐onset pneumonia that developed more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Physicians and researchers were not required to be blinded for inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted study data. We pooled studies and analysed them in two ways. We examined monotherapy, or a single experimental antimicrobial drug, versus combination therapy, or multiple experimental antimicrobial drugs. We also examined carbapenem therapy versus non‐carbapenem therapy. Main results We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no statistical difference in all‐cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). We downgraded the quality of evidence for all‐cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison. We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low‐quality evidence. For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta‐analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens. Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem‐cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem‐cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem‐cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84). Of importance, this effect was due to a single study. We found no statistical difference in all‐cause mortality between carbapenem and non‐carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non‐carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non‐carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non‐carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non‐carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis). For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low. Authors' conclusions We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug‐resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta‐analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP. Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.","Antibiotic treatment for ventilated patients with pneumonia Background   Ventilators are machines that breathe for patients. The ventilator tube goes into the mouth and through the windpipe. Sometimes there are bacteria on the ventilator tube that infect the patient's lungs, leading to a disease called ventilator‐associated pneumonia. Ventilator‐associated pneumonia can cause significant harmful effects, and can sometimes lead to death. When treating people with ventilator‐associated pneumonia, doctors must decide which antibiotic therapy to prescribe, usually without knowing the particular type of bacterial infection. This decision is important because inappropriate initial treatment may increase risk of harmful effects and longer hospital stays. Search date   We searched for studies to December 2015. Study characteristics   We looked at studies involving adults aged over 18 years who were treated in intensive care units for ventilator‐associated pneumonia and needed antibiotic treatment. We analysed 12 studies with 3571 participants. Key results   All included studies looked at the use of one antibiotic treatment plan versus another, but these varied among studies. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants, and funding for many was provided by pharmaceutical companies and study authors were affiliated with these companies. We used statistical techniques to evaluate our results. For single versus multiple antibiotics, we found no difference in rates of death or cure, or adverse events. For our comparison of combination therapies with optional adjunctives we were only able to analyse clinical cure for one the antibiotics Tigecycline and imipenem‐cilastatin for which imipenem‐cilastatin was found to have higher clinica cure. We also looked at carbapenem (antibiotics used to treat infections caused by multidrug‐resistant bacteria) versus non‐carbapenem treatment; we found no difference in death rate or adverse effects, but we found that carbapenems are associated with an increase in clinical cure. Quality of evidence We assessed evidence quality as moderate for most outcomes, and very low for clinical cure when single‐antibiotic treatment was compared with multiple antibiotic therapy. We also found that evidence quality was low for adverse events when carbapenem was compared with non‐carbapenem treatment. Conclusions   We did not find differences between single and combination therapy, lending support to use of a single‐antibiotic treatment plan for people with ventilator‐associated pneumonia. This may not be applicable to all patients because studies did not identify patients who are at risk of exposure to harmful types of bacteria. We could not evaluate the best single‐antibiotic choice to treat people with ventilator‐associated pneumonia because there were too few studies, but carbapenems may achieve better cure rates than other tested antibiotics.",CD004267
"Background General anaesthesia is usually associated with unconsciousness. 'Awareness' is when patients have postoperative recall of events or experiences during surgery. 'Wakefulness' is when patients become conscious during surgery, but have no postoperative recollection of the period of consciousness. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of two types of anaesthetic interventions in reducing clinically significant awareness: ‐ anaesthetic drug regimens; and  ‐ intraoperative anaesthetic depth monitors. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, ISSUE 4 2016); PubMed from 1950 to April 2016; MEDLINE from 1950 to April 2016; and Embase from 1980 to April 2016. We contacted experts to identify additional studies. We performed a handsearch of the citations in the review. We did not search trial registries. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of either anaesthetic regimens or anaesthetic depth monitors. We excluded volunteer studies, studies of patients prior to skin incision, intensive care unit studies, and studies that only randomized different word presentations for memory tests (not anaesthetic interventions). Anaesthetic drug regimens included studies of induction or maintenance, or both. Anaesthetic depth monitors included the Bispectral Index monitor, M‐Entropy, Narcotrend monitor, cerebral function monitor, cerebral state monitor, patient state index, and lower oesophageal contractility monitor. The use of anaesthetic depth monitors allows the titration of anaesthetic drugs to maintain unconsciousness. Data collection and analysis At least two authors independently scanned abstracts, extracted data from the studies, and evaluated studies for risk of bias. We made attempts to contact all authors for additional clarification. We performed meta‐analysis statistics in packages of the R language. Main results We included 160 studies with 54,109 enrolled participants; 53,713 participants started the studies and 50,034 completed the studies or data analysis (or both). We could not use 115 RCTs in meta‐analytic comparisons because they had zero awareness events. We did not merge 27 of the remaining 45 studies because they had excessive clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We pooled the remaining 18 eligible RCTs in meta‐analysis. There are 10 studies awaiting classification which we will process when we update the review. The meta‐analyses included 18 trials with 36,034 participants. In the analysis of anaesthetic depth monitoring (either Bispectral Index or M‐entropy) versus standard clinical and electronic monitoring, there were nine trials with 34,744 participants. The overall event rate was 0.5%. The effect favoured neither anaesthetic depth monitoring nor standard clinical and electronic monitoring, with little precision in the odds ratio (OR) estimate (OR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.62). In a five‐study subset of Bispectral Index monitoring versus standard clinical and electronic monitoring, with 34,181 participants, 503 participants gave awareness reports to a blinded, expert panel who adjudicated or judged the outcome for each patient after reviewing the questionnaires: no awareness, possible awareness, or definite awareness. Experts judged 351 patient awareness reports to have no awareness, 87 to have possible awareness, and 65 to have definite awareness. The effect size favoured neither Bispectral Index monitoring nor standard clinical and electronic monitoring, with little precision in the OR estimate for the combination of definite and possible awareness (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.65). The effect size favoured Bispectral Index monitoring for definite awareness, but with little precision in the OR estimate (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.75). We performed three smaller meta‐analyses of anaesthetic drugs. There were nine studies with 1290 participants. Wakefulness was reduced by ketamine and etomidate compared to thiopental. Wakefulness was more frequent than awareness. Benzodiazepines reduces awareness compared to thiopental, ketamine, and placebo., Also, higher doses of inhaled anaesthetics versus lower doses reduced the risk of awareness. We graded the quality of the evidence as low or very low in the 'Summary of findings' tables for the five comparisons. Most of the secondary outcomes in this review were not reported in the included RCTs. Authors' conclusions Anaesthetic depth monitors may have similar effects to standard clinical and electrical monitoring on the risk of awareness during surgery. In older studies comparing anaesthetics in a smaller portion of the patient sample, wakefulness occurred more frequently than awareness. Use of etomidate and ketamine lowered the risk of wakefulness compared to thiopental. Benzodiazepines compared to thiopental and ketamine, or higher doses of inhaled anaesthetics versus lower doses, reduced the risk of awareness.","Methods to prevent people waking during surgery and remembering surgical events Key question We reviewed the evidence about the use of devices to adjust the amount of drugs given during anaesthesia to prevent premature waking up. We also reviewed the evidence about the choice of drugs used during anaesthesia to prevent premature waking up. Background Anaesthesia is the use of drugs to render a patient unconscious for painful procedures and surgery. Being anaesthetized is not the same as being asleep. Someone sleeping may be easily awakened. Someone anaesthetized should only be allowed to awake when the surgery or procedure is completed. A very small percentage of patients may wake up during anaesthesia and surgery; this is called wakefulness. Patients usually do not remember being awake after emerging from anaesthesia. However, an even smaller percentage of patients do remember or recall events from surgery afterwards. This memory is called an awareness event. If that memory is distressing, it can impair the individual's quality of life. New devices known as anaesthetic depth monitors are being used to monitor the patient's brainwave response to anaesthetic drugs. Anaesthetic depth monitors have been compared to the usual clinical observations (e.g. fast heart rate, tearing, movement, etc.) during surgery to adjust the amount of drugs given and reduce the risk of wakefulness and awareness. Anaesthetic drugs have many different effects on brain function. Some drugs are used alone as the sole anaesthetic. Other drugs have insufficient effect to be used as a sole anaesthetic, but are used in combination with more powerful drugs. Drugs may have different risks of the patient waking up prematurely. Search date The evidence is current to April 2016. Study characteristics We found 160 randomized controlled trials with 54,109 participants. Eighteen studies with 36,034 participants contributed evidence about devices and drugs to prevent premature waking up during surgery. Nine studies compared anaesthetic depth monitoring versus other methods to adjust drugs. Nine studies compared different drugs. There are 10 studies awaiting classification, which we will process when we update the review. Key results In the largest studies of anaesthetic depth monitors (five studies with 31,181 participants) there were 152 participants with possible or definite awareness (recall of surgery events after surgery). The use of anaesthetic depth monitors to adjust drugs during anaesthesia may have similar effects on the risk of awareness when compared with standard clinical and electrical monitoring. Wakefulness is reduced by ketamine and etomidate compared to thiopental. Benzodiazepines reduces awareness compared to thiopental, ketamine, and placebo. Also higher doses of inhaled anaesthetics versus lower doses reduced the risk of awareness. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was low or very low because the studies the results were not similar across studies, and there were not enough data.",CD007272
"Background Caesarean sections (CS) are the most frequent major surgery in the world. A transient impairment of bowel motility is expected after CS. Although this usually resolves spontaneously within a few days, it can cause considerable discomfort, require symptomatic medication and delay hospital discharge, thus increasing costs. Chewing gum in the immediate postoperative period is a simple intervention that may be effective in enhancing recovery of bowel function in other types of abdominal surgeries. Objectives To assess the effects of chewing gum to reduce the duration of postoperative ileus and to enhance postoperative recovery after a CS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 June 2016), LILACs (20 June 2016),  ClinicalTrials.gov  (20 June 2016), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (20 June 2016) and the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing chewing gum versus usual care, for women in the first 24 hours after a CS. We included studies published in abstract form only. Quasi‐randomised, cross‐over or cluster‐randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias following standard Cochrane methods. We present dichotomous outcome results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcome results as mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We pooled the results of similar studies using a random‐effects model in case of important heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence. Main results We included 17 randomised trials (3149 participants) conducted in nine different countries. Seven studies (1325 women) recruited exclusively women undergoing elective CS and five studies (833 women) only included women having a primary CS. Ten studies (1731 women) used conventional feeding protocols (nil by mouth until the return of intestinal function). The gum‐chewing regimen varied among studies, in relation to its initiation (immediately after CS, up to 12 hours later), duration of each session (from 15 to 60 minutes) and number of sessions per day (three to more than six). All the studies were classified as having a high risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention, women could not be blinded and most of the outcomes were self‐reported. Primary outcomes of this review: for the women that chewed gum, the  time to passage of first flatus  was seven hours shorter than those women in the 'usual care' control group (MD ‐7.09 hours, 95% CI ‐9.27 to ‐4.91 hours; 2399 women; 13 studies; random‐effects Tau² = 14.63, I² = 95%, very low‐quality evidence). This effect was consistent in all subgroup analyses (primary and repeat CS, time spent chewing gum per day, early and conventional feeding protocols, elective and non‐elective CS and time after CS when gum‐chewing was initiated). The rate of  ileus  was on average over 60% lower in the chewing‐gum group compared to the control (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 1139 participants; four studies; I² = 39%, low‐quality evidence).  Tolerance to gum‐chewing  appeared to be high. Three women in one study complained about the chewing gum (but no further information was provided) and none of the studies reported  adverse effects  (eight studies, 925 women, low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes of this review: the  time to passage of faeces  occurred on average nine hours earlier in the intervention group (MD ‐9.22 hours, 95% CI ‐11.49 to ‐6.95 hours; 2016 participants; 11 studies; random‐effects Tau² = 12.53, I² = 93%, very low‐quality evidence). The average  duration of hospital stay  was shorter in the intervention compared to the control group (MD ‐0.36 days, 95% CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.18 days; 1489 participants; seven studies; random‐effects Tau² = 0.04, I² = 92%). The  first intestinal sounds  were heard earlier in the intervention than in the control group (MD ‐4.56 hours, 95% CI ‐6.18 to ‐2.93 hours; 1729 participants; nine studies; random‐effects Tau² = 5.41, I² = 96%). None of the studies assessed  women's satisfaction  in relation to having to chew gum. The  need for analgesia or antiemetic  agents did not differ between the intervention and control groups (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.13; 726 participants; three studies; random‐effects Tau² = 0.79, I² = 69%). Authors' conclusions This review found 17 randomised controlled trials (involving 3149 women). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for time to first passage of flatus and of faeces and for adverse effects/intolerance to gum chewing because of the high risk of bias of the studies (due to lack of blinding and self‐report). For time to first flatus and faeces, we downgraded the quality of the evidence further because of the high heterogeneity in these meta‐analyses and the potential for publication bias based on the visual inspection of the funnel plots. The quality of the evidence for adverse effects/tolerance to gum chewing and for ileus was downgraded because of the small number of events. The quality of the evidence for ileus was further downgraded due to the unclear risk of bias for the assessors evaluating this outcome. The available evidence suggests that gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period after a CS is a well tolerated intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function. However the overall quality of the evidence is very low to low. Further research is necessary to establish the optimal regimen of gum‐chewing (initiation, number and duration of sessions per day) to enhance bowel function recovery and to assess potential adverse effects of and women's satisfaction with this intervention. New studies also need to assess the compliance of the participants to the recommended gum‐chewing instructions. Future large, well designed and conducted studies, with better methodological and reporting quality, will help to inform future updates of this review and enhance the body of evidence for this intervention.","Does chewing gum after a caesarean section lead to quicker recovery of bowel function? What is the issue? Many women deliver by caesarean section (CS) nowadays. The proportion of women who deliver by CS ranges from 15% to over 50%, in some countries. After a CS it is common for the bowel to stop working for several hours or days. Although this usually resolves by itself in a few days, it may be very uncomfortable. The retained gases and stools can cause the mother's belly to become swollen and painful with cramps and she may feel nauseated and vomit so she is not able to eat. She may need additional medications to ease these symptoms and her hospital discharge may be delayed. The use of medications that relieve pain during labour and painkillers following the surgery can also delay bowel function. Although early feeding after a CS can stimulate the gut, it could also lead to vomiting. That is why many obstetricians still withhold food until bowel sounds are detected and there is passage of gas, or flatus. Chewing gum can help the bowels to function again earlier, as shown with other types of surgeries. We wanted to see if it also worked after a CS. Chewing gum in the first 24 hours after the surgery is a simple and cheap intervention. What evidence did we find? We included randomised controlled studies published up to June 2016. We found 17 studies, with 3149 women who had just delivered by CS. In these studies, a group of women chewed gum and a second group did not, receiving usual care. The studies were conducted in nine countries (mostly low‐ to middle‐income countries) and were different in many aspects. For instance, some studies included only women having their first baby and others included women with a previous CS; some studies included only elective (pre‐scheduled) CS and others also included emergency CS. The way that gum was given also differed in the studies; in some the women started chewing gum right after the CS and in others they waited for up to 12 hours. Also, the women could not be blinded to receiving the gum. The combination of the results (in a meta‐analysis) of these studies showed that the women who chewed gum after a CS had an earlier return of their bowel function. On average, they passed gas seven hours earlier (13 studies, 2399 women). This effect was consistent for first versus repeat CS, time spent chewing gum per day, early feeding versus nothing by mouth until the return of intestinal function, elective versus non‐elective or emergency CS, and length of time after CS when gum‐chewing was initiated. The quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low. The women chewing gum were at least half as likely to have 'ileus' (a combination of symptoms such as bloating, cramping, nausea, vomiting and inability to defecate) than the women who did not chew gum (four studies, 1139 women, low‐quality evidence). Gum chewing reduced the time to first defecation to about nine hours earlier (11 studies, 2016 women, very low‐quality evidence) and the time to hospital discharge by some eight hours (seven studies, 1489 women). Only three out of 925 women complained about having to chew gum and there were no reports of adverse effects associated with gum‐chewing (eight studies, 925 women, low‐quality evidence). None of the studies assessed women's satisfaction in relation to chewing gum. The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low, mostly due to lack of blinding of the participants (the women knew they were chewing gum) and heterogeneity between the studies. What does this mean? The available evidence suggests that gum‐chewing in the first 24 hours after a CS is a well‐tolerated simple, low‐cost, safe and easy intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function, improves maternal comfort and potentially reduces hospital costs. Further research is necessary to establish the optimal regimen of gum‐chewing (when to start, number and duration of sessions per day) to enhance bowel function recovery and to assess potential adverse effects and women's satisfaction with this intervention.",CD011562
"Background Apnoea is a breathing disorder marked by the absence of airflow at the nose or mouth. In children, risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, neuromuscular disorders and craniofacial anomalies. The most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in childhood is adeno‐tonsillectomy. This approach is limited by its surgical risks, mostly in children with comorbidities and, in some patients, by recurrence that can be associated with craniofacial problems. Oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances have been used for patients who have OSAS and craniofacial anomalies because they hold the lower jaw (mandible) forwards which potentially enlarges the upper airway and increases the upper airspace, improving the respiratory function. Objectives To assess the effects of oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances for obstructive sleep apnoea in children. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 7 April 2016); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 7 April 2016); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 7 April 2016); Embase Ovid (1980 to 7 April 2016); LILACS BIREME (from 1982 to 7 April 2016); BBO BIREME (from 1986 to 7 April 2016) and SciELO Web of Science (from 1997 to 7 April 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials on 7 April 2016. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing all types of oral and functional orthopaedic appliances with placebo or no treatment, in children 15 years old or younger. Primary outcome: reduction of apnoea to less than one episode per hour. Secondary outcomes: dental and skeletal relationship, sleep parameters improvement, cognitive and phonoaudiological function, behavioural problems, quality of life, side effects (tolerability) and economic evaluation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies and extracted data independently. Authors were contacted for additional information. We calculated risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals for all important dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADEpro software. Main results The initial search identified 686 trials. Only one trial, reporting the results from a total of 23 children and comparing an oral appliance to no treatment, was suitable for inclusion in the review. The trial assessed apnoea‐hypopnoea, daytime symptoms (sleepiness, irritability, tiredness, school problems, morning headache, thirstiness in the morning, oral breathing and nasal stuffiness) and night‐time symptoms (habitual snoring, restless sleep and nightmares measured by questionnaire). Results were inconsistent across outcomes measures and time points. The evidence was considered very low quality. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children. Oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances may be considered in specified cases as an auxiliary in the treatment of children who have craniofacial anomalies which are risk factors for apnoea.","Oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances for obstructive sleep apnoea in children Review question Are oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances effective and safe for treating children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome? Background Obstructive sleep apnoea in children is a breathing disorder characterized by episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. There are various risk factors and is associated with daytime and night‐time symptoms including among others sleepiness, irritability, tiredness, morning headaches, nasal stuffiness, habitual snoring, nightmares, etc. The common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea in childhood is adeno‐tonsillectomy, the removal of the adenoids and tonsils. This approach is limited by recurrence that can be associated with craniofacial problems. Oral/functional orthopaedic appliances have been used for patients who have obstructive sleep apnoea and craniofacial anomalies because they hold the lower jaw (mandible) forwards which potentially enlarges the upper airway and increases the upper airspace, improving the respiratory function. Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 7 April 2016. It included only one study in which 32 children were randomised to receive an oral appliance or no treatment. Twenty‐three participants finished the study. Key results Treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in children appears to be possible with oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances. However, this is only based on data from one small study. Quality of the evidence This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as very low. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclude that oral or functional orthopaedic appliances are effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children.",CD005520
"Background Combining two different analgesics in fixed doses in a single tablet can provide better pain relief than either drug alone in acute pain. This appears to be broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache. A new combination of dexketoprofen (a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug) plus tramadol (an opioid) has been tested in acute postoperative pain conditions. It is not yet licensed for use. This review is one of a series on oral analgesics for acute postoperative pain. Individual reviews have been brought together in two overviews to provide information about the relative efficacy and harm of the different interventions. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single fixed‐dose of oral dexketoprofen plus tramadol, compared with placebo, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes. A secondary objective was to compare the combination with the individual analgesics alone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 31 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and two online clinical trial registries. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind trials of oral dexketoprofen plus tramadol administered as a single oral dose, for the relief of acute postoperative pain in adults, and compared to placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for dexketoprofen plus tramadol, compared with placebo with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours, the median time to use of rescue medication, and the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication. We also collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. We also collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours for dexketoprofen alone and tramadol alone. Main results We included three studies with 1853 participants who had undergone surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth, hip replacement, or hysterectomy. The overall risk of bias across the three included studies was low, with unclear risk of bias in relation to the size of the three studies. Two studies did not report all our prespecified outcomes, which limited the analyses we could do. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg was 66%, compared to 32% with placebo, giving an NNT of 3.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.7) (RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.4); 748 participants; 3 studies) (moderate quality evidence). The response rate with dexketoprofen 25 mg alone was 53% (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4); 744 participants; 3 studies) and with tramadol alone was 45% (RR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7); 741 participants; 3 studies) (moderate quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because of some inconsistency in the results. The median time to use of rescue medication could not be estimated exactly, but was probably eight hours or more, indicating a long duration of effect (moderate quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because it was not possible to estimate the effect exactly in the two multiple dose studies, resulting in imprecision. Fewer participants used rescue medication with higher doses of active treatment (summary statistic not calculated; 123 participants; 1 study) (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because the data came from a single study with few participants and events. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not reported consistently for the single dose phase of the studies. In the single dose study, 11% of participants experienced adverse events with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg, which were mostly mild or moderate nausea, vomiting, or dizziness, and typical with these medicines. Rates were lower with placebo and lower doses (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because the data came from a single study with few participants and events. Information on multiple dosing over three and five days supported a low event rate with the combination. Overall, rates were generally low in all treatment arms, as they were for withdrawals for adverse events or other reasons. Authors' conclusions A single oral dose of dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg provided good levels of pain relief with long duration of action to more people than placebo or the same dose of dexketoprofen or tramadol alone. The magnitude of the effect was similar to other good analgesics. Adverse event rates were low. There is modest uncertainty about the precision of the point estimate for efficacy, but the NNT of 3 is consistent with other analgesics considered effective and commonly used.","Fixed‐dose oral dexketoprofen plus tramadol for acute postoperative pain in adults Bottom line This review found that most people with moderate or severe pain after an operation get good pain relief from taking dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg. Background Acute pain is short‐lived pain often felt soon after injury, including after operations. Most people who have an operation have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers are tested in people with acute pain, often following the removal of wisdom teeth. This pain is usually treated with painkillers taken by mouth. We believe these results can be applied to other acute painful conditions. The use of two different painkillers in a single tablet at fixed doses has been found to provide good pain relief to a high proportion of people with moderate or severe pain after an operation. This review examined a new fixed‐dose combination of two painkillers, a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory medicine (dexketoprofen) with an opioid medicine (tramadol). Study characteristics In May 2016, we found three studies involving 1853 people. The main comparison was between the fixed‐dose of dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg and placebo (a dummy treatment). The studies tested single doses after wisdom tooth extraction, hip replacement operations, and gynaecological (female reproductive system) operations. Studies included adults over a range of ages, and 7 out of 10 participants were women. The main outcome was the number of participants having at least half of the maximum possible pain relief over the first six hours after taking the tablets. Key results All three studies reported the main outcome for dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg. There were 748 participants in the comparison with placebo. About 7 in 10 people achieved this outcome with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg, compared with 3 in 10 with placebo. The combination was significantly better than placebo, and better than either dexketoprofen or tramadol alone. The pain relief lasted a long time, probably eight hours or more, but the exact duration could not be determined. Fewer people needed to take additional painkillers with the combination treatment than with placebo. About 1 in 10 people had side effects with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg. These were mostly mild or moderate nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), and dizziness, which are typical with these medicines. Serious side effects were uncommon. Few people dropped out of the studies. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for the painkilling effect of dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg. For side effects we judged the quality of the evidence about a single dose as very low because there were so few participants and events, but we judged it as moderate when we included evidence from the three‐ and five‐day studies. Moderate quality evidence means that more information might change our estimate of the effect. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results.",CD012232
"Background Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First‐episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first‐episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first‐episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection. Data collection and analysis All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators. Main results We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) ‐3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.91 to ‐0.54; I 2  = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first‐episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies.  There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD ‐0.61 days, 95% CI ‐2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I 2  statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application.Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo. Authors' conclusions There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta‐analyse.","Treatment for the first time men and women get genital herpes (first‐episode genital herpes) Review question   The aim of this research was to look at the positive and adverse effects of treatments, on the duration of symptoms, in people who have their first episode of genital herpes. Background   Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that is primarily sexually transmitted (skin‐to‐skin contact). First‐episode genital herpes is the first time a person experiences the symptoms of genital herpes. The main feature of genital herpes are painful skin lesions. Treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the symptoms. Study characteristics   We included 26 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) trials with 2084 participants that looked at treatments for first‐episode genital herpes versus placebo or another treatment. The trials all included people who were having their first episode of genital herpes and were conducted in various countries around the world. Three of the trials included only women, and in all the trials the participants had had symptoms for eight days or less. Fifteen of the 26 trials were funded by a pharmaceutical company.    Key results     The evidence is current to April 2016. The evidence shows that oral and intravenous acyclovir may be effective in reducing the number of days of symptoms in someone with first‐episode genital herpes. Oral valaciclovir showed a similar length of symptom duration as acyclovir. We did not find enough evidence to support the use of topical treatments. There was also no evidence that any of the treatments reduced the time between episodes for people with genital herpes. The evidence presented here is mostly of low quality. The studies included were mainly conducted in the 1980s and at this time the brief way studies were reported does not allow us to adequately judge the quality of the included studies.    Quality of the evidence   The evidence provided by this review is of low quality. Although there are 26 included studies, the meta‐analyses created in this review at the most, had three included studies. This was mainly due to the low number of studies that looked at each different type of antiviral. It was also unclear as to how well the included studies were conducted, as the methods for each of the individual studies did not report enough detail to judge each study's quality, inconsistence and this also affected the overall quality of the review.",CD010684
"Background To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's  Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding  recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Concerns have been raised that offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and as a consequence may reduce breast‐milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding. Objectives To assess the effect of restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full‐term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full‐term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results We found three trials (involving 1915 babies) for inclusion in the review, but have included only two trials (involving 1302 healthy full‐term breastfeeding infants) in the analysis. Meta‐analysis of the two combined studies showed that pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants had no significant effect on the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.07, two studies, 1228 infants), and at four months of age (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09, one study, 970 infants,  moderate‐quality evidence ), and also had no effect on the proportion of infants partially breastfed at three months (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02, two studies, 1228 infants), and at four months of age (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02, one study, 970 infants). None of the included trials reported data on the other primary outcomes, i.e. duration of partial or exclusive breastfeeding, or secondary outcomes: breastfeeding difficulties (mastitis, cracked nipples, breast engorgement); infant's health (dental malocclusion, otitis media, oral candidiasis; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)); maternal satisfaction and level of confidence in parenting. One study reported that avoidance of pacifiers had no effect on cry/fuss behavior at ages four, six, or nine weeks and also reported no effect on the risk of weaning before age three months, however the data were incomplete and so could not be included for analysis. Authors' conclusions Pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants, started from birth or after lactation is established, did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive and partial breastfeeding up to four months of age. Evidence to assess the short‐term breastfeeding difficulties faced by mothers and long‐term effect of pacifiers on infants' health is lacking.","Effect of restricted pacifier use on duration of breastfeeding in full‐term infants What is the issue and why is it important? A pacifier, used to calm an infant, has become a cultural norm in many parts of the world. Unlimited pacifier use might cause nipple confusion in newborn and hence early termination of breastfeeding. We wanted to explore the effect of restricting the use of a pacifier on the duration of breastfeeding. What evidence did we find? We updated the search on 30 June 2016. We identified three studies, with a total of 1915 babies. One study could not be included in the analysis and so findings are based on two studies involving 1302 infants. The mothers in the studies were motivated to breastfeed recruited immediately after birth and at two weeks of life, respectively. We found that unrestricted use of a pacifier did not affect the proportion of infants exclusive or partial breastfeeding at three and four months. The studies were remarkably consistent. We judged this to be  moderate‐quality evidence . There was no information on the effect of pacifier use on any breastfeeding difficulties experienced by the mothers, maternal satisfaction, infant crying and fussing and infant problems such as otitis media and dental malocclusion. What does this mean? In motivated mothers, there is  moderate‐quality evidence  that pacifier use in healthy term breastfeeding infants before and after lactation is established does not reduce the duration of breastfeeding up to four months of age. However, there is insufficient information on the potential harms of pacifiers on infants and mothers. Until further information becomes available on the effects of pacifiers on the infant, mothers who are well‐motivated to breastfeed should be encouraged to make a decision on the use of a pacifier based on personal preference.",CD007202
"Background Obesity has reached epidemic proportions around the world. Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or to greater body mass or body fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower body mass index (BMI) or weight. Search methods Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies. Selection criteria All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m 2 ). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life‐table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with levonorgestrel and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing levonorgestrel and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the ""treatment‐compliant"" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six‐capsule levonorgestrel implant showed differences in pregnancy by weight. One study showed higher weight was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower weight groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more. Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or obesity. These included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous), levonorgestrel IUC, the two‐rod levonorgestrel implant, and the etonogestrel implant. Authors' conclusions The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or weight and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than weight alone, can provide information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen. We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non‐randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.","Hormones for birth control in overweight or obese women Excess body weight has become a health problem around the world. Being overweight or obese may affect how well some birth control methods work to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal birth control includes pills, the skin patch, the vaginal ring, implants, injectables, and hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC). Until 4 August 2016, we did computer searches for studies of hormonal birth control among women who were overweight or obese. We looked for studies that compared overweight or obese women with women of normal weight or body mass index (BMI). The formula for BMI is weight (kg) / height (m) 2 . We included all study designs. For the original review, we wrote to investigators to find other studies we might have missed. With 8 studies added in this update, we had 17 with a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies with high, moderate, or low quality results. Most did not show more pregnancies for overweight or obese women. Two of five studies using birth control pills found differences between BMI groups. In one, overweight women had a higher pregnancy risk. The other found a lower pregnancy rate for obese women versus nonobese women. The second study also tested a new skin patch. Obese women in the patch group had a higher pregnancy rate. Of five implant studies, two showed differences among weight groups. They studied the older six‐capsule implant. One study showed a higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined for women weighing 70 kg or more. The other reported pregnancy differences in year 5 among the lower weight groups only. Results for other methods of birth control did not show overweight or obesity related to pregnancy rate. Those methods included an injectable, hormonal IUC, and the two‐rod and single‐rod implants. These studies generally did not show an association of BMI or weight with the effect of hormonal methods. We found few studies for most methods. Studies using BMI rather than weight can show whether body fat is related to how well birth control prevents pregnancy. The methods studied here work very well when used according to directions. The overall study quality was low for this review, especially in the older reports. However, many studies would have higher quality for their original purpose than for the comparisons here.",CD008452
"Background The ideal intravenous fluid for kidney transplantation has not been defined, despite the common use of normal saline during the peri‐operative period. The high chloride content of normal saline is associated with an increased risk of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, which may in turn increase the risk of hyperkalaemia and delayed graft function. Balanced electrolyte solutions have a lower chloride content which may decrease this risk and avoid the need for dialysis due to hyperkalaemia in the immediate post‐transplant period. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing this issue have used biochemical outcomes to compare fluids and have been underpowered to address patient‐centred outcomes such as delayed graft function. Objectives To examine the effect of lower‐chloride solutions versus normal saline on delayed graft function, hyperkalaemia and acid‐base status in kidney transplant recipients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 26 November 2015 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria RCTs of kidney transplant recipients that compared peri‐operative intravenous lower‐chloride solutions to normal saline were included. Data collection and analysis Two independent investigators assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. Data from individual studies were extracted using standardised forms and pooled according to a published protocol. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Main results Six studies (477 participants) were included in the review. All participants were adult kidney transplant recipients and 70% of participants underwent live‐donor kidney transplantation. The overall risk of bias was low for selection bias and unclear for remaining domains. There was no difference in the risk of delayed graft function (3 studies, 298 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.70) or hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 199 participants: RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.04 to 6.10) for participants who received balanced electrolyte solutions compared to normal saline. Intraoperative balanced electrolyte solutions compared to normal saline were associated with higher blood pH (3 studies, 193 participants: MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), higher serum bicarbonate (3 studies, 215 participants: MD 3.02 mEq/L, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.05) and lower serum chloride (3 studies, 215 participants: MD ‐9.93 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐19.96 to 0.11). There were four cases of graft loss in the normal saline group and one in the balanced electrolyte solution group, and four cases of acute rejection in the normal saline group compared to two cases in the balanced electrolyte solution group. Authors' conclusions Balanced electrolyte solutions are associated with less hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis compared to normal saline, however it remains uncertain whether lower‐chloride solutions lead to improved graft outcomes compared to normal saline.","Normal saline versus lower‐chloride solutions for kidney transplantation What is the issue? People with kidney failure may have a kidney transplant to replace the function of their own kidneys. During a kidney transplant operation, patients receive fluids through their veins to keep them hydrated. Maintaining good hydration helps the transplanted kidney to work after the operation. The choice of fluids that are given during and after the operation may have an effect on how the transplant kidney works after surgery and on the patient's acid‐base measures in the blood. Normal saline is a type of fluid that is commonly given during an operation. It contains a high chloride level. Giving a kidney transplant patient normal saline might increase the acid level of the blood compared to giving the patient fluids that contain less chloride. High blood acid levels might be associated with high blood potassium levels, which is dangerous for the heart and often requires dialysis to correct. What did we do? We performed a systematic review to address the question of whether giving lower‐chloride fluids compared to normal saline during the kidney transplant operation alters the early function of the kidney, the number of patients with high blood potassium levels, and the acid level in the blood after the operation. We included studies that were published up to November 26, 2015. What did we find? We found six studies that included 477 kidney transplant patients. The majority of these patients had a kidney transplant from a living donor. The overall quality of the studies was low to average, and the main problem was the small number of studies and the small size of the studies. There was no information on funding source for most of the studies. Compared to normal saline, giving kidney transplant patients solutions that contain less chloride during their transplant operation resulted in lower blood acid levels but did not affect how the transplant kidney worked after surgery, or the number of patients who had high blood potassium levels. Harmful effects were not reported in many studies. In the group of patients who were given lower‐chloride fluids, the transplant failed in one patient and one patient rejected the transplant. In the group of patients who were given normal saline, the transplant failed in four patients, and two patients rejected the transplant. However, this is probably an incomplete picture of harmful effects.",CD010741
"Background End‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic, debilitative and progressive illness that may need interventions such as dialysis, transplantation, dietary and fluid restrictions. Most patients with ESKD will require renal replacement therapy, such as kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Advance care planning traditionally encompass instructions via living wills, and concern patient preferences about interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and feeding tubes, or circumstances around assigning surrogate decision makers. Most people undergoing haemodialysis are not aware of advance care planning and few patients formalise their wishes as advance directives and of those who do, many do not discuss their decisions with a physician. Advance care planning involves planning for future healthcare decisions and preferences of the patient in advance while comprehension is intact. It is an essential part of good palliative care that likely improves the lives and deaths of haemodialysis patients. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine whether advance care planning in haemodialysis patients, compared with no or less structured forms of advance care planning, can result in fewer hospital admissions or less use of treatments with life‐prolonging or curative intent, and if patient's wishes were followed at end‐of‐life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 27 June 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Social Work Abstracts (OvidSP). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at advance care planning versus no form of advance care planning in haemodialysis patients was considered for inclusion without language restriction. Data collection and analysis Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were highlighted. Non‐randomised controlled studies were excluded. Main results We included two studies (three reports) that involved 337 participants which investigated advance care planning for people with ESKD. Neither of the included studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Study quality was assessed as suboptimal. Authors' conclusions We found sparse data that were assessed at suboptimal quality and therefore we were unable to formulate conclusions about whether advance care planning can influence numbers of hospital admissions and treatment required by people with ESKD, or if patients' advance care directives were followed at end‐of‐life. Further well designed and adequately powered RCTs are needed to better inform patient and clinical decision‐making about advance care planning and advance directives among people with ESKD who are undergoing dialysis.","Advance care planning for haemodialysis patients Background People with chronic kidney disease and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) have irreversible kidney damage and require renal replacement therapy. In developed countries, haemodialysis has become the most common treatment for people with ESKD. Despite its life‐saving potential, haemodialysis can be a significant physical and psychological burden to patients. Advance care planning is the process of planning for a person’s future health and personal care decisions in terms of level of healthcare and quality of life the person would want, should for any reason, the person becomes unable to participate in decision‐making. Advance care goals can change over time and advance care planning assists in addressing these changes and readdress care goals over time. This helps to ensure that individual choices are respected in future medical treatment in an event where the person cannot communicate or make decisions. We wanted to find out if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among people with ESKD in terms of use of resuscitation measures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and withdrawal from dialysis. Additionally, we wanted to find out whether patient wishes were followed in the end of life period. Study characteristics We searched the literature up to June 2016 and found two studies (three reports) that involved 337 patients which investigated use of patient‐centred advanced care planning (PC‐ACP) and peer mentoring interventions. Key results Neither study addressed our questions concerning use of life‐prolonging treatments such as resuscitation, death in hospital or withdrawal from dialysis. It remains uncertain if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among ESKD patients. More research is required to better inform use of PC‐ACP for people receiving haemodialysis treatment.",CD010737
"Background Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. Complete resection of the whole tumor remains the only approach to treat this malignant disease. Since gastric cancer is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, many people are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is inoperable. In addition, because other conventional treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) have only modest efficacy for those with advanced/metastatic gastric cancer, the prognosis in such cases is poor. Recently, trials have provided some promising results regarding molecular‐targeted therapy, raising the possibility that the development of these agents could be a fruitful approach. However, the benefit of molecular‐targeted therapy for advanced gastric cancer remains inconclusive. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of molecular‐targeted therapy , either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in people with advanced gastric cancer. Search methods We searched the following databases (from inception to December 2015): the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (aged 18 years or older) with histologically‐confirmed advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach/gastro‐esophageal junction. Trials of participants with esophageal adenocarcinoma were also considered to be eligible. The eligible trials should aim to evaluate the effects of molecular‐targeted agents on participants' prognosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed selection of eligible trials, assessment of trial quality, and data extraction. We used methods of survival analysis and expressed the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR) when pooling time‐to‐event data, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included 11 studies randomizing 4014 participants to molecular‐targeted therapy plus conventional chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Five were at low risk of bias, and we considered the risk of bias in the other six studies to be high, mainly due to their open‐label design. All identified studies reported data regarding survival. We found low‐quality evidence that molecular‐targeted may have a small effect on mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05, 10 studies) compared with conventional chemotherapy alone. Similarly, it may have little effect on progression‐free survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04, 11 studies; low‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence from subgroup analysis that survival outcomes differed by type of molecular‐targeted agent (EGFR‐ or VEGF‐targeting agents) or tumor type, meaning that we were unable to explain the variation in effect across the studies by the presence or absence of prognostic biomarkers or type of molecular‐targeted agent. From 11 eligible trials, we were able to use data from 3723 participants with measurable tumors. We found low‐quality evidence that molecular‐targeted therapy may increase tumor response (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.55, low‐quality evidence). Data from one small trial were too limited to determine the effect of treatment on quality of life (very low‐quality evidence). The addition of targeted therapy to chemotherapy probably increases the risk of adverse events (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.92, 5 trials, 2290 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) and severe adverse event (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37, 8 trials, 3800 participants), compared with receiving chemotherapy alone. Authors' conclusions There is uncertainty about the effect of adding targeted therapy to chemotherapy on survival outcomes in people with advanced gastric cancer, with very little information on its impact on quality of life. There is more certain evidence of increased risk of adverse events and serious adverse events. The main limitation of the evidence for survival outcomes was inconsistency of effects across the studies, which we could not explain by prespecified subgroups in terms of the type of therapy or tumor type. Ongoing studies in this area are small and unlikely to improve our understanding of the effects of targeted therapy, and larger studies are needed.","Effect of molecular‐targeted therapy on the progress and survival of people in the late stages of stomach cancer Review question Does molecular‐targeted therapy (a type of treatment specifically targeting cancer cells) benefit people with late‐stage stomach cancer? Background Due to the lack of clinical symptoms, many stomach cancers are diagnosed at a very late stage (stage III or stage IV), for which surgery cannot be the best option anymore. The effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on late‐stage stomach cancer are very limited, leading to a low possibility of survival for people with the disease (fewer than one in five people survive for longer than five years). Recent research suggested that molecular‐targeted therapy may prolong the survival time for people with late‐stage stomach cancer. However, the therapeutic benefit of this treatment is still under debate. Study characteristics We searched databases until December 2015 for randomized controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) in adults (aged 18 years or over), diagnosed with late‐stage stomach cancer. We found 11 trials (4014 participants) that met our selection requirements and randomized people to receive targeted treatment plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Key results Adding molecular‐targeted treatment to chemotherapy may have a small effect on survival and on stopping further development of the disease, compared with chemotherapy alone, but the evidence is of low quality. The treatment may increase the likelihood that tumors get smaller (low‐quality evidence), but there is insufficient evidence to know how much of a difference it can make to the person's quality of life (very low‐quality evidence). It probably increases the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events (moderate‐quality evidence). Quality of the evidence Currently, the evidence is of low quality for survival outcomes, mainly due to the type of study design, and the inconsistencies between the results of individual studies. We therefore suggest that well‐designed clinical trials should be performed, to improve the evidence base.",CD011461
"Background Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic drug from the phenothiazine group of antipsychotics. It has been commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, however, with the advent of atypical antipsychotic medications, use has declined over the years. Objectives To measure the outcomes (both beneficial and harmful) of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of oral fluphenazine versus atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (25 April 2013). For the economic search, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on 31 January 2014 Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine (oral) with any other oral atypical antipsychotics. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently to inspect citations and assess the quality of the studies and to extract data. For homogeneous dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and calculated the mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results Four studies randomising a total of 202 people with schizophrenia are included. Oral fluphenazine was compared with oral amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine. Comparing oral fluphenazine with amisulpride, there was no difference between groups for mental state using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 5.10 95% CI ‐2.35 to 12.55,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor was there any difference in numbers leaving the study early for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 98, RR 1.19 95% CI 0.63 to 2.28,  very low‐quality evidence ). More people required concomitant anticholinergic medication in the fluphenazine group compared to amisulpride (1 RCT, n = 36, RR 7.82 95% CI 1.07 to 57.26,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for important outcomes including relapse, changes in life skills, quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. Comparing oral fluphenazine with risperidone, data showed no difference between groups for 'clinically important response' (1 RCT, n = 26, RR 0.67 95% CI 0.13 to 3.35,  very low‐quality evidence ) nor leaving the study early due to inefficacy (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 1.08 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported data for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Once again there was no difference when oral fluphenazine was compared with quetiapine for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.62 95% CI 0.12 to 3.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor leaving the study early for any reason (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.46 95% CI 0.05 to 4.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; clinically important change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Compared to olanzapine, fluphenazine showed no superiority for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.86 to 2.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), in incidence of akathisia (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.90 to 10.01,  very low‐quality evidence ) or in people leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.33 to 27.23,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; or cost‐effectiveness. Authors' conclusions Measures of clinical response and mental state do not highlight differences between fluphenazine and amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Largely measures of adverse effects are also unconvincing for substantive differences between fluphenazine and the newer drugs. All included trials carry a substantial risk of bias regarding reporting of adverse effects and this bias would have favoured the newer drugs. The four small short included studies do not provide much clear information about the relative merits  or disadvantages  of oral fluphenazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics.","Comparing effectiveness of an older antipsychotic (oral fluphenazine) with newer antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia Introduction   People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). It is a distressing and debilitating illness. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic drug first formulated in the 1950s, effective for treating the psychoses of schizophrenia. However fluphenazine can cause some serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, and is known to lower people’s mood. Fluphenazine is inexpensive but the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs with fewer movement disorder side effects reduced its use and market share. Methods   An electronic search of Cochrane Schizophrenia's register of studies was carried out in 2013. Review authors looked for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either oral fluphenazine or an atypical antipsychotic. Four studies with a total of 202 people with schizophrenia could be included. The trials compared fluphenazine with either amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Results   Data showed oral fluphenazine is no better or worse in improving mental state than amisulpride but more people receiving oral fluphenazine did need to take additional anticholinergic medication (drugs used to help relieve a range of symptoms such as involuntary movements of the muscles, high blood pressure and insomnia). Data from the trials comparing oral fluphenazine with either risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine also showed no superiority between the treatment groups for clinical improvement. Only the trial comparing oral fluphenazine with olanzapine provided adverse‐effects data. Again, incidence of akathisia, a movement disorder, was similar between treatment groups. Quality of evidence   Evidence from these few trials is poor, of low quality and involves a small number of participants. It does not provide clear overall information about whether oral fluphenazine is better or worse than atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Data were not available for important outcomes such as such, relapse, hospital admission, satisfaction, costs and quality of life. Adverse‐effects data were poorly reported. Future large‐scale research should report on these important outcomes. Conclusions   Fluphenazine is low cost and widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials about its effectiveness compared to atypical antipsychotics is unclear.",CD010832
"Background Ovarian cancer is seventh most common cancer in women worldwide. Approximately 1.3% of women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point during their life time. The majority of tumours arise from surface of the ovary (epithelial). Two thirds of these women will present with advanced disease, requiring aggressive treatment, which includes debulking surgery (removal of as much disease as possible) and chemotherapy. However, most women (75%) with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) will relapse following surgery and chemotherapy. Patients who relapse are treated with either platinum or non‐platinum drugs and this is dependent on the platinum‐sensitivity and platinum‐free interval. These drug regimens are generally well‐tolerated although there are potential severe side effects. New treatments that can be used to treat recurrence or prevent disease progression after first‐line or subsequent chemotherapy are important, especially those with a low toxicity profile. Hormones such as luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists have been used in the treatment of relapsed EOC. Some studies have shown objective remissions, while other studies have shown little or no benefit. Most small studies report a better side‐effect profile for LHRH agonists when compared to standard chemotherapeutic agents used in EOC. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists with chemotherapeutic agents or placebo in relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase up to January 2016. We also searched registers of clinical trials and abstracts of scientific meetings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared LHRH agonists with chemotherapeutic agents or placebo in relapsed EOC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, retrieved data and assessed risk of bias. Main results Two studies, including 97 women, met our inclusion criteria: one assessed LHRH agonist (leuprorelin) use in relapsed (platinum‐resistant and platinum‐refractory) EOC in comparison with a chemotherapeutic agent (treosulfan) (Du Bois 2002); the other examined LHRH agonist (decapeptyl) versus a placebo (Currie 1994). Since both studies had different control groups, a meta‐analysis was not possible. There may be little or no difference between treatment with leuprorelin or treosulfan in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.67;  very   low‐quality evidence ) or progression‐free survival (PFS) at six and 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.68, and RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.66;  very   low‐quality evidence ), respectively (Du Bois 2002). The duration of follow‐up was 2.5 years and quality of life (QoL) was not reported in this study. Alopecia and fatigue were probably more common with treosulfan than leuprorelin (alopecia RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.91  (very low‐quality evidence) ). There may be little or no difference in other Grade 3/4 side effects: nausea and vomiting (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.66 ( very low‐quality evidence )); neurotoxicity (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.71 ( very low‐quality evidence )) and neutropenia (RR 0.97, 95% 0.06 to 14.97 ( very low‐quality evidence )), The Currie 1994 study, which compared decapeptyl treatment with placebo, reported mean PFS of 16 weeks verus 11.2 weeks, respectively. No relative effects measures or P value at a particular time point were reported. Overall survival (OS) and QoL outcomes were not reported. In addition, adverse events were only mentioned for the decapeptyl group. Adverse events were incompletely reported (no adverse events in decapeptyl group, but not reported for the placebo group). Authors' conclusions Based on this review of two small RCTs, there is not enough evidence to comment on the safety and effectiveness of LHRH agonists in the treatment of platinum‐refractory and platinum‐resistant (relapsed) EOC. Overall, the quality of evidence for all outcomes (including OS, PFS, QoL and adverse events) is very low.","The use of hormonal treatment in relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer Background Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) arises from the cells covering the surface of the ovary. The majority of women with this type of cancer present with advanced stage disease at diagnosis. The initial treatment involves surgery (removal of as much disease as possible) followed by chemotherapy. In some cases chemotherapy is given to shrink the cancer before surgery is undertaken. Irrespective of the type of treatment received, cancer will return at some point in some women. Treatment following relapse, usually involves chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy depends on the cancer‐free period from the initial chemotherapy (platinum drugs). If relapse occurs after six months from finishing initial treatment with chemotherapy, women are treated with platinum drugs. However if the cancer recurs within six months, women are treated with non‐platinum drugs, since platinum drugs would be unlikely to work again. Eventually, the majority of women develop resistance to any chemotherapeutic drug. Some women also suffer from drug‐related side effects and poor quality of life (QoL) as a result of treatment. Therefore, there is a need for newer drug treatments with fewer side effects. In this context, hormone therapy have been tried. Luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist are hormones that work by telling the pituitary gland located in the brain to stop producing this hormone and as a result the tumour cells in the ovary, which may be dependent on this hormone, cannot be stimulated. LHRH agonists have been used in relapsed EOC and some studies have shown low toxicity with these hormones. Review question We conducted this review to assess whether hormonal therapy (LHRH agonist) was effective and safe compared with chemotherapy or placebo in women with relapsed EOC. Main findings We searched electronic databases and other resources for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LHRH agonists with chemotherapy or placebo in women with relapsed EOC.Two RCTs were identified. Since the comparisons differed, they were reported separately. Available evidence did not show improvement in overall survival and progression‐free survival at six and12 months with hormonal (LHRH) therapy. Also, major side effects (haematological and neurological) did not statistically differ between the two treatment groups, but were incompletely reported. Quality of life data were not reported in either study. Quality of evidence Currently, the quality of evidence is very low regarding the effectiveness and safety of LHRH agonists in women who relapse within six months of initial platinum chemotherapy treatment.",CD011322
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2011. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most commonly prescribed analgesic for the treatment of acute pain. It may be administered orally, rectally, or intravenously. The efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) formulations of paracetamol, IV paracetamol, and IV propacetamol (a prodrug that is metabolized to paracetamol), compared with placebo and other analgesics, is unclear. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of IV formulations of paracetamol for the treatment of postoperative pain in both adults and children. Search methods We ran the search for the previous review in May 2010. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (May 2010 to 16 February 2016), EMBASE (May 2010 to 16 February 2016), LILACS (2010 to 2016), a clinical trials registry, and reference lists of reviews for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any language and we retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐ or active‐controlled single dose clinical trials of IV paracetamol or IV propacetamol for acute postoperative pain in adults or children. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data, which included demographic variables, type of surgery, interventions, efficacy, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. We graded each included study for methodological quality by assessing risk of bias and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Main results We included 75 studies (36 from the original review and 39 from our updated review) enrolling a total of 7200 participants. Among primary outcomes, 36% of participants receiving IV paracetamol/propacetamol experienced at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared with 16% of those receiving placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) = 5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7 to 5.6, high quality evidence). The proportion of participants in IV paracetamol/propacetamol groups experiencing at least 50% pain relief diminished over six hours, as reflected in a higher NNT of 6 (4.6 to 7.1, moderate quality evidence). Mean pain intensity at four hours was similar when comparing IV paracetamol and placebo, but was seven points lower on a 0 to 100 visual analog scale (0 = no pain, 100 = worst pain imaginable, 95% CI ‐9 to ‐6, low quality evidence) in those receiving paracetamol at six hours. For secondary outcomes, participants receiving IV paracetamol/propacetamol required 26% less opioid over four hours and 16% less over six hours (moderate quality evidence) than those receiving placebo. However, this did not translate to a clinically meaningful reduction in opioid‐induced adverse events. Meta‐analysis of efficacy comparisons between IV paracetamol/propacetamol and active comparators (e.g., opioids or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs) were either not statistically significant, not clinically significant, or both. Adverse events occurred at similar rates with IV paracetamol or IV propacetamol and placebo. However, pain on infusion occurred more frequently in those receiving IV propacetamol versus placebo (23% versus 1%). Meta‐analysis did not demonstrate clinically meaningful differences between IV paracetamol/propacetamol and active comparators for any adverse event. Authors' conclusions Since the last version of this review, we have found 39 new studies providing additional information. Most included studies evaluated adults only. We reanalyzed the data but the results did not substantially alter any of our previously published conclusions. This review provides high quality evidence that a single dose of either IV paracetamol or IV propacetamol provides around four hours of effective analgesia for about 36% of patients with acute postoperative pain. Low to very low quality evidence demonstrates that both formulations are associated with few adverse events, although patients receiving IV propacetamol have a higher incidence of pain on infusion than both placebo and IV paracetamol.","Intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) for pain after surgery in adults and children Background Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures and multiple medications (e.g., painkillers) are routinely used to control it. In February 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at intravenous (IV) formulations (solutions that can be administered directly into a vein) of paracetamol (either IV paracetamol or IV propacetamol) and how they might manage pain after surgery. Results and quality of the evidence Our updated review included data from 75 studies of 7200 patients with moderate‐to‐severe pain after an operation. We found high quality evidence that IV paracetamol or IV propacetamol provided pain relief for four hours for about 36% of people versus 16% of those receiving placebo. Direct comparisons with other painkillers, such as morphine and anti‐inflammatories, did not show large differences (if any) in effectiveness, although this may have been due to the small numbers of patients studied. Low quality evidence showed that IV paracetamol and IV propacetamol produced few side effects. However, patients receiving IV propacetamol complained of pain at the site their medication was infused at more often than those receiving placebo or IV paracetamol. Due to the amount of data already included in our review, we think it is unlikely that any new studies will change our conclusions. However, we found very few studies that included children, so this is an area that requires further investigation.",CD007126
"Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and is a leading cause of cancer death among women. Prophylactic or curative mastectomy is often followed by breast reconstruction for which there are several surgical approaches that use breast implants with which surgeons can restore the natural feel, size and shape of the breast. Objectives To assess the effects of different types of breast implants on capsular contracture, surgical short‐ and long‐term complications, postoperative satisfaction level and quality of life in women who have undergone reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register on 20 July 2015, MEDLINE (1985 to 20 July 2015), EMBASE (1985 to 20 July 2015) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 8, 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared different types of breast implants for reconstructive surgery. We considered the following types of intervention: implant envelope surfaces ‐ texturised versus smooth; implant filler material ‐ silicone versus saline, PVP‐Hydrogel versus saline; implant shape ‐ anatomical versus round; implant volume ‐ variable versus fixed; brands ‐ different implant manufacturing companies and implant generation (fifth versus previous generations). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Main results Five RCTs with 202 participants met the inclusion criteria. The women participants were typically in their 50s, and the majority of them (about 82%) received reconstructive surgery following breast cancer, while the others had reconstructive surgery after prophylactic mastectomy. The studies were heterogenous in terms of implant comparisons, which prevented us from pooling the data. The studies were judged as being at an unclear risk of bias for most risk of bias items owing to poor quality of reporting in the trial publications. Three of the five RCTs were judged to be at high risk of attrition bias, and one at high risk of detection bias. Textured silicone versus smooth silicone implants: textured implants were associated with worse outcomes when compared to smooth implants (capsular contracture: risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.14 to 4.71; 1 study, 20 participants;  very low quality evidence;  reintervention: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.14 to 4.71; 1 study, 20 participants;  very low quality evidence ). No results in this comparison were statistically significant. Silicone versus saline implants: saline‐filled implants performed better than silicone‐filled implants for some outcomes; specifically, they produced less severe capsular contracture (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.24 to 8.51; 1 study, 60 participants;  very low quality evidence ) and increased patient satisfaction (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; 1 study, 58 participants;  very low quality evidence ). However reintervention was significantly more frequent in the saline‐filled implant group than in the silicone‐filled group (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.43; 1 study, 60 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Poly(N‐vinyl‐2‐pyrrolidone) hydrogel‐filled (PVP‐hydrogel) versus saline‐filled implants: PVP‐hydrogel‐filled implants were associated with worse outcomes when compared to saline‐filled implants (capsular contracture: RR 3.50, 95% CI 0.83 to 14.83; 1 study, 40 participants;  very low quality evidence ; short‐term complications: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.21 to 21.39; 1 study, 41 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Anatomical versus round implants: anatomical implants were associated with worse outcomes than round implants (capsular contracture: RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 20.15; 1 study, 36 participants;  very low quality evidence ; short‐term complications: RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 9.58; 1 study, 36 participants;  very low quality evidence;  reintervention: RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.43; 1 study, 36 participants;  very low quality evidence ). No results in this comparison were statistically significant. Variable‐volume versus fixed‐volume implants: data about one‐stage reconstruction using variable‐volume implants were compared with data about fixed‐volume implants positioned during the second surgical procedure of two‐stage reconstructions. Fixed‐volume implant reconstructions were possibly associated with a greater number of women reporting that their reconstruction corresponded with expected results (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62; 1 study, 40 participants;  very low quality evidence ) and fewer reinterventions (RR 7.00, 95% CI 1.82 to 26.89; 1 study, 40 participants;  very low quality evidence ) when compared to variable‐volume implants. A higher patient satisfaction level (rated from 1 to 6, with 1 being very bad and 6 being very good) was found with the fixed‐volume implants for overall aesthetic result (mean difference (MD) ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐1.59 to ‐0.61; 1 study, 40 participants;  very low quality evidence ). There were no studies that examined the effects of recent (fifth) generation silicone implants versus previous generations or different implant manufacturing companies. Authors' conclusions Despite the central role of breast reconstruction in women with breast cancer, the best implants to use in reconstructive surgery have been studied rarely in the context of RCTs. Furthermore the quality of these studies and the overall evidence they provide is largely unsatisfactory. Some of our results can be interpreted as early evidence of potentially large differences between different surgical approaches, which should be confirmed in new high‐quality RCTs that include a larger number of women. These days ‐ even after a few million women have had breasts reconstructed ‐ surgeons cannot inform women about the risks and complications of different implant‐based breast reconstructive options on the basis of results derived from RCTs.","Different types of implants for reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy Review question We assessed the effects of different types of breast implants on short‐term and long‐term surgical complications, cosmetic outcomes, satisfaction with the surgical procedure and the quality of life in women undergoing breast reconstruction following a mastectomy (breast removal). Background An estimated 28% to 60% of women affected by breast cancer will undergo a mastectomy (i.e. surgical removal of the breast). Following a mastectomy, women can choose from many breast reconstruction options and achieve a natural feel with appropriate size and shape of the breast, according to individual needs. These reconstruction options are also available for the increasing number of women at high risk of developing hereditary breast cancer who undergo risk‐reducing mastectomy. Options include implants that are silicone‐filled (filled with an inert, man‐made polymer in gel form), saline‐filled (a silicone shell, filled with sterile salt water), anatomically shaped or round, textured or smooth, and of fixed‐volume or variable‐volume. We wanted to examine if different types of breast implants are associated with better or worse surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Study characteristics The evidence is current to July 2015. We conducted a review to compare short‐ and long‐term surgical complications (such as scar tissue forming around the implant and squeezing it ‐ referred to as 'capsular contracture', and 'implant rupture'), cosmetic outcomes, women's postoperative quality of life and satisfaction with different types of breast implants used in breast reconstruction. We found five randomised studies involving 202 women that provided data for five different comparisons: rough versus smooth surface, implant filler materials compared to each other (silicone versus saline, and hydrogel versus saline), anatomical versus round shape, and variable‐ versus fixed‐volume. Four studies included women who received a mastectomy for breast cancer and one study included women who had bilateral mastectomies for preventive purposes. The authors of two studies reported that they did not have competing interests; the authors of three studies did not report this information. Three studies reported that their studies received financial support from research foundations; the other studies did not report any information regarding the source of their funding. Key results Only two studies reported differences between types of implants for some of the outcomes we considered. One study on 65 women compared silicone‐filled implants with saline‐filled implants and showed that saline implants resulted in fewer cases of capsular contracture and a higher number of women who were satisfied with the reconstructed breast. However more women in the saline‐filled implant group required further operations on the reconstructed breast than in the silicone‐filled implant group. Another study on 40 women compared variable‐volume implants (inserted in a single surgical procedure) with fixed‐volume implants (inserted in the second of two separate surgical procedures) and showed that there were significantly higher satisfaction levels and significantly lower reoperation rates with the fixed‐volume implants. The remaining three studies reported on the following comparisons: rough versus smooth silicone‐filled implants (20 women), PVP‐hydrogel versus saline‐filled implants (41 women) and anatomically shaped versus round implants (36 women). These studies reported no differences between implant types for outcomes such as capsular contracture, other short‐term complications or reoperation rates. There were no studies that compared recent generation silicone implants with earlier versions or implants from different manufacturing companies. Quality of the evidence The evidence we found was limited: only a negligible, tiny fraction of women who undergo breast reconstruction have been studied in randomised controlled trials. The quality of evidence is very low, as the studies we identified suffered from major methodological limitations. Despite the fact that several million women have had their breasts reconstructed over the last 20 years, the small number of studies and the low numbers of women included in these studies does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusions about the which is the best type of breast implant. This lack of evidence should be discussed when informing women about the risks and complications of different implant‐based breast reconstruction options. There is a need for further studies, which include a larger number of women and compare different types of implants, to free women from decisions made on the basis of surgical opinion alone.",CD010895
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review, published in 2009, Issue 2. Kleine‐Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder that mainly affects adolescent men. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, usually accompanied by hyperphagia, cognitive and mood disturbances, abnormal behaviour, such as hypersexuality, and signs of dysautonomia. In 1990, the diagnostic criteria for Kleine‐Levin syndrome were modified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, where KLS was defined as a syndrome comprised of recurring episodes of undue sleepiness lasting some days, which may or may not be associated with hyperphagia and abnormal behaviour. According to the International Classification of Sleepiness Disorders, 3rd version (ICSD‐3), revised in 2014, the Kleine‐Levin syndrome is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia that last from two days to four weeks, with at least annual recurrence, and hyperphagia (rapid consumption of a large amount of food), usually with onset in early adolescence in males but occasionally in later life and in women. A monosymptomatic form of the disorder with hypersomnia only can occur without binge eating or hypersexuality. The cause of Kleine‐Levin syndrome remains unknown, and several treatment strategies have been used. Some medications have been reported to provide benefit in the treatment of patients with KLS, but because of the rarity of the condition, no long‐term follow‐up therapies have yet been described. Objectives This review aimed to evaluate: 1. whether pharmacological treatment for Kleine Levin syndrome was effective and safe.  2. which drug or category of drugs was effective and safe. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the following sources: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (7 April 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online CRSO (7 April 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to April 2016); LILACS (7 April 2016);  ClinicalTrials.gov  (7 April 2016);  WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP  (7 April 2016); reference lists of sleep medicine textbooks; review articles and reference lists of articles identified by the search strategies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials looking at pharmacological interventions for Kleine‐Levin syndrome were eligible. We had planned to include both parallel‐group and cross‐over studies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (MMO and CC) had planned to extract the data reported in the original articles. Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Authors' conclusions Therapeutic trials of pharmacological treatment for Kleine‐Levin syndrome with a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled design are needed.","Pharmacological treatment for Kleine‐Levin syndrome Background Kleine‐Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder that mainly affects adolescent men. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), hyperphagia (overeating), and abnormal behaviour. The frequency and nature of the attacks can disrupt the individual's social, professional, and family life. The cause of KLS is not known. Several treatments have been used, including stimulant, anti‐epileptic, anti‐depressant, and anti‐psychotic drugs, with some benefit reported, but because of the rarity of the condition, long‐term follow‐up of participants is difficult. Objectives The authors of this review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for Kleine‐Levin syndrome. Results We were not able to find any RCTs. Good‐quality evidence is therefore lacking, and therapeutic trials with a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled design are needed. The evidence was current to 7 April 2016.",CD006685
"Background This review is one of a suite of six Cochrane reviews looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition involving inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms. Objectives To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment or compared with other pharmacological interventions. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQL), patient‐reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included eight RCTs (474 randomised participants), which compared oral corticosteroids with placebo or no intervention. All trials only recruited adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All trials reported outcomes at two to three weeks, at the end of the short‐course oral steroid treatment period. Three trials additionally reported outcomes at three to six months. Two of these studies prescribed intranasal steroids to patients in both arms of the trial at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. Oral steroids  versus  placebo or no intervention Disease‐specific health‐related quality of life  was reported by one study. This study reported improved quality of life after treatment (two to three weeks) in the group receiving oral steroids compared with the group who received placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.92 to ‐0.56, 40 participants, modified RSOM‐31), which corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be  low quality  (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). Disease severity   as measured by patient‐reported symptom scores was reported by two studies, which allowed the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, hyposmia) to be combined into one score. The results at the end of treatment (two to three weeks) showed an improvement in patients receiving oral steroids compared to placebo, both when presented as a mean final value (SMD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.09 to ‐1.59, 22 participants) and as a change from baseline (SMD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐2.76 to ‐1.80, 114 participants). These correspond to large effect sizes but we assessed the evidence to be  low quality. One study (114 participants) followed patients for 10 weeks after the two‐week treatment period. All patients in both arms received intranasal steroids at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. The results showed that the initial results after treatment were not sustained (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.15, 114 participants, percentage improvement from baseline). This corresponds to a small effect size and we assessed the evidence to be  low quality. There was an increase in  adverse events  in people receiving orals steroids compared with placebo for gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.78; 187 participants; three studies) and insomnia (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.95; 187 participants; three studies). There was no significant impact of oral steroids on mood disturbances at the dosage used in the included study (risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 0.55 to 11.41; 40 participants; one study). We assessed the evidence to be  low quality  due to the lack of definitions of the adverse events and the small number of events or sample size, or both). Other comparisons No studies that compared short‐course oral steroids with other treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions At the end of the treatment course (two to three weeks) there is an improvement in health‐related quality of life and symptom severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps taking oral corticosteroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding is  low.  At three to six months after the end of the oral steroid treatment period, there is little or no improvement in health‐related quality of life or symptom severity for patients taking an initial course of oral steroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The data on the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids indicate that there may be an increase in insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances but it is not clear whether there is an increase in mood disturbances. All of the adverse events results are based on  low quality  evidence. More research in this area, particularly research evaluating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, longer‐term outcomes and adverse effects, is required. There is no evidence for oral steroids compared with other treatments.","Short‐term oral corticosteroids compared with no treatment or other treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis Review question We reviewed the evidence for the benefits and harms of a short course (typically up to 21 days) of corticosteroid given by mouth to people with chronic rhinosinusitis compared with giving a placebo or no treatment, or another type of treatment. Background Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition that is defined as inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses (a group of air‐filled spaces behind the nose, eyes and cheeks). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis experience at least two or more of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks: blocked nose, discharge from their nose or runny nose, pain or pressure in their face and/or a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). Some people will also have nasal polyps, which are grape‐like swellings of the normal nasal lining inside the nasal passage and sinuses. Short courses of oral corticosteroids are a widely used treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. They work by controlling the inflammatory response and when polyps are present they rapidly reduce the size of the polyps to improve symptoms. The adverse effects of corticosteroids can include insomnia, mood changes and gastrointestinal changes (such as stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting). When given over the longer term, or through many repeated short courses, it is also possible to develop osteoporosis (fragile bones). Study characteristics This review includes evidence up to 11 August 2015. We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 474 participants. All of the patients were adults who had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All of the studies followed patients until the end of treatment (two to three weeks) and three studies (210 participants) followed up people for three to six months after the initial treatment had ended. Five of the eight reports mentioned how the trial was funded. None of the funding sources were pharmaceutical companies. Key results At the end of a two‐ or three‐week treatment course, people who took oral steroids may have had a better quality of life, less severe symptoms and smaller nasal polyps than people who had placebo or did not receive any treatment. After three to six months, there was little or no difference in quality of life, symptom severity or nasal polyps between the people who had oral steroids and the people who had placebo or no intervention. The people who took oral steroids may have had more gastrointestinal disturbances and insomnia than the people who had placebo or no intervention. It is not clear if the people who took oral steroids had more mood disturbances than the people who had placebo or no intervention. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence for oral steroids plus intranasal steroids for adults with nasal polyps to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the estimate), as the some of the results are only from one or two studies, which do not have a lot of participants. Most of the trials do not have a high risk of bias, but only people with nasal polyps were included in the review.",CD011991
"Background Fingolimod was approved in 2010 for the treatment of patients with the relapsing‐remitting (RR) form of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was designed to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and to delay disability worsening. Issues on its safety and efficacy, mainly as compared to other disease modifying drugs (DMDs), have been raised. Objectives To assess the safety and benefit of fingolimod versus placebo, or other disease‐modifying drugs (DMDs), in reducing disease activity in people with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System (CNS) Group's Specialised Trials Register and US Food and Drug Administration reports (15 February 2016). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of fingolimod versus placebo or other approved DMDs in people with RRMS. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Main results Six RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 5152 participants; 1621 controls and 3531 treated with fingolimod at different doses; 2061 with 0.5 mg, 1376 with 1.25 mg, and 94 with 5.0 mg daily. Among the controls, 923 participants were treated with placebo and 698 with others DMDs. The treatment duration was six months in three, 12 months in one, and 24 months in two trials. One study was at high risk of bias for blinding, three studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome reporting, and four studies were at high risk of bias for other reasons (co‐authors were affiliated with the pharmaceutical company). We retrieved 10 ongoing trials; four of them have been completed. Comparing fingolimod administered at the approved dose of 0.5 mg to placebo, we found that the drug at 24 months increased the probability of being relapse‐free (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.28 to 1.63); moderate quality of evidence), but it might lead to little or no difference in preventing disability progression (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; primary clinical endpoints; low quality evidence). Benefit was observed for other measures of inflammatory disease activity including clinical (annualised relapse rate): rate ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.62; moderate quality evidence; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity (gadolinium‐enhancing lesions): RR of being free from (MRI) gadolinium‐enhancing lesions: 1.36, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.45; low quality evidence.The mean change of MRI T2‐weighted lesion load favoured fingolimod at 12 and 24 months. No significant increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events was observed for fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo at six and 24 months. The risk of fingolimod discontinuation was significantly higher compared to placebo for the dose 1.25 mg at 24 months (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.52). No significant increased risk of discontinuation due to serious adverse events was observed for fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo at six and 24 months. A significant increased risk of discontinuation due to serious adverse events was found for fingolimod 5.0 mg (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.04 to 7.38) compared to placebo at six months. Comparing fingolimod 0.5 mg to intramuscular interferon beta‐1a, we found moderate quality evidence that the drug at one year slightly increased the number of participants free from relapse (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.27) or from gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.19), and decreased the relapse rate (rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70). We did not detect any advantage for preventing disability progression (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06; low quality evidence). We did not detect any significant difference for MRI T2‐weighted lesion load change. We found a greater likelihood of participants discontinuing fingolimod, as compared to other DMDs, due to adverse events in the short‐term (six months) (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.16 to 8.86), but there was no significant difference versus interferon beta‐1a at 12 months (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.80; moderate quality evidence). A higher incidence of adverse events was suggestive of the lower tolerability rate of fingolimod compared to interferon‐beta 1a. Quality of life was improved in participants after switching from a different DMD to fingolimod at six months, but this effect was not found compared to placebo at 24 months. All studies were sponsored by Novartis Pharma. Authors' conclusions Treatment with fingolimod compared to placebo in RRMS patients is effective in reducing inflammatory disease activity, but it may lead to little or no difference in preventing disability worsening. The risk of withdrawals due to adverse events requires careful monitoring of patients over time. The evidence on the risk/benefit profile of fingolimod compared with intramuscular interferon beta‐1a was uncertain, based on a low number of head‐to‐head RCTs with short follow‐up duration. The ongoing trial results will possibly satisfy these issues.","Fingolimod for relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis Background Considering the autoimmune pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), most of the treatments have been based on the immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive properties of drugs such as interferons, glatiramer, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone. Fingolimod, was the first agent to gain approval as an oral treatment in 2010. It is efficiently absorbed, its absorption is unaffected by dietary intake and, as an oral therapy, it has aroused great interest in patients, having a more acceptable route of administration than injections. Aim of the review To assess the safety and the benefits of fingolimod in reducing disease activity in people with relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS). A number of safety concerns have already emerged, including serious infections and adverse cardiac effects. Study characteristics Six studies, published between 2006 and 2014, were included in this review, comprising a total of 5152 participants suffering from RRMS. The treatment duration was six months in three studies, 12 months in one study, and 24 months in two studies. Key results and quality of evidence The main conclusion of this review was that fingolimod, administered as monotherapy at the approved dose of 0.5 mg once‐daily increases the probability of being relapse‐free at 24 months compared to placebo. The benefit was confirmed with disease activity measures defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, there was no effect on preventing disability worsening; treatment was not associated with an increased risk of patient withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparing the same dose of fingolimod to intramuscular interferon beta‐1a, the drug at one year slightly increased the number of participants free from relapse or from inflammatory enhancing lesions and decreased the relapse rate. Again, we did not detect any advantage for preventing disability progression. We found a greater likelihood of discontinuation due to adverse events in the short‐term (six months) for fingolimod as compared to immunomodulating drugs, and no significant difference compared to interferon beta at 12 months. The duration of all studies was equal or inferior to 24 months, so that the efficacy (but mostly the safety) of fingolimod over 24 months remains uncertain. This is a key point for a lifetime disease with the probability of chronic treatments as in MS. The risk of adverse events requires careful monitoring of patients over time and suggests the need for studies with longer follow‐up, particularly considering the recent warning on the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The six studies included in this review were sponsored by Novartis Pharma, and most co‐authors of the published papers were affiliated to the pharmaceutical company; this is recognised as a potential source of bias.",CD009371
"Background Primary dysmenorrhoea is the most common form of period pain and affects up to three‐quarters of women at some stage of their reproductive life. Primary dysmenorrhoea is pain in the absence of any organic cause and is characterised by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, starting within the first eight to 72 hours of menstruation.This review examines the currently available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture (stimulation of points on the body using needles) and acupressure (stimulation of points on the body using pressure) to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture and acupressure in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea when compared with a placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatment. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (to September 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Chinese databases including Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database and registers of ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or placebo control, usual care, pharmacological treatment or no treatment. We included the following modes of treatment: acupuncture, electro‐acupuncture, and acupressure. Participants were women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea during the majority of the menstrual cycles or for three consecutive menstrual cycles, and moderate to severe symptoms. Data collection and analysis We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We pooled the data where appropriate. Our primary outcomes was pain. Secondary outcomes included menstrual symptoms, quality of life, and adverse effects. Main results We included 42 RCTs (4640 women). Acupuncture or acupressure was compared with a sham/placebo group, medication, no treatment or other treatment. Many of the continuous data were not suitable for calculation of means, mainly due to evidence of skew. 1. Acupuncture studies Acupuncture versus sham or placebo control (6 RCTs) Findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. However, the only study in the review that was at low risk of bias in all domains found no evidence of a difference between the groups at three, six or 12 months. The overall quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported adverse events. Acupuncture versus NSAIDs Seven studies reported visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, but were unsuitable for pooling due to extreme heterogeneity (I² = 94%). In all studies the scores were lower in the acupuncture group, with the mean difference varying across studies from 0.64 to 4 points on a VAS 0 ‐ 10 scale (low‐quality evidence). Four RCTs reported rates of pain relief, and found a benefit for the acupuncture group (OR 4.99, 95% CI 2.82 to 8.82, 352 women, I² = 0%, low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were less common in the acupuncture group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.44, 4 RCTs, 239 women, 4 trials, I² = 15%, low‐quality evidence). Acupuncture versus no treatment Data were unsuitable for analysis, but pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group in all six studies reporting this outcome. The quality of the evidence was low. No studies reported adverse events. 2. Acupressure studies No studies of acupressure reported adverse events. Acupressure versus sham or placebo control Data were unsuitable for pooling, but two studies reported a mean benefit of one to three points on a 0 ‐ 10 VAS pain scale. Another four studies reported data unsuitable for analysis: all found that pain scores were lower in the acupuncture group. No studies reported adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low. Acupressure versus NSAIDs One study reported this outcome, using a 0 ‐ 3 pain scale. The score was higher (indicating more pain) in the acupressure group (MD 0.39 points, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57, 136 women, very low‐quality evidence). Acupressure versus no treatment There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups on a VAS 0 ‐ 10 pain scale (MD ‐0.96 points, 95% CI ‐2.54 to 0.62, 2 trials, 140 women, I² = 83%, very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture or acupressure are effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea, and for most comparisons no data were available on adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations were risk of bias, poor reporting, inconsistency and risk of publication bias.","Acupuncture for period pain Review question Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effect of acupuncture and acupressure versus a control to reduce menstrual pain and symptoms in all women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea. Primary dysmenorrhoea is defined as pain without any underlying cause. Background Dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain, is commonly experienced by younger women. Symptoms may include cramping pain in the lower abdomen that may spread to the lower back or front thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue, anxiety, and dizziness. Use of conventional treatments is high, but 20% to 25% of women still have inadequate pain relief. We therefore need other approaches to effectively manage symptoms of period pain. Acupuncture (the stimulation of points on the body using needles) and acupressure (stimulation of points on the body using pressure) are used to treat period pain, although we do not know how effective it is in reducing such pain. Study characteristics We have included 42 trials of acupuncture and acupressure compared to a control (sham/placebo, medication, Chinese herbs, no treatment or usual care) in a total of 4640 women of reproductive age with period pain. Twenty‐two studies were undertaken in China. Eight studies were undertaken in Iran, four studies in Taiwan, two studies in Korea, and one each in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA.The evidence is current to September 2015. Key results There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture or acupressure is effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea, and for most comparisons no information was available on adverse events. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations were risk of bias, poor reporting, inconsistency and risk of publication bias.",CD007854
"Background Approximately one‐fifth of all subfertile couples seeking fertility treatment show clinically relevant levels of anxiety, depression, or distress. Psychological and educational interventions are frequently offered to subfertile couples, but their effectiveness, both in improving mental health and pregnancy rates, is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for subfertile couples on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes. Search methods We searched (from inception to 2 April 2015) the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 2, 2015), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, DARE, Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed, and ongoing trials registers. We handsearched reference lists and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised trials, and cross‐over trials (first phase) evaluating the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes in subfertile couples. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Our primary outcomes were psychological measures (anxiety and depression) and fertility rates (live birth or ongoing pregnancy). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. As we did not consider the included studies to be sufficiently similar to permit meaningful pooling, we summarised the results of the individual studies by presenting the median and interquartile range (IQR) of effects as well as the minimum and maximum values. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We included 39 studies involving 4925 participants undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to a number of factors, including nature and duration of interventions, participants, and comparator groups. As a result, we judged that pooling results would not result in a clinically meaningful estimate of a treatment effect. There were substantial methodological weaknesses in the studies, all of which were judged to be at high risk of bias for one or more quality assessment domains. There was concern about attrition bias (24 studies), performance bias for psychological outcomes (27 studies) and fertility outcomes (18 studies), and detection bias for psychological outcomes (26 studies). We therefore considered study‐specific estimates of intervention effects to be unreliable. Thirty‐three studies reported the outcome mental health. Only two studies reported the outcome live birth, and both of these had substantial attrition. One study reported ongoing pregnancy, again with substantial attrition. We have combined live birth and ongoing pregnancy in one outcome. Psychological outcomes Studies utilised a variety of measures of anxiety and depression. In all cases a low score denoted benefit from the intervention. SMDs for anxiety were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = ‐0.30 (‐0.84 to 0.00), minimum value ‐5.13; maximum value 0.84, 17 RCTs, 2042 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = 0.03, minimum value ‐0.38; maximum value 0.23, 4 RCTs, 330 participants. SMDs for depression were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = ‐0.45 (‐0.68 to ‐0.08), minimum value ‐3.01; maximum value 1.23, 12 RCTs, 1160 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = ‐0.33, minimum value ‐0.46; maximum value 0.17, 3 RCTs, 304 participants. Fertility outcomes When psychological interventions were compared with attentional control or usual care, ORs for live birth or ongoing pregnancy ranged from minimum value 1.13 to maximum value 10.05. No studies of educational interventions reported this outcome. Authors' conclusions The effects of psychological and educational interventions on mental health including distress, and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Existing trials of psychological and educational interventions for subfertility were generally poorly designed and executed, resulting in very serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency in study findings. There is a need for studies employing appropriate methodological techniques to investigate the benefits of these treatments for this population. In particular, attentional control groups should be employed, that is groups receiving a treatment that mimics the amount of time and attention received by the treatment group but is not thought to have a specific effect upon the participants, in order to distinguish between therapeutic and non‐specific effects of interventions. Where attrition cannot be minimised, appropriate statistical techniques for handling drop‐out must be applied. Failure to address these issues in study design has resulted in studies that do not provide a valid basis for answering questions about the effectiveness of these interventions.","Psychological and educational interventions for subfertile men and women Background:  Approximately one‐fifth of all subfertile couples seeking fertility treatment show clinically relevant levels of anxiety, depression, or distress. Psychological and educational interventions are frequently offered to subfertile couples, but their effectiveness, both in improving mental health and pregnancy rates, is unclear.    Objective:  To assess the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for subfertile couples on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes.    Study characteristics:  We included 39 studies involving 4925 participants undergoing assisted reproductive technology.

There was concern about bias because of differences in care and amount of attention given to participants for psychological outcomes (27 studies) and fertility outcomes (18 studies), the amount of withdrawal (24 studies), and the manner in which outcome measurements were taken (26 studies). We therefore considered the results from each study to be unreliable. Thirty‐three studies reported the outcome mental health.

"Background Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta‐1 selective blockers is not known. Objectives To quantify the dose‐related effects of various doses and types of beta‐1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension. Search methods We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015). The Hypertension Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in  Appendix 1 . Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled parallel or cross‐over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol. Data collection and analysis Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data. Main results We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta‐1 selective blockers (beta‐1 blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross‐over studies, examining eight beta‐1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta‐1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta‐1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of ‐10/‐8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta‐1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta‐1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose‐response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range. Most beta‐1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose‐response of beta‐1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta‐1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses. Individually and overall beta‐1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which distinguishes them from other classes of drugs. Authors' conclusions This review provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta‐1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of ‐10/‐8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta‐1 blockers at peak hours, ‐12/‐9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, ‐8/‐7 mmHg. Beta‐1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta‐blockers and partial agonist beta‐blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta‐blockers. Beta‐1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta‐1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.","Beta‐1 selective blockers for treatment of high blood pressure Background Beta‐1 selective blockers are a subclass of beta blockers that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Drugs in this class include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nebivolol (Bystolic) and bisoprolol (Zebeta, Monocor). We developed a comprehensive methodology to examine how different doses and drugs in this class of drugs lower blood pressure. Characteristics of included studies We found and included 56 clinical trials examining the blood pressure lowering effect of eight beta‐1 blockers in 7812 people with high blood pressure. These participants were randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of beta‐1 blocker treatment or placebo for 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Key results On average, beta‐1 blockers lowered BP by ‐10 points of systolic and ‐8 points of diastolic pressure in people with mild to moderate high blood pressure. In general, higher doses of beta‐1 blockers did not show greater reduction of blood pressure compared to lower doses. The maximum blood pressure reduction was exhibited at twice the recommended starting dose. Higher doses of beta‐1 blockers lowered heart rate more than the lower doses, therefore are more likely to cause the common side effect of slowed heart rate. Beta‐1 selective blockers lower systolic and diastolic BP to a similar degree, as is the case for the other subclasses of beta blockers, and thus have little or no effect on pulse pressure. This is different from other classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was judged to be low due to various types of bias that could exaggerate the effect. A low quality of evidence means future research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.",CD007451
"Background Women with suspected early‐stage ovarian cancer need surgical staging which involves taking samples from areas within the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal lymph nodes in order to inform further treatment. One potential strategy is to surgically stage all women with suspicious ovarian masses, without any histological information during surgery. This avoids incomplete staging, but puts more women at risk of potential surgical over‐treatment. A second strategy is to perform a two‐stage procedure to remove the pelvic mass and subject it to paraffin sectioning, which involves formal tissue fixing with formalin and paraffin embedding, prior to ultrathin sectioning and multiple site sampling of the tumour. Surgeons may then base further surgical staging on this histology, reducing the rate of over‐treatment, but conferring additional surgical and anaesthetic morbidity. A third strategy is to perform a rapid histological analysis on the ovarian mass during surgery, known as 'frozen section'. Tissues are snap frozen to allow fine tissue sections to be cut and basic histochemical staining to be performed. Surgeons can perform or avoid the full surgical staging procedure depending on the results. However, this is a relatively crude test compared to paraffin sections, which take many hours to perform. With frozen section there is therefore a risk of misdiagnosing malignancy and understaging women subsequently found to have a presumed early‐stage malignancy (false negative), or overstaging women without a malignancy (false positive). Therefore it is important to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of adding frozen section to the clinical decision‐making process. Objectives To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of frozen section (index test) to diagnose histopathological ovarian cancer in women with suspicious pelvic masses as verified by paraffin section (reference standard). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015) and relevant Cochrane registers. Selection criteria Studies that used frozen section for intraoperative diagnosis of ovarian masses suspicious of malignancy, provided there was sufficient data to construct 2 x 2 tables. We excluded articles without an available English translation. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS‐2) domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing. Data extraction converted 3 x 3 tables of per patient results presented in articles into 2 x 2 tables, for two index test thresholds. Main results All studies were retrospective, and the majority reported consecutive sampling of cases. Sensitivity and specificity results were available from 38 studies involving 11,181 participants (3200 with invasive cancer, 1055 with borderline tumours and 6926 with benign tumours, determined by paraffin section as the reference standard). The median prevalence of malignancy was 29% (interquartile range (IQR) 23% to 36%, range 11% to 63%). We assessed test performance using two thresholds for the frozen section test. Firstly, we used a test threshold for frozen sections, defining positive test results as invasive cancer and negative test results as borderline and benign tumours. The average sensitivity was 90.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87.6% to 92.0%; with most studies typically reporting range of 71% to 100%), and average specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 99.2% to 99.7%; range 96% to 100%). Similarly, we analysed sensitivity and specificity using a second threshold for frozen section, where both invasive cancer and borderline tumours were considered test positive and benign cases were classified as negative. Average sensitivity was 96.5% (95% CI 95.5% to 97.3%; typical range 83% to 100%), and average specificity was 89.5% (95% CI 86.6% to 91.9%; typical range 58% to 99%). Results were available from the same 38 studies, including the subset of 3953 participants with a frozen section result of either borderline or invasive cancer, based on final diagnosis of malignancy. Studies with small numbers of disease‐negative cases (borderline cases) had more variation in estimates of specificity. Average sensitivity was 94.0% (95% CI 92.0% to 95.5%; range 73% to 100%), and average specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 92.4% to 97.8%; typical range 81% to 100%). Our additional analyses showed that, if the frozen section showed a benign or invasive cancer, the final diagnosis would remain the same in, on average, 94% and 99% of cases, respectively. In cases where the frozen section diagnosis was a borderline tumour, on average 21% of the final diagnoses would turn out to be invasive cancer. In three studies, the same pathologist interpreted the index and reference standard tests, potentially causing bias. No studies reported blinding pathologists to index test results when reporting paraffin sections. In heterogeneity analyses, there were no statistically significant differences between studies with pathologists of different levels of expertise. Authors' conclusions In a hypothetical population of 1000 patients (290 with cancer and 80 with a borderline tumour), if a frozen section positive test result for invasive cancer alone was used to diagnose cancer, on average 261 women would have a correct diagnosis of a cancer, and 706 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer. However, 4 women would be incorrectly diagnosed with a cancer (false positive), and 29 with a cancer would be missed (false negative). If a frozen section result of either an invasive cancer or a borderline tumour was used as a positive test to diagnose cancer, on average 280 women would be correctly diagnosed with a cancer and 635 would be correctly diagnosed without. However, 75 women would be incorrectly diagnosed with a cancer and 10 women with a cancer would be missed. The largest discordance is within the reporting of frozen section borderline tumours. Investigation into factors leading to discordance within centres and standardisation of criteria for reporting borderline tumours may help improve accuracy. Some centres may choose to perform surgical staging in women with frozen section diagnosis of a borderline ovarian tumour to reduce the number of false positives. In their interpretation of this review, readers should evaluate results from studies most typical of their population of patients.","Is a 'quick diagnosis' test on an ovarian mass during surgery accurate? The issue When women go to their doctor with a mass that could be ovarian cancer, they are normally referred for surgery, since the mass may need to be removed and examined microscopically in a laboratory in a procedure known as paraffin section histopathology. A third of women with ovarian cancer present with a cyst or mass without any visible evidence of spread elsewhere. However, in these apparently early‐stage cancers (confined to the ovary) surgical staging is required to decide if chemotherapy is required. This staging consists of sampling tissues within the abdomen, including lymph nodes. Different staging strategies exist. One is to perform surgical staging for all women who might have a cancer, to get information about spread. This may result in complications due to additional surgical procedures that may turn out to be unnecessary in approximately two thirds of women. A second strategy is to perform an operation to remove just the suspicious mass and await the paraffin section diagnosis. This may result in needing a further operation in one third of women if cancer is confirmed, putting them at increased risks from another operation. A third strategy is to send the mass to the laboratory during the operation for a quick diagnosis, known as 'frozen section'. This helps the surgeon decide if further surgical treatment is required during a single operation. Why is this review important? Frozen section is not as accurate as the traditional slower paraffin section examination, and it entails a risk of incorrect diagnosis, meaning that some women may not have all the samples taken at the initial surgery and may need to undergo a second operation; and others may undergo unnecessary surgical sampling. How was this review conducted? We searched all available studies reporting use of frozen section in women with suspicious ovarian masses. We excluded studies without an English translation and studies without enough information to allow us to analyse the data. What are the findings? We included 38 studies (11,181 women), reporting three types of diagnoses from the frozen section test. 1. Cancer, which occurred in an average of 29% of women. 2. Borderline tumour, which occurred in 8% of women. 3. Benign mass. In a hypothetical group of 1000 patients where 290 have cancer and 80 have a borderline tumour, 261 women would receive a correct diagnosis of a cancer and 706 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer based on a frozen section result. However, 4 women would be incorrectly diagnosed as having a cancer where none existed (false positive), and 29 women with cancer would be missed and potentially need further treatment (false negative). If surgeons used a frozen section result of either a cancer or a borderline tumour to diagnose cancer, 280 women would be correctly diagnosed with a cancer and 635 women would be correctly diagnosed without a cancer. However, 75 women would be incorrectly diagnosed as having a cancer, and 10 women with cancer would be missed on the initial test and found to have a cancer after surgery. If the frozen section result reported the mass as benign or malignant, the final diagnosis would remain the same in, on average, 94% and 99% of the cases, respectively. In cases where the frozen section diagnosis was a borderline tumour, there is a chance that the final diagnosis would turn out to be a cancer in, on average, 21% of women. What does this mean? Where the frozen section diagnosis is a borderline tumour, the diagnosis is less accurate than for benign or malignant tumours. Surgeons may choose to perform additional surgery in this group of women at the time of their initial surgery in order to reduce the need for a second operation if the final diagnosis turns out to be a cancer, as it would on average in one out of five of these women.",CD010360
"Background Calcium channel blockers are the most commonly prescribed drugs for people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is a common condition characterised by an exaggerated vasospastic response to cold or emotion: classically the digits (fingers and toes) turn white, then blue, then red. This is an update of the review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of different calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon as determined by attack rates, severity scores, participant‐preference scores and physiological measurements. Search methods For this update the Cochrane Vascular Trial Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2016) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12). In addition the TSC searched clinical trials databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of oral calcium channel blockers for the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and their quality, and extracted the data. Data extraction included adverse events. We contacted trial authors for missing data. Main results We included seven randomised trials with 296 participants. Four trials examined nifedipine and the remainder nicardipine. Comparisons were with placebo in six trials and with both dazoxiben and placebo in one trial (only the nifedipine versus placebo data were used within this review). Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon at decreasing the frequency of attacks (standardised mean difference of 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.38, P = 0.003). This translates to 1.72 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.84) fewer attacks per week on calcium channel blockers compared to placebo. One trial provided details on duration of attacks reporting no statistically significant difference between the nicardipine and placebo groups (no P value reported). Only two trials provided any detail of statistical comparisons of (unvalidated) severity scores between treatment groups: one of these trials (60 participants) reported a mean severity score of 1.55 on placebo and 1.36 on nicardipine, difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4, no P value reported) and the other trial (three participants only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) reported a median severity score of 2 on both nicardipine and placebo treatment (P > 0.999) suggesting little effect on severity. Participant‐preference scores were included in four trials, but in only two were results specific to participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and scoring systems differed between trials: scores differed between treatments in only one trial, in which 33% of participants on placebo and 73% on nifedipine reported improvement in symptoms (P < 0.001). Physiological measurements were included as outcome measures in five trials (different methodologies were used in each): none of these trials found any statistically significant between‐treatment group differences. Treatment with calcium channel blockers appeared to be associated with a number of adverse reactions, including headaches, flushing and oedema (swelling). Overall, the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; and the quality of the evidence presented was moderate for number of attacks, very low for duration of attacks, high for severity scores and low for patient preference scores. Authors' conclusions The randomised controlled trials included in this review provide moderate quality evidence that oral calcium channel blockers are minimally effective in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon as measured by the frequency of attacks and high‐quality evidence that they have little effect on severity. We are unable to comment on duration of attacks or on patient preference due to the very low and low quality of evidence as a result of small sample sizes in the included studies and the variable data quality of outcome measures.","Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon Background Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder whereby blood vessels in the fingers and toes constrict and reduce blood flow, causing pain and discolouration. This is usually in response to cold exposure or emotional stress. In a small number of cases, Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with an underlying disease but, for most people, it is idiopathic (of uncertain cause, or 'primary'). Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is extremely common (especially in women), with one UK study suggesting that over 15% of the population are affected. For people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon who do not respond to conservative measures (e.g. keeping warm), calcium channel blockers represent the first line in drug treatment. Calcium channel blockers (sometimes called calcium antagonists) are drugs that affect the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells and they are the most commonly prescribed medication for primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Study characteristics and key results This review examined seven randomised trials which included 296 participants. Although overall all the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias, the sample size of the included trials was small and there was unclear reporting of outcomes. Two different calcium channel blockers were included: nifedipine and nicardipine. Comparisons in six trials were with placebo and in one trial with both placebo and another type of drug (although only data relating to the calcium channel blocker and placebo were used in this case). Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was found to be minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon, reducing the frequency of attacks by around 1.7 attacks per person per week. One trial provided information on duration of attacks reporting no difference between the calcium channel blocker and placebo groups . Oral calcium channel blockers had no effect on severity scores in the two trials in which these were assessed. Only two trials reported preference scores (whereby participants are asked which treatment they prefer) specifically in those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and in only one of these was there a between‐treatment group difference (participants preferred nifedipine to placebo). Physiological measurements (for example measurement of finger blood flow) were performed in five trials, data could not be combined as the methods were too different, no differences found between calcium channel blocker and placebo treatment were seen in any trial. Treatment with calcium channel blockers was associated with a number of adverse events including headaches, flushing and ankle swelling. Quality of the evidence The results of this review were limited by the low number of participants recruited to the studies and by the limitations of currently used outcome measures. This review shows moderate quality evidence that oral calcium channel blockers are minimally effective in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon, as measured by the frequency of attacks, and high quality evidence that they have little effect on severity. We are unable to comment on duration of attacks and patient preference due to the very low and low quality of evidence provided by the trials in relation to these outcomes .",CD002069
"Background Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition that usually manifests in response to trauma or surgery. When it occurs, it is associated with significant pain and disability. It is thought to arise and persist as a consequence of a maladaptive pro‐inflammatory response and disturbances in sympathetically‐mediated vasomotor control, together with maladaptive peripheral and central neuronal plasticity. CRPS can be classified into two types: type I (CRPS I) in which a specific nerve lesion has not been identified, and type II (CRPS II) where there is an identifiable nerve lesion. Guidelines recommend the inclusion of a variety of physiotherapy interventions as part of the multimodal treatment of people with CRPS, although their effectiveness is not known. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for treating the pain and disability associated with CRPS types I and II. Search methods We searched the following databases from inception up to 12 February 2015: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, PEDro, Web of Science, DARE and Health Technology Assessments, without language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapy interventions for treating pain and disability in people CRPS. We also searched additional online sources for unpublished trials and trials in progress. Selection criteria We included RCTs of physiotherapy interventions (including manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, electrotherapy, physiotherapist‐administered education and cortically directed sensory‐motor rehabilitation strategies) employed in either a stand‐alone fashion or in combination, compared with placebo, no treatment, another intervention or usual care, or of varying physiotherapy interventions compared with each other in adults with CRPS I and II. Our primary outcomes of interest were patient‐centred outcomes of pain intensity and functional disability. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently evaluated those studies identified through the electronic searches for eligibility and subsequently extracted all relevant data from the included RCTs. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments and rated the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results We included 18 RCTs (739 participants) that tested the effectiveness of a broad range of physiotherapy‐based interventions. Overall, there was a paucity of high quality evidence concerning physiotherapy treatment for pain and disability in people with CRPS I. Most included trials were at 'high' risk of bias (15 trials) and the remainder were at 'unclear' risk of bias (three trials). The quality of the evidence was very low or low for all comparisons, according to the GRADE approach. We found very low quality evidence that graded motor imagery (GMI; two trials, 49 participants) may be useful for improving pain (0 to 100 VAS) (mean difference (MD) −21.00, 95% CI −31.17 to −10.83) and functional disability (11‐point numerical rating scale) (MD 2.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.48), at long‐term (six months) follow‐up, in people with CRPS I compared to usual care plus physiotherapy; very low quality evidence that multimodal physiotherapy (one trial, 135 participants) may be useful for improving 'impairment' at long‐term (12 month) follow‐up compared to a minimal 'social work' intervention; and very low quality evidence that mirror therapy (two trials, 72 participants) provides clinically meaningful improvements in pain (0 to 10 VAS) (MD 3.4, 95% CI −4.71 to −2.09) and function (0 to 5 functional ability subscale of the Wolf Motor Function Test) (MD −2.3, 95% CI −2.88 to −1.72) at long‐term (six month) follow‐up in people with CRPS I post stroke compared to placebo (covered mirror). There was low to very low quality evidence that tactile discrimination training, stellate ganglion block via ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy compared to placebo, and manual lymphatic drainage combined with and compared to either anti‐inflammatories and physical therapy or exercise are not effective for treating pain in the short‐term in people with CRPS I. Laser therapy may provide small clinically insignificant, short‐term, improvements in pain compared to interferential current therapy in people with CRPS I. Adverse events were only rarely reported in the included trials. No trials including participants with CRPS II met the inclusion criteria of this review. Authors' conclusions The best available data show that GMI and mirror therapy may provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function in people with CRPS I although the quality of the supporting evidence is very low. Evidence of the effectiveness of multimodal physiotherapy, electrotherapy and manual lymphatic drainage for treating people with CRPS types I and II is generally absent or unclear. Large scale, high quality RCTs are required to test the effectiveness of physiotherapy‐based interventions for treating pain and disability of people with CRPS I and II. Implications for clinical practice and future research are considered.","Physiotherapy for pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II Background Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition. Most commonly it affects a person's arm and hand or leg and foot and may occur after a traumatic injury. There are two types of CRPS: CRPS I in which there is no nerve injury, and CRPS II in which there is a nerve injury. Guidelines recommend physiotherapy, which could include different kinds of exercise therapy or electrotherapy for instance, along with other medical treatments for treating the pain and disability associated with CRPS. However, we do not know how well these treatments work. Review question Which types of physiotherapy treatment are effective for reducing the pain and disability associated with CRPS in adults? Study characteristics We searched for clinical trials of physiotherapy up to 12 February 2015. We included 18 trials that had 739 participants with CRPS I. In most of these trials the participants had CRPS I of the arm and hand. We did not find any clinical trials that included participants with CRPS II. Key results Overall we did not find any good quality clinical trials of physiotherapy aimed at reducing the pain and disability of CRPS I in adults. Most included trials were not well designed and contained only small numbers of patients. We did find some low quality trials suggesting that two broadly similar types of rehabilitation training, known as 'graded motor imagery' (GMI) and 'mirror therapy', might be useful for reducing the pain and disability associated with CRPS I after traumatic events or surgery or a stroke. From the limited evidence available it appears that some types of electrotherapy, such as ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, as well as a type of massage therapy known as manual lymphatic drainage, are not effective. Most studies did not report on adverse events and so we do not know if these treatments have any harmful side‐effects. On the whole, because of the limited number and low quality of available trials for the various physiotherapy treatments, we cannot be sure if any of the physiotherapy treatments we evaluated are effective for treating the pain and disability of CRPS I in adults. It is possible that some treatments, such as GMI or mirror therapy, might be effective. Further high quality clinical trials of physiotherapy are needed in order to find out if any of the different types of physiotherapy treatment are effective at improving pain and disability in people with CRPS.",CD010853
"Background Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders. Sickle cell crises in which irregular and dehydrated cells contribute to blocking of blood vessels are characterised by episodes of pain. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic.  In vitro  studies with piracetam indicate that it has the potential for inhibition and a reversal of the process of sickling of erythrocytes. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered piracetam to placebo or standard care in people, of all ages and both sexes, with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data were collected from the trials. Main results Three trials involving 169 participants were included in the review. A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary and some of the secondary outcomes were provided, but data were incomplete and based on un‐validated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes. One trial reported a reduction in the number of pain crises and their severity with active intervention than placebo but presented no data to confirm these results. A second trial presented a monthly global pain score based on the number of sickle cell crises and severity of pain but included no separate data for these primary outcomes. Although there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87) in one trial, inconsistencies in the criteria necessary for hospitalisation during sickle crises did not permit accurate conclusions to be drawn. Two of the trials reported participant satisfaction with piracetam but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed. There were no reports of toxicity or adverse effects with piracetam other than one participant who experienced dizziness. Authors' conclusions The small number of included trials and their poor methodological quality provided insufficient reliable evidence to support the routine use of this medication for preventing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.","Piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises Review question We reviewed the evidence to assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Background Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders and affects about 250 million people (5% of the world's population). It is characterised by sickle‐shaped red blood cells which may block blood vessels. This can lead to pain and damage to the major organs such as the brain, liver and spleen. Standard care is mainly supportive and in response to symptoms. Pain is controlled with drugs for pain relief and fluids to improve fluid levels. In vitro studies with piracetam have shown that it hinders the bonding of sickle haemoglobin and the bunching together of platelets. It also makes the blood less sticky and red blood cells more flexible. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 September 2015. Key results The authors of the review identified three trials, two of which had a cross‐over design. The quality of the trials was poor. There were wide differences in the people taking part, the drug dose and the outcomes measured. Three trials are included. They provide some weak and unreliable evidence that piracetam prevents painful sickle cell crises. This lack of reliable evidence illustrates some of the doubt and lack of support for the routine use of this treatment for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. The review authors conclude that future research should aim to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether piracetam is of use. Further randomised controlled trials should be well‐designed and reported according to the 'Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)' statement. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.",CD006111
"Background There is a substantial body of evidence that prescribing for care home residents is suboptimal and requires improvement. Consequently, there is a need to identify effective interventions to optimise prescribing and resident outcomes in this context. This is an update of a previously published review ( Alldred 2013 ). Objectives The objective of the review was to determine the effect of interventions to optimise overall prescribing for older people living in care homes. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Specialised Register), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL to May 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries for relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions aimed at optimising prescribing for older people (aged 65 years or older) living in institutionalised care facilities. Studies were included if they measured one or more of the following primary outcomes: adverse drug events; hospital admissions; mortality; or secondary outcomes, quality of life (using validated instrument); medication‐related problems; medication appropriateness (using validated instrument); medicine costs. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We presented a narrative summary of results. Main results The 12 included studies involved 10,953 residents in 355 (range 1 to 85) care homes in ten countries. Nine studies were cluster‐randomised controlled trials and three studies were patient‐randomised controlled trials. The interventions evaluated were diverse and often multifaceted. Medication review was a component of ten studies. Four studies involved multidisciplinary case‐conferencing, five studies involved an educational element for health and care professionals and one study evaluated the use of clinical decision support technology. We did not combine the results in a meta‐analysis due to heterogeneity across studies. Interventions to optimise prescribing may lead to fewer days in hospital (one study out of eight; low certainty evidence), a slower decline in health‐related quality of life (one study out of two; low certainty evidence), the identification and resolution of medication‐related problems (seven studies; low certainty evidence), and may lead to improved medication appropriateness (five studies out of five studies; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether the intervention improves/reduces medicine costs (five studies; very low certainty evidence) and it may make little or no difference on adverse drug events (two studies; low certainty evidence) or mortality (six studies; low certainty evidence). The risk of bias across studies was heterogeneous. Authors' conclusions We could not draw robust conclusions from the evidence due to variability in design, interventions, outcomes and results. The interventions implemented in the studies in this review led to the identification and resolution of medication‐related problems and improvements in medication appropriateness, however evidence of a consistent effect on resident‐related outcomes was not found. There is a need for high‐quality cluster‐randomised controlled trials testing clinical decision support systems and multidisciplinary interventions that measure well‐defined, important resident‐related outcomes.","Interventions to optimise prescribing for older people in care homes Background Older people living in care homes (also called nursing homes, residential homes, skilled‐nursing facilities, assisted‐living facilities or aged‐care facilities) have many complex physical and mental health problems. Care home residents are prescribed many medicines compared to people who live in their own homes, with an average of eight medicines being common. International research has shown that these medicines are often not well managed, with some residents prescribed medicines inappropriately. This has the potential to lead to harmful side effects and a loss of benefit. For these reasons, it is important to make sure that care home residents are prescribed the right medicines at the right doses. This is an update of a previously published review ( Alldred 2013 ). Study characteristics We found 12 studies involving 10,953 residents in 355 care homes in ten countries that evaluated interventions to optimise prescribing for care home residents. Most of the interventions had several components, often involving a review of medicines with a pharmacist and doctor. Some interventions included a teaching component and one study used Information Technology (IT). Key results We found no evidence of benefit of the interventions with respect to reducing adverse drug events (harmful effects caused by medicines) or death. One study led to residents having fewer days in hospital; however, the majority of studies did not show a benefit in relation to reducing hospital admissions. One study led to a slower decline in health‐related quality of life. Problems relating to medicines were found and addressed through the interventions used in the studies. Prescribing was improved based on criteria used to assess the appropriateness of prescribing in five studies. Certainty of the evidence We judged the overall quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes to be low for adverse drug events (harmful effects caused by medicines), hospital admissions, death, quality‐of‐life, medication‐related problems, medication appropriateness, and very low for the cost of medicines. More high‐quality studies need to be done to gather more evidence for these and other types of interventions. Further studies are needed to evaluate new technologies, including computer systems that support prescribing decisions. More work needs to be done to make sure that researchers are consistently measuring outcomes that are important to care home residents.",CD009095
"Background Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynaecological cancer worldwide, with an age‐standardised incidence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 women. Standard therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) includes a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum‐based chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery aims to remove as much of the visible tumour as possible. As extensive intraperitoneal metastases are typical of advanced EOC, cytoreductive surgery is usually an extensive procedure with the risk of excessive bleeding. Tranexamic acid given perioperatively is effective in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical settings. Therefore, tranexamic acid seems to be a promising agent for minimising blood loss and the need for blood transfusion among women with advanced EOC undergoing cytoreductive surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss associated with cytoreductive surgery in women with advanced EOC (stage III to IV). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro‐oncology and Orphan Cancers Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to May 2015. We also checked registers of clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tranexamic acid given during surgery versus placebo or no treatment, in adult women diagnosed with advanced EOC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (CK, AS) independently selected potentially relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This was a randomised double blind, placebo‐controlled multicentre study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of intravenous tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg body weight) versus placebo, given immediately before surgery for reducing blood loss and the need for red blood cell transfusion. The mean total estimated blood loss was 668.34 mL and 916.93 mL for participants assigned to tranexamic acid and placebo groups, respectively. The mean difference (MD) of total estimated blood loss between the groups did not show a clinically important effect (MD − 248.59 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI) − 550.9 to 53.79; one study, 100 participants; moderate quality evidence). The mean number of transfused units of blood components was not different between the two groups (low quality evidence). There were no noted differences in the incidence of reoperation, readmission or thromboembolic events (very low quality evidence). We considered the methodology of the included study to be at low risk of selection, detection, and reporting biases. However, we were concerned about an imbalance of some baseline characteristics between the groups, and as there was no protocol for blood transfusion, the rate of blood transfusion may vary depending on the practice of each participating hospital. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss in women undergoing cytoreductive surgery for advanced EOC, as only limited data are available from a single, low quality RCT at low overall risk of bias.","Does tranexamic acid given before an operation reduce blood loss for women with advanced ovarian cancer? The issue:   Cytoreductive surgery (also called debulking) is a standard surgical procedure for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. During surgery, the aim is to remove not only the ovaries, but also the uterus, fallopian tubes, and as much of the visible tumour as possible. Blood loss during cytoreductive surgery has long been recognised as a contributor to prolonged recovery time. The aim of the review:   We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss during cytoreductive surgery in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. We searched for scientific research studies up to May 2015 and found only one randomised controlled trial ‒ considered the gold standard for study design ‒ that assessed a single dose of tranexamic acid given intravenously before the start of surgery versus a placebo in women undergoing cytoreductive surgery for clinically suspected advanced advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. What are the main findings and conclusion?   Although tranexamic acid did numerically reduce blood loss, there was no clinical benefit, as the difference in blood loss was minimal, and there was no difference in need for blood transfusion, suggesting that this level of blood loss did not make a difference to the patient's well‐being. Additionally, there was incomplete and limited evidence regarding tranexamic acid‐related adverse events, so we can say little about whether tranexamic acid is safe for women with advanced ovarian cancer. The evidence we found from a single study was therefore insufficient to support routinely giving prophylactic tranexamic acid for cytoreductive surgery. This review indicates the need for future good quality, well‐designed randomised controlled trials to provide more evidence on the effectiveness, safety and appropriate administration of tranexamic acid. Quality of evidence:   The quality of the evidence was variable; therefore the overall the strength of the evidence reported in this review is low, as it is based on only one small randomised controlled study.",CD011732
"Background Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of complex wound. They can be painful, malodorous, prone to infection and slow to heal. Standard treatment includes compression therapy and a dressing. The use of protease‐modulating treatments for venous leg ulcers is increasing. These treatments are based on some evidence that a proportion of slow to heal ulcers have elevated protease activity in the wound. Point‐of‐care tests which aim to detect elevated protease activity are now available. A 'test and treat' strategy involves testing for elevated proteases and then using protease‐modulating treatments in ulcers which show elevated protease levels. Objectives To determine the effects on venous leg ulcer healing of a 'test and treat' strategy involving detection of high levels of wound protease activity and treatment with protease‐modulating therapies, compared with alternative treatment strategies such as using the same treatment for all participants or using a different method of treatment selection. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of relevant randomised clinical trials: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library ) Issue 12, 2015); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January 2016); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations January 2016); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to January 2016); EBSCO CINAHL (1937 to January 2016). We also searched three clinical trials registers, reference lists and the websites of regulatory agencies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Published or unpublished RCTs which assessed a test and treat strategy for elevated protease activity in venous leg ulcers in adults compared with an alternative treatment strategy. The test and treat strategy needed to be the only systematic difference between the groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection; we planned that two authors would also assess risk of bias and extract data. Main results We did not identify any studies which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We identified one ongoing study; it was unclear whether this would be eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions Currently there is no randomised evidence on the impact of a test and treat policy for protease levels on outcomes in people with venous leg ulcers.","A 'test and treat' strategy for elevated wound protease activity for healing in venous leg ulcers What are venous leg ulcers? Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic wound. Compression therapy (bandages or stockings) is used to treat venous leg ulcers. Dressings which aim to protect the wound and provide an environment that will help it to heal are used underneath compression. Protease‐modulating dressings are one of several types of dressing available. Why use a test and treat strategy for venous leg ulcers? Wounds that are slower to heal are thought to have higher levels of proteases (enzymes that break down proteins). Protease‐modulating dressings are designed to lower protease activity and help wounds to heal. A test to detect high levels of protease activity has also been introduced. A 'test and treat' strategy involves testing for elevated proteases and then using protease‐modulating treatments in ulcers which show elevated protease levels. It is important to know if using both the test and the treatment together can improve healing of leg ulcers. What we found In January 2016 we searched for as many relevant studies as possible that were randomised controlled trials, and which compared a 'test and treat' strategy with another treatment in people with venous leg ulcers. We did not find any eligible randomised studies. We found one ongoing study which might be relevant but could not obtain any more information on this. Research is still needed to find out if it is helpful to test venous leg ulcers for high levels of protease activity and then treat high levels using protease‐modulating treatments. This review is part of a set of reviews investigating different aspects of using protease‐modulating treatments in people with venous leg ulcers.",CD011753
"Background Acute pain frequently occurs after surgical procedures. Nicotine has been explored as an adjunctive medication for management of postoperative pain.   Objectives To assess the effect of transdermal or intranasal nicotine administration on postoperative pain, opioid analgesic use, and opioid‐related adverse events.   Search methods We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 20 March 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 3), EMBASE (1980 to 20 March 2014), and also databases of ongoing trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com/  and  http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). We re‐ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update the review. Selection criteria We included randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of perioperative (pre‐, intra‐, or postoperative) administration of nicotine on postoperative pain, opioid use, and opioid‐related adverse events. We excluded all other studies. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility and documented reasons for exclusion. In case of disagreement, a third author decided on the inclusion or exclusion of a trial report. When additional information was needed in order to decide if a trial should be included, one of the authors contacted the corresponding author of the trial in question. Main results Nine trials (666 participants) evaluated nicotine for postoperative pain. Nicotine may reduce postoperative pain scores at 24 hours by a small amount compared with placebo (eight trials, mean difference ‐0.88 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.58 to ‐0.18; low quality evidence). The effect on pain at one hour and 12 hours postoperatively was less certain (very low quality evidence). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial and not adequately explained by stratification of trials according to type of surgical procedure, smoking status, mode of nicotine administration, timing of administration, or assessed risk of bias. Excluding one trial at high risk of bias resulted in similar findings. The effect of nicotine on postoperative opioid use was uncertain due to small number of participants in the studies. Nicotine probably increases the risk of postoperative nausea (seven trials, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50; moderate quality evidence). Three trials assessed sedation but the effect is very uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. We found no evidence that nicotine increased the risk of vomiting (seven studies, risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.09; low quality evidence). The results from one single small trial were insufficient to establish whether nicotine led to an earlier hospital discharge (very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Based on evidence of generally low quality, nicotine may reduce postoperative pain at 24 hours compared with placebo, but the effects were relatively small (less than 1 point on a 10 point pain scale) and there was substantial heterogeneity in the results of our analyses. Nicotine does not appear to reduce postoperative use of opioids or opioid‐related adverse events but probably increases the risk of nausea. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of nicotine for postoperative pain and to understand the optimal timing, dose, and method of delivery of nicotine.","Nicotine for postoperative pain Review question This Cochrane review examines whether nicotine given prior to, during, or immediately after surgery results in less pain, use of opioids, and side effects from opioids. Background study characteristics Major surgery is usually associated with significant pain. The mainstay of treatment for pain following major surgery is opioid medications (strong pain killers such as morphine). However, opioids are not always entirely effective and are associated with side effects including sleepiness (sedation), shallow breathing (respiratory depression), feeling sick (nausea), and being sick (vomiting). Co‐administered medications, like paracetamol, may help improve postoperative pain control and reduce the need for opioids. We included nine clinical trials with a total of 666 participants. We searched several databases to March 2014, to find placebo‐controlled, randomized trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups, one of which includes a pretend (placebo) group) of nicotine for postoperative pain. We also contacted study authors for additional data. Not all studies reported all of the symptoms (outcomes) listed above, so what we can say about some outcomes is limited. We re‐ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update this review. Key results Our results indicated that there is low quality evidence that nicotine use results in slightly lower postoperative pain scores 24 hours after surgery. At one hour and 12 hours postoperatively the effect was less certain. Nicotine appeared not to reduce use of opioids at 60 minutes or 24 hours, neither was there evidence that it reduced sedation or vomiting. Nicotine was associated with higher risk of nausea than placebo, and this may limit its use. There was not enough data to evaluate the effects of nicotine use on other side effects associated with opioids, including respiratory depression, or the effects of nicotine use on length of hospital stay following surgery. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low or very low quality largely because of problems with the way that the studies were designed, which could have exaggerated the results, because there was insufficient data in many of the analyses to be certain about the size of the average effect and because the results of some of the studies varied substantially.",CD009634
"Background Non‐specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition. It is reported to be a major health and socioeconomic problem associated with work absenteeism, disability and high costs for patients and society. Exercise is a modestly effective treatment for chronic LBP. However, current evidence suggests that no single form of exercise is superior to another. Among the most commonly used exercise interventions is motor control exercise (MCE). MCE intervention focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles and targets the restoration of control and co‐ordination of these muscles, progressing to more complex and functional tasks integrating the activation of deep and global trunk muscles. While there are previous systematic reviews of the effectiveness of MCE, recently published trials justify an updated systematic review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non‐specific LBP. Search methods We conducted electronic searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registers from their inception up to April 2015. We also performed citation tracking and searched the reference lists of reviews and eligible trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of MCE in patients with chronic non‐specific LBP. We included trials comparing MCE with no treatment, another treatment or that added MCE as a supplement to other interventions. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. We considered function, quality of life, return to work or recurrence as secondary outcomes. All outcomes must have been measured with a valid and reliable instrument. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors screened the search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data. A third independent review author resolved any disagreement. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Review Group expanded 12‐item criteria. We extracted mean scores, standard deviations and sample sizes from the included trials, and if this information was not provided we calculated or estimated them using methods recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook . We also contacted the authors of the trials for any missing or unclear information. We considered the following time points: short‐term (less than three months after randomisation); intermediate (at least three months but less than 12 months after randomisation); and long‐term (12 months or more after randomisation) follow‐up. We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, and by calculating the Chi 2  test and the I 2  statistic. We combined results in a meta‐analysis expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 29 trials (n = 2431) in this review. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants. We considered a total of 76.6% of the included trials to have a low risk of bias, representing 86% of all participants. There is low to high quality evidence that MCE is not clinically more effective than other exercises for all follow‐up periods and outcomes tested. When compared with minimal intervention, there is low to moderate quality evidence that MCE is effective for improving pain at short, intermediate and long‐term follow‐up with medium effect sizes (long‐term, MD –12.97; 95% CI –18.51 to –7.42). There was also a clinically important difference for the outcomes function and global impression of recovery compared with minimal intervention. There is moderate to high quality evidence that there is no clinically important difference between MCE and manual therapy for all follow‐up periods and outcomes tested. Finally, there is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is clinically more effective than exercise and electrophysical agents (EPA) for pain, disability, global impression of recovery and quality of life with medium to large effect sizes (pain at short term, MD –30.18; 95% CI –35.32 to –25.05). Minor or no adverse events were reported in the included trials. Authors' conclusions There is very low to moderate quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with a minimal intervention for chronic low back pain. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE has a clinically important effect compared with exercise plus EPA. There is moderate to high quality evidence that MCE provides similar outcomes to manual therapies and low to moderate quality evidence that it provides similar outcomes to other forms of exercises. Given the evidence that MCE is not superior to other forms of exercise, the choice of exercise for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training, costs and safety.","Motor control exercise for chronic non‐specific low‐back pain Review question To evaluate the effectiveness of motor control exercise (MCE) in patients with chronic non‐specific low back pain (LBP). Background Motor control exercise is a popular form of exercise that aims to restore co‐ordinated and efficient use of the muscles that control and support the spine. Patients are initially guided by a therapist to practise normal use of the muscles during simple tasks. As the patient's skill increases the exercises are progressed to more complex and functional tasks involving the muscles of the trunk and limbs. Search date The evidence is current to April 2015. Study characteristics In total, 2431 participants were enrolled in 29 trials. The study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 323 participants, and most of them were middle‐aged people recruited from primary or tertiary care. The duration of the treatment programmes ranged from 20 days to 12 weeks, and the number of treatment sessions ranged from one to five sessions per week. Sixteen trials compared MCE with other types of exercises, seven trials compared MCE with minimal intervention, five trials compared MCE with manual therapy, three trials compared MCE with a combination of exercise and electrophysical agents, and one trial compared MCE with telerehabilitation based on home exercises. Key results and quality of evidence MCE probably provides better improvements in pain, function and global impression of recovery than minimal intervention at all follow‐up periods. MCE may provide slightly better improvements than exercise and electrophysical agents for pain, disability, global impression of recovery and the physical component of quality of life in the short and intermediate term. There is probably little or no difference between MCE and manual therapy for all outcomes and follow‐up periods. Little or no difference is observed between MCE and other forms of exercise. Given the minimal evidence that MCE is superior to other forms of exercise, the choice of exercise for chronic LBP should probably depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist training, costs and safety.",CD012004
"Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. Objectives Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. Data collection and analysis All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I 2  = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Authors' conclusions No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in kidneys, ureters, urethra or bladder. UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections and can lead to other health problems. Probiotics (live micro‐organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host) are thought to work by preventing other infectious bacteria from climbing up the urinary tract and causing infection. We were interested in studying any form of probiotics (bacteria used to change balance of bacteria) compared with no treatment, antibiotics, hormone therapy, cranberry juice or other interventions in people at risk of UTI. To assess if probiotics were effective, we planned to measure how many people had recurrent UTIs. Study characteristics We conducted a literature search up to September 2015 and nine studies were eligible for inclusion according to our selection criteria. The nine studies reported data on 735 participants and investigated probiotics for preventing UTI: seven studies involved women or girls with recurrent UTIs, one looked at children with abnormal urinary tracts, and one investigated UTI in healthy women. Key results Generally, studies were poor quality with high risk of bias. Aside from the different populations, there were also many different species of probiotics used, different dosage forms such as vaginal and oral, and probiotics were given for varying lengths of time. All of these factors may have affected our results. Most studies did not collect information on adverse effects so we were unable to estimate any harms associated with probiotic therapies. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo and no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and patients treated with antibiotics. Quality of the evidence The currently available evidence shows no reduction in UTI using probiotics.",CD008772
"Background Evidence from systematic reviews demonstrates that multi‐disciplinary rehabilitation is effective in the stroke population, in which older adults predominate. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of rehabilitation following acquired brain injury (ABI) in younger adults has not been established, perhaps because this scenario presents different methodological challenges in research. Objectives To assess the effects of multi‐disciplinary rehabilitation following ABI in adults 16 to 65 years of age. Search methods We ran the most recent search on 14 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register,  The Cochrane Library , Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), Web of Science (ISI WOS) databases, clinical trials registers, and we screened reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multi‐disciplinary rehabilitation versus routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or trials comparing an intervention in different settings, of different intensities or of different timing of onset. Controlled clinical trials were included, provided they met pre‐defined methodological criteria. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently selected trials and rated their methodological quality. A fourth review author would have arbitrated if consensus could not be reached by discussion, but in fact, this did not occur. As in previous versions of this review, we used the method described by Van Tulder 1997 to rate the quality of trials and to perform a 'best evidence' synthesis by attributing levels of evidence on the basis of methodological quality. Risk of bias assessments were performed in parallel using standard Cochrane methodology. However, the Van Tulder system provided a more discriminative evaluation of rehabilitation trials, so we have continued to use it for our primary synthesis of evidence. We subdivided trials in terms of severity of brain injury, setting and type and timing of rehabilitation offered. Main results We identified a total of 19 studies involving 3480 people. Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system. Within the subgroup of predominantly mild brain injury, 'strong evidence' suggested that most individuals made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific interventions. For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention, and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation early after injury results in better outcomes. For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation, 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' suggested that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post‐acute rehabilitation. The context of multi‐disciplinary rehabilitation appears to influence outcomes. 'Strong evidence' supports the use of a milieu‐oriented model for patients with severe brain injury, in which comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation takes place in a therapeutic environment and involves a peer group of patients. 'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in‐patient rehabilitation and specialist multi‐disciplinary community rehabilitation may provide additional functional gains, but studies serve to highlight the particular practical and ethical restraints imposed on randomisation of severely affected individuals for whom no realistic alternatives to specialist intervention are available. Authors' conclusions Problems following ABI vary. Consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to meet the needs of patients with different problems. Patients who present acutely to hospital with mild brain injury benefit from follow‐up and appropriate information and advice. Those with moderate to severe brain injury benefit from routine follow‐up so their needs for rehabilitation can be assessed. Intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains, and earlier intervention whilst still in emergency and acute care has been supported by limited evidence. The balance between intensity and cost‐effectiveness has yet to be determined. Patients discharged from in‐patient rehabilitation benefit from access to out‐patient or community‐based services appropriate to their needs. Group‐based rehabilitation in a therapeutic milieu (where patients undergo neuropsychological rehabilitation in a therapeutic environment with a peer group of individuals facing similar challenges) represents an effective approach for patients requiring neuropsychological rehabilitation following severe brain injury. Not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. For example, trial‐based literature does not tell us which treatments work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life‐long care. In the future, such questions will need to be considered alongside practice‐based evidence gathered from large systematic longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.","Rehabilitation for adults of working age who have a brain injury Background:  Studies show that multi‐disciplinary (MD) rehabilitation is beneficial for patients with brain damage from stroke. Some MD programmes are targeted to working‐age adults who have brain injury following trauma or other causes. These patients tend to be younger than most stroke patients and may have different treatment goals, such as returning to work or parenting. Brain‐injured people can have a variety of difficulties, including problems with physical functions, communication, thought processes, behaviour or emotions. The seriousness of problems can vary from mild to severe. MD rehabilitation addresses one or more of these areas instead of focusing on a single aspect such as physical (motor) function. Review question:  The authors of this Cochrane review looked for studies of MD rehabilitation in adults, 16 to 65 years of age, with acquired brain injury (ABI) from any cause. Study characteristics:  Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were controlled trials, in which one group of people received treatment (such as MD rehabilitation) and was compared with a similar group that received a different treatment. We found 19 relevant studies, which involved a total of 3480 people. Search date:  We searched the medical literature worldwide on 14 September 2015. Review methods:  We used the Van Tulder system to rate the strength of the evidence as it distinguished better between trials of different quality than the standard GRADE system on criteria that are important in the context of rehabilitation. Key results:  For mild brain injury, information and advice were usually more appropriate than intensive rehabilitation. As a whole, studies suggest that patients with moderate to severe brain injury who received more intensive rehabilitation showed earlier improvement, and that earlier rehabilitation was better than delayed treatment. Strong evidence supports the provision of cognitive rehabilitation in a therapeutic 'milieu', that is, an environment in which patients receive predominantly group‐based rehabilitation alongside a peer group of others who are facing similar challenges. Trial‐based literature provided little evidence related to other aspects of MD rehabilitation, so the review authors recommend that additional research should be done. Rehabilitation for brain injury is such an individualised and long‐term process that research studies do not necessarily facilitate general conclusions. Quality of the evidence:  Overall the included studies were of good quality; 12 of 19 studies were judged to be of high quality according to the van Tulder scoring system. The other studies were at risk of bias because of elements of their design, for example, in one study, treatment depended on the availability of a bed in the rehabilitation unit. Bed availability is a haphazard way of allocating treatment to patients, and this makes results of the study prone to bias.",CD004170
"Background Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD. Search methods In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non‐serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel‐group trials and first period data from cross‐over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post‐cross‐over data from cross‐over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias. Main results The studies.  We included 38 parallel‐group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross‐over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys‐to‐girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high‐income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias.  All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes.  Methylphenidate may improve teacher‐rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.90 to ‐0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low‐quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of ‐9.6 points (95% CI ‐13.75 to ‐6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD‐RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD‐RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis‐adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2). Secondary outcomes.  Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non‐serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis‐adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non‐serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher‐rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low‐quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta‐analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent‐reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The results of meta‐analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher‐reported ADHD symptoms, teacher‐reported general behaviour, and parent‐reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow‐up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non‐serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non‐serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo‐like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non‐pharmacological treatments.","Benefits and harms of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effects of methylphenidate on the behaviour of children and adolescents with ADHD. Background ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated childhood psychiatric disorders. Children diagnosed with ADHD find it hard to concentrate. They are often hyperactive (fidgety, unable to sit still for long periods) and impulsive (doing things without stopping to think). ADHD can make it difficult for children to do well at school, because they find it hard to follow instructions and to concentrate. Their behavioural problems can interfere with their ability to get on well with family and friends, and they often get into more trouble than other children. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD. Study characteristics We found 185 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups), involving 12,245 children or adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the trials compared methylphenidate to a placebo – something designed to look and taste the same as methylphenidate but with no active ingredient. Most trials were small and of low quality. Treatment generally lasted an average of 75 days (range 1 to 425 days), making it impossible to assess the long‐term effects of methylphenidate. Seventy‐two of the 185 included trials (40%) were funded by industry. The evidence is current to February 2015. Key results Findings suggest that methylphenidate might improve some of the core symptoms of ADHD – reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity, and helping children to concentrate. Methylphenidate might also help to improve the general behaviour and quality of life of children with ADHD. However, we cannot be confident that the results accurately reflect the size of the benefit of methylphenidate. The evidence in this review of RCTs suggests that methylphenidate does not increase the risk of serious (life threatening) harms when used for periods of up to six months. However, taking methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non‐serious harms such as sleeping problems and decreased appetite. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. It was possible for people in the trials to know which treatment the children were taking, the reporting of the results was not complete in many trials and for some outcomes the results varied across trials. These considerations limit our confidence in the overall results of the review. Conclusions At the moment, the quality of the available evidence means that we cannot say for sure whether taking methylphenidate will improve the lives of children and adolescents with ADHD. Methylphenidiate is associated with a number of non‐serious adverse events such as problems with sleeping and decreased appetite. Although we did not find evidence that there is an increased risk of serious adverse events, we need trials with longer follow‐up to better assess the risk of serious adverse events in people who take methylphenidate over a long period of time. Given that methylphenidate is associated with adverse events, designing high quality trials is challenging. It can be easy for clinicians, researchers and participants to work out whether a child is in the experimental group (receiving methylphenidate) or in the control group (receiving the placebo). This is a serious risk of bias that can make us less confident in the results of a trial. One way to avoid this is to design trials that compare methylphenidate with a placebo that can produce similar adverse events, but which has no other active ingredient. These trials are known as 'nocebo trials'. For ethical reasons, nocebo trials should first be undertaken with adults. Only if the results suggest that methylphenidate is effective for adults, should researchers consider recruiting children to trials with this design.",CD009885
"Background The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. Data collection and analysis We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. Main results We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. Authors' conclusions The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Treatment for eyes that drift upwards Review question   The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and non‐surgical treatments for dissociated vertical deviation. Background   Eye misalignment (strabismus) is the drifting of one or both eyes, which can be inward, outward, upward, or downward. This review evaluated the treatment for a specific type of upward drifting of one or both eyes known as dissociated vertical deviation (DVD). DVD can occur in both children and adults. For some people, DVD is controlled and is only detectable during testing. In others, DVD happens all of a sudden as the eye drifts up of its accord. It can be hard for the person to gain control of the eye, which can cause distress to the person in social situations. The condition also may cause double vision or eyestrain. Surgery is the common treatment for DVD. Treatments that do not involve surgery are uncommon. There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of treatments (either surgical or non‐surgical) for DVD. Study characteristics   We conducted the search for studies on 3 August 2015. We found four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment for DVD. We found no studies evaluating non‐surgical treatments. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared a surgical repositioning procedure (anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle) with or without resection; one in the USA compared surgical weakening of an eye muscle (superior rectus recession) with or without augmentation with a fixation suture; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus removal of a piece of the inferior oblique muscle (myectomy). Key results   Only one of the RCTs examined what we wanted to know: the proportion of participants who had surgical success. There was insufficient information available to determine the differences between any of the surgical procedures with respect to surgical success or any other outcome relevant to our review. The most common adverse events from the surgical procedures were downward drifting of the eye after surgery (hypotropia), limited upward movement of the eye, and need for repeat surgery. Quality of the evidence   All four of the included studies had flaws in design, execution, or both that weaken their conclusions. There is a need for well‐designed, rigorously conducted RCTs of treatments for DVD to provide more reliable evidence for the management of this condition.",CD010868
"Background Regular antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy is accepted practice, and while most women have an increase in the number of antenatal visits, there is no consensus as to what constitutes optimal care. 'Specialised' antenatal clinics have been advocated as a way of improving outcomes for women and their infants. Objectives To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of 'specialised' antenatal clinics compared with 'standard' antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies with a multiple pregnancy who received antenatal care specifically designed for women with a multiple pregnancy (as defined by the trial authors) with outcomes in controls who received 'standard' antenatal care (as defined by the trial authors). Data collection and analysis Two of the review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Both review authors extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We graded the quality of the evidence using GRADEpro software. Main results Findings were based on the results of a single study with some design limitations. Data were available from one study involving 162 women with a multiple pregnancy. For the only reported primary outcome, perinatal mortality, we are uncertain whether specialised antenatal clinics makes any difference compared to standard care (risk ratio (RR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.03; 324 infants,  very low quality evidence ). Women receiving specialised antenatal care were significantly more likely to birth by caesarean section (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.81; 162 women,  moderate quality evidence ). Data were not reported in the study on the following primary outcomes: small‐for‐gestational age, very preterm birth or maternal death. There were no differences identified between specialised antenatal care and standard care for other secondary outcomes examined: postnatal depression (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.20; 133 women,  very low quality evidence ), breastfeeding (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.68; 123 women,  very low quality evidence ), stillbirth (RR 0.68; 0.12 to 4.04) or neonatal death (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.19 to 22.39) (324 infants). Authors' conclusions There is currently limited information available from randomised controlled trials to assess the role of 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy compared with 'standard' antenatal care in improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The value of 'specialised' multiple pregnancy clinics in improving health outcomes for women and their infants requires evaluation in appropriately powered and designed randomised controlled trials.","Specialised antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy with the aim of improving outcomes for babies and mothers What is the issue? Women carrying more than one baby (multiple pregnancy) are at increased risk of complications which can affect the health of both mother and babies. We asked if 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with multiple pregnancies would improve outcomes for these women and their babies compared with attending standard antenatal clinics. Why is this important? Babies of multiple pregnancies are more likely to be born too early (preterm birth) and to thus have problems with immature organs e.g. lungs. These babies are also less likely to survive. Women carrying more than one baby are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure, diabetes and bleeding. So it is important to see if specialised clinics during pregnancy can improve outcomes for these babies and mothers. These specialised clinics might include seeing the same midwife throughout pregnancy, having more antenatal appointments and additional information. What evidence did we find? We found one small study involving 162 women and their babies (searched date 31 May 2015). The quality of the study was very low to moderate for our outcomes. The study was too small to provide answers to our question as we were most interested in the chance of the babies being born too early, their health and whether they survived. We did find that mothers with multiple pregnancies were more likely to have a caesarean birth if they attended specialised multiple pregnancy clinics. What does this mean? There is insufficient good quality evidence to support the use of specialised clinics for women with multiple pregnancies. There is an urgent need for more good quality studies to answer this important question.

"Background Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy, particularly among women in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Traditionally, gestational anaemia has been prevented with daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy, but adherence to this regimen due to side effects, interrupted supply of the supplements, and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake, have limited the use of this intervention. Intermittent (i.e. two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) supplementation has been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2015), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 July 2015) and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies (31 July 2015). Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy. Main results This review includes 27 trials from 15 countries, but only 21 trials (with 5490 women) contributed data to the review. All studies compared daily versus intermittent iron supplementation. The methodological quality of included studies was mixed and most had high levels of attrition.The overall assessment of the quality of the evidence for primary infant outcomes was low and for maternal outcomes very low. Of the 21 trials contributing data, three studies provided intermittent iron alone, 14 intermittent iron + folic acid and four intermittent iron plus multiple vitamins and minerals in comparison with the same composition of supplements provided in a daily regimen. Overall, for women receiving  any  intermittent iron regimen (with or without other vitamins and minerals) compared with a daily regimen there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for any infant primary outcomes: low birthweight (average risk ratio (RR) 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.22; participants = 1898; studies = eight;  low quality evidence ), infant birthweight (mean difference (MD) 5.13 g; 95% CI ‐29.46 to 39.72; participants = 1939; studies = nine;  low quality evidence ), premature birth (average RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.39; participants = 1177; studies = five;  low quality evidence ), or neonatal death (average RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.04 to 5.42; participants = 795; studies = one;  very low quality ). None of the studies reported congenital anomalies. For maternal outcomes, there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anaemia at term (average RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.80; participants = 676; studies = four; I² = 10%;  very low quality ). Women receiving intermittent supplementation had fewer side effects (average RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; participants = 1777; studies = 11; I² = 87%;  very low quality ) and were at lower risk of having high haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (greater than 130 g/L) during the second or third trimester of pregnancy (average RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74; participants = 2616; studies = 15; I² = 52%; (this was not a primary outcome)) compared with women receiving daily supplements. There were no significant differences in iron‐deficiency anaemia at term between women receiving intermittent or daily iron + folic acid supplementation (average RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.08 to 6.63; participants = 156; studies = one). There were no maternal deaths (six studies) or women with severe anaemia in pregnancy (six studies). None of the studies reported on iron deficiency at term or infections during pregnancy. Most of the studies included in the review (14/21 contributing data) compared intermittent oral iron + folic acid supplementation compared with daily oral iron + folic acid supplementation (4653 women) and findings for this comparison broadly reflect findings for the main comparison (any intermittent versus any daily regimen). Three studies with 464 women examined supplementation with intermittent oral iron alone compared with daily oral iron alone. There were no clear differences between groups for mean birthweight, preterm birth, maternal anaemia or maternal side effects. Other primary outcomes were not reported. Four studies with a combined sample size of 412 women compared intermittent oral iron + vitamins and minerals supplementation with daily oral iron + vitamins and minerals supplementation. Results were not reported for any of the review's infant primary outcomes. One study reported fewer maternal side effects in the intermittent iron group, and two studies that more women were anaemic at term compared with those receiving daily supplementation. Where sufficient data were available for primary outcomes, we set up subgroups to look for possible differences between studies in terms of earlier or later supplementation; women's anaemia status at the start of supplementation; higher and lower weekly doses of iron; and the malarial status of the region in which the trials were conducted. There was no clear effect of these variables on results. Authors' conclusions This review is the most comprehensive summary of the evidence assessing the benefits and harms of intermittent iron supplementation in pregnant women on haematological and pregnancy outcomes. Findings suggest that intermittent regimens produced similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation but were associated with fewer side effects and reduced the risk of high levels of Hb in mid and late pregnancy, although the risk of mild anaemia near term was increased. While the quality of the evidence was assessed as  low  or  very low,  intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care.","Intermittent regimens of iron supplementation during pregnancy Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy, particularly among women from low‐ and middle‐income countries who have insufficient iron intake to meet increased iron needs. Traditionally, pregnancy anaemia has been prevented with the provision of daily iron supplements, however, it has recently been proposed that if women take supplements less often, such as once or twice weekly rather than daily, this might reduce side effects and increase acceptance and adherence to supplementation. In this review we assess the benefits and harms of intermittent (i.e. two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) oral supplementation with iron or iron + folic acid or iron + vitamins and minerals for pregnant women. We included 27 randomised controlled trials, but only 21 trials involving 5490 women, had information on the outcomes we evaluated. Three studies looked at intermittent iron alone versus daily iron alone, the other studies included in the review compared intermittent iron combined with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals compared with the same supplements provided daily. Looking at all the studies together (any intermittent regimen including iron versus a daily regimen), there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for most of the outcomes we examined including infant birthweight, premature birth, and perinatal death, or anaemia, haemoglobin concentration and iron deficiency in women at the end of pregnancy. However, women receiving intermittent rather than daily iron supplements were less likely to report side effects (such as constipation and nausea). In addition, intermittent supplementation appeared to decrease the number of women with high haemoglobin concentrations during mid and late pregnancy compared with daily regimens. High haemoglobin concentrations may be harmful as they may be associated with an increased risk of having a premature birth and low birthweight baby. There were no other clear differences between groups for other outcomes examined.",CD009997
"Background In many countries women are given their own case notes to carry during pregnancy to increase their sense of control over, and satisfaction with, their care. Objectives To evaluate the effects of giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of women given their own case notes to carry during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and assessed study quality. One review author extracted data from the included studies using a standard form (checked by second review author). We assessed estimates of effect using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results Four trials were included (n = 1176 women). Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as low to moderate mainly due to the nature of the intervention not allowing blinding. The updated search identified one cluster‐randomised trial, which was included. Women carrying their own notes were more likely to feel in control (two trials, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.06; 450 women;  moderate quality evidence ), although there is no evidence of difference in women's satisfaction (two trials, average RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.29); 698 women;  low quality evidence ). More women in the case notes group wanted to carry their own notes in a subsequent pregnancy (three trials, RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.03; 552 women;  low quality evidence ). Overall, the pooled estimate of the two trials (n = 347) that reported on the risk of notes lost or left at home was not significant (average RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.84). There was no evidence of difference for health‐related behaviours (cigarette smoking and breastfeeding ( moderate quality evidence )), analgesia needs during labour ( low quality evidence ), maternal depression, miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal deaths ( moderate quality evidence ). More women in the case notes group had operative deliveries (one trial, RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12; 212 women), and caesarean sections (one trial, average RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.08; 501 women;  moderate quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions The four trials are small, and not all of them reported on all outcomes. The results suggest that there are both potential benefits (increased maternal control and increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance) and harms (more operative deliveries). Importantly, all of the trials report that more women in the case notes group would prefer to carry their antenatal records in another pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence on health‐related behaviours (smoking and breastfeeding), women's satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. It is important to emphasise that this review shows a lack of evidence of benefit rather than evidence of no benefit.","Giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as low to moderate. The updated search identified one cluster‐randomised trial, which was included. Women carrying their own case notes improves their sense of control and the availability of antenatal records, but insufficient evidence of additional effects. In some healthcare systems women are given their own case notes to look after and bring to each antenatal visit. This review of four trials, involving 1176 women, suggests that there are both potential benefits (increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance, and increased maternal control) and harms (more operative deliveries). All the trials reported that more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy, but there was not enough evidence to determine the effect of women carrying their own case notes on health behaviours such as smoking and breastfeeding, women's satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.",CD002856
"Background Haemodialysis treatment requires reliable vascular access. Optimal access is provided via functional arteriovenous fistula (fistula), which compared with other forms of vascular access, provides superior long‐term patency, requires few interventions, has low thrombosis and infection rates and cost. However, it has been estimated that between 20% and 60% of fistulas never mature sufficiently to enable haemodialysis treatment. Mapping blood vessels using imaging technologies before surgery may identify vessels that are most suitable for fistula creation. Objectives We compared the effect of conducting routine radiological imaging evaluation for vascular access creation preoperatively with standard care without routine preoperative vessel imaging on fistula creation and use. Search methods We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 14 April 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) with chronic or end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) who needed fistulas (both before dialysis and after dialysis initiation) that compared fistula maturation rates relating to use of imaging technologies to map blood vessels before fistula surgery with standard care (no imaging). Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed study quality and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes, including fistula creation, maturation and need for catheters at dialysis initiation, were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes, such as numbers of interventions required to maintain patency, were expressed as mean differences (MD). We used the random‐effects model to measure mean effects. Main results Four studies enrolling 450 participants met our inclusion criteria. Overall risk of bias was judged to be low in one study, unclear in two, and high in one. There was no significant differences in the number of fistulas that were successfully created (4 studies, 433 patients: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28; I² = 76%); the number of fistulas that matured at six months (3 studies, 356 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25; I² = 0%); number of fistulas that were used successfully for dialysis (2 studies, 286 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.28; I² = 0%); the number of patients initiating dialysis with a catheter (1 study, 214 patients: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.04); and in the rate of interventions required to maintain patency (1 study, 70 patients: MD 14.70 interventions/1000 patient‐days, 95% CI ‐7.51 to 36.91) between the use of preoperative imaging technologies compared with standard care (no imaging). Authors' conclusions Based on four small studies, preoperative vessel imaging did not improve fistula outcomes compared with standard care. Adequately powered prospective studies are required to fully answer this question.","Preoperative vascular access evaluation for haemodialysis patients Vascular access is required for people on haemodialysis to connect with the dialysis machine. Compared with other types of vascular access, there is wide acceptance that arteriovenous fistulas (fistulas) provide best outcomes for patients because there is less likelihood of infection and clotting. Fistulas can take a long time to mature enough to be used for dialysis and many fail. Mapping blood vessels using medical imaging techniques before a fistula operation may help surgeons plan the best fistula location by selecting the best blood vessels to create the fistula. This may enhance the likelihood that the fistulas will mature and stay open and available for dialysis use ('patency'). For this review, we searched the literature published up to April 2015 and found four studies that involved 450 participants which met our inclusion criteria. The included studies compared the proportions of fistulas that matured when evaluation was carried out before surgery using medical imaging techniques with standard care (no imaging). Our analysis found that vessel imaging before surgery did not improve the rate of fistulas that matured. Further research in this area involving more participants may be beneficial to better understand if imaging before surgery could help to increase the success of fistulas for people who need haemodialysis.",CD007013
"Background Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with bone marrow failure. Although considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40 years, some areas continue to provoke debate, especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004 and updated in 2012 that addressed four separate questions: therapeutic‐only versus prophylactic platelet transfusion policy; prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold; prophylactic platelet transfusion dose; and platelet transfusions compared to alternative treatments. We have now split this review into four smaller reviews looking at these questions individually; this review is the first part of the original review. Objectives To determine whether a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy (platelet transfusions given when patient bleeds) is as effective and safe as a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (platelet transfusions given to prevent bleeding, usually when the platelet count falls below a given trigger level) in patients with haematological disorders undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 23 July 2015. Selection criteria RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent or treat bleeding in patients with malignant haematological disorders receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or undergoing HSCT. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We identified seven RCTs that compared therapeutic platelet transfusions to prophylactic platelet transfusions in haematology patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT. One trial is still ongoing, leaving six trials eligible with a total of 1195 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2013 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. We were able to critically appraise five of these studies, which contained separate data for each arm, and were unable to perform quantitative analysis on one study that did not report the numbers of participants in each treatment arm. Overall the quality of evidence per outcome was low to moderate according to the GRADE approach. None of the included studies were at low risk of bias in every domain, and all the studies identified had some threats to validity. We deemed only one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains other than blinding. Two RCTs (801 participants) reported at least one bleeding episode within 30 days of the start of the study. We were unable to perform a meta‐analysis due to considerable statistical heterogeneity between studies. The statistical heterogeneity seen may relate to the different methods used in studies for the assessment and grading of bleeding. The underlying patient diagnostic and treatment categories also appeared to have some effect on bleeding risk. Individually these studies showed a similar effect, that a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion strategy was associated with an increased risk of clinically significant bleeding compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy. Number of days with a clinically significant bleeding event per participant was higher in the therapeutic‐only group than in the prophylactic group (one RCT; 600 participants; mean difference 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.90; moderate‐quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in the number of participants with severe or life‐threatening bleeding between a therapeutic‐only transfusion policy and a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (two RCTs; 801 participants; risk ratio (RR) 4.91, 95% CI 0.86 to 28.12; low‐quality evidence). Two RCTs (801 participants) reported time to first bleeding episode. As there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. Both studies individually found that time to first bleeding episode was shorter in the therapeutic‐only group compared with the prophylactic platelet transfusion group. There was insufficient evidence to determine any difference in all‐cause mortality within 30 days of the start of the study using a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (two RCTs; 629 participants). Mortality was a rare event, and therefore larger studies would be needed to establish the effect of these alternative strategies. There was a clear reduction in the number of platelet transfusions per participant in the therapeutic‐only arm (two RCTs, 991 participants; standardised mean reduction of 0.50 platelet transfusions per participant, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.37; moderate‐quality evidence). None of the studies reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any difference in the frequency of adverse events, such as transfusion reactions, between a therapeutic‐only and prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (two RCTs; 991 participants; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.68), although the confidence intervals were wide. Authors' conclusions We found low‐ to moderate‐grade evidence that a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy is associated with increased risk of bleeding when compared with a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy in haematology patients who are thrombocytopenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT. There is insufficient evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates and no evidence of any difference in adverse events between a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy and a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy. A therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy is associated with a clear reduction in the number of platelet components administered.","Platelet transfusions to treat bleeding compared with platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding in people with blood cancers receiving intensive treatment Review question We evaluated the evidence regarding whether giving platelet transfusions to patients with low platelets who are bleeding (therapeutically) is as effective and safe as giving platelet transfusions regularly to prevent bleeding (prophylactically). Our target population was people with blood cancers who were receiving intensive myelosuppressive (causing decreased blood cell production) chemotherapy treatments or stem cell transplantation. Background People with blood cancers may have low platelet counts because of their underlying cancer. Blood cancers may be treated with chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, which can cause low platelet counts. Platelet transfusions may be given when the platelet count falls below a prespecified platelet count (for example 10 x 10 9 /L) to prevent bleeding, or they may be given to treat bleeding (such as a prolonged nosebleed or multiple bruises). The routine use of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding in these patients has not previously been supported by high‐quality evidence. Study characteristics The evidence is current to July 2015. In this update, we identified seven randomised controlled trials that compared only giving platelet transfusions to treat bleeding versus giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding. One trial is still recruiting participants and has not been completed. We reviewed six randomised controlled trials with a total of 1195 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2013. Five of the trials included adults who were receiving chemotherapy or a stem cell transplantation as treatment for blood cancers. One of the trials included children receiving chemotherapy for leukaemia. Four of the six studies reported funding sources; these were charitable foundations or government funds. Key results Giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding in patients with low platelet counts due to blood cancers or their treatments may result in a reduction in bleeding when compared with giving platelet transfusions only to treat bleeding. There may not be an increased risk of death or adverse events if platelet transfusions are only given to treat bleeding versus giving platelet transfusions to prevent and treat bleeding, but there was not enough evidence to be certain about this. Giving platelet transfusions only when bleeding occurs probably reduces the number of platelets given. None of the six studies reported any quality‐of‐life outcomes. Quality of the evidence The evidence for most of the findings was of low or moderate quality, as patients and their doctors knew which study arm the patient had been put in; outcomes reported in the studies were difficult to compare because bleeding was measured and reported differently; and some outcomes were imprecise, because the outcome did not happen very often (such as death).",CD010981
"Background We became aware through talking with people with asthma that some are using pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. Pulse oximeters are marketed by some suppliers as essential equipment for the home medicine cabinet. We wanted to find out if reliable evidence is available on use of pulse oximeters to self monitor asthma exacerbations at home. We decided to include only trials that used pulse oximeters as part of a personalised asthma action plan because it is important that decisions are made on the basis of symptoms as well as oxygen saturation, and that patients have a clear protocol to follow when their asthma worsens. Objectives To determine whether pulse oximeters used as part of a personalised asthma action plan for people with asthma are safer and more effective than a personalised asthma action plan alone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which includes reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and PsycINFO, and by handsearching. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Participants would have included adults, children or both with a diagnosis of asthma. We planned to include trials in which investigators compared participants who used pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen levels at home during an asthma exacerbation as part of a personalised asthma action plan (PAAP) versus those who used a PAAP without a pulse oximeter. We planned to include studies involving people receiving any treatment regimen provided that no medicine was included as part of the randomisation schedule. Data collection and analysis We planned to use standard methods as recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We found no studies and no evidence to support or refute the use of home pulse oximetry in self management of asthma; therefore, we can make no recommendations about use of a pulse oximeter as part of a PAAP. Authors' conclusions We found no reliable data to support or refute patient use of pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen saturation levels when experiencing an asthma attack. People should not use a pulse oximeter without seeking advice from a qualified healthcare professional. We identified no compelling rationale for home monitoring of oxygen levels in isolation for most people with asthma. Some people have a reduced perception of the severity of their own breathlessness when exposed to hypoxia. If trials on self monitoring of oxygen levels in the blood by pulse oximeter at home by people with asthma are conducted, the pulse oximeter must be given as part of a personalised asthma action plan.","Pulse oximeters used to self monitor oxygen saturation levels as part of a personalised asthma action plan for people with asthma We became aware through talking with people with asthma that some are using pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack.

"Background A large proportion of people with advanced cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. Tapentadol is a novel, centrally acting analgesic medicine acting at the μ‐opioid receptor and inhibiting noradrenaline reuptake. The efficacy of tapentadol is stated to be comparable to morphine and oxycodone. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol for the relief of cancer pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from January 2005 to July 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and review articles, and two clinical trial registries. Searches started from 2005 because this covered the period during which clinical trials were conducted. We contacted the manufacturer of tapentadol in the UK to find additional trials not identified by electronic searches. We did not restrict searches by language. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tapentadol compared with placebo or active controls in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain. Pain had to be measured using a validated assessment tool, and studies had to include at least 10 participants per treatment arm. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias. We extracted available data on study design, participant details, interventions, and outcomes, including analgesic outcome measures, withdrawals, and adverse events. Main results We included four studies with 1029 participants. All the studies used a parallel‐group design, and included an initial titration phase to determine the maximum effective and tolerated dose, followed by a maintenance phase. Tapentadol medication was taken twice daily and doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg per day. Rescue medication (morphine or oxycodone immediate‐release) was available to participants in all studies. Overall, 440 participants were randomised in classically designed RCTs, and 589 participants were enrolled in enriched‐enrolment, randomised‐withdrawal (EERW) trials. A total of 476 participants were randomised to titration with tapentadol and 338 participants took tapentadol throughout the maintenance phase of their trial. All studies used numerical rating scores, Patient Global Impression of Change scores, and use of rescue medication as measures of efficacy, and all reported on adverse events and withdrawals. All studies enrolled fewer than 200 participants per treatment arm and were therefore at risk of overestimating efficacy. One study was terminated early due to problems with supply of rescue medication, with fewer than 20 participants enrolled per treatment arm in the maintenance phase of the trial. We judged another study at high risk of bias due to an open‐label design. There were insufficient data for pooling and statistical analysis. Response rates for pain intensity were comparable across treatment groups in each study. In one EERW study, response rates were high across both treatment and placebo arms during the maintenance phase (62% tapentadol, 69% morphine, 50% placebo). For pain relief, tapentadol is no more and no less effective than oxycodone or morphine (low quality evidence). Treatment emergent adverse event rates were high, approximately 50% to 90%. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation) (low quality evidence). There was no advantage of tapentadol over morphine or oxycodone in terms of serious adverse events. The number of people experiencing effects on consciousness, appetite, or thirst was low. Authors' conclusions Information from RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of tapentadol was limited. The available studies were of moderate or small size and used different designs, which prevented pooling of data. Pain relief and adverse events were comparable between the tapentadol and morphine and oxycodone groups.","Oral tapentadol for cancer pain Tapentadol taken by mouth produced good pain relief for people with moderate to severe cancer pain, similar to morphine or oxycodone. One person in two or three who gets cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. As the cancer advances, the pain may get worse. Morphine has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. Since then, a number of medications with morphine‐like actions have been developed for controlling pain, one of which is tapentadol. Tapentadol has been studied in clinical trials since 2005, but has only been used in the UK since 2011. It is available in tablets of different strengths, and is normally taken twice a day. In this review, we set out to estimate how well tapentadol worked and how many people had side effects, including serious effects or those that stopped people from taking the medication. We searched medical databases for clinical trials in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain that compared tapentadol with placebo (dummy medicine) or other pain‐relieving medicines, and measured pain using recognised assessment methods. We found four studies with 1029 participants. All four studies compared participants taking tapentadol to participants taking similar medicine, such as morphine or oxycodone. All studies gave participants a period of time to find the best dose to take, before continuing on the medication and comparing their pain levels. All the studies were small or medium sized, so the results are at risk of being influenced by random fluctuations rather than real differences, and they may also overestimate any effects. One trial allowed participants to know what medication they were taking, and one trial was stopped early due administrative problems, so they did not have enough people in the study. We have to be cautious interpreting results from these studies. Because the studies all used different designs, we could not compare the results from one with another. However, each study showed that there was not much difference between the pain levels of people taking tapentadol and people taking morphine and oxycodone. Pain levels were generally well controlled. The studies also showed there was no measurable difference in how many adverse effects people had while taking tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone. Therefore, we can conclude only that the studies to date show tapentadol was no more or less effective and no more or less well tolerated than morphine and oxycodone.",CD011460
"Background Cancer patients are 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than healthy people. Therefore it is important to provide cancer patients with programmes to support the return‐to‐work (RTW) process. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing RTW in cancer patients compared to alternative programmes including usual care or no intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (January 1947 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 1983 to March, 2014), OSH‐ROM and OSH Update (January 1960 to March, 2014), PsycINFO (January 1806 to 25 March 2014), DARE (January 1995 to March, 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov, Trialregister.nl and Controlled‐trials.com up to 25 March 2014. We also examined the reference lists of included studies and selected reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of psycho‐educational, vocational, physical, medical or multidisciplinary interventions enhancing RTW in cancer patients. The primary outcome was RTW measured as either RTW rate or sick leave duration measured at 12 months' follow‐up. The secondary outcome was quality of life. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled study results we judged to be clinically homogeneous in different comparisons reporting risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using the GRADE approach. Main results Fifteen RCTs including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria and because of multiple arms studies we included 19 evaluations. We judged six studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias. All included studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients (two trials). Two studies involved psycho‐educational interventions including patient education and teaching self‐care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho‐educational interventions compared to care as usual (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35, n = 260 patients) and low quality evidence that there is no difference in the effect of psycho‐educational interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.2 to 0.3, n = 260 patients). We did not find any studies on vocational interventions. In one study breast cancer patients were offered a physical training programme. Low quality evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective than care as usual in improving RTW (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.54, n = 28 patients) or quality of life (SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.25, n = 41 patients). Seven RCTs assessed the effects of a medical intervention on RTW. In all studies a less radical or functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment. We found low quality evidence that less radical, functioning conserving approaches had similar RTW rates as more radical treatments (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09, n = 1097 patients) and moderate quality evidence of no differences in quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.23, n = 1028 patients). Five RCTs involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback‐assisted behavioral training and/or physical exercises were combined. Moderate quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho‐educational and/or vocational components led to higher RTW rates than care as usual (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16, n = 450 patients). We found no differences in the effect of multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.20 to 0.25, n = 316 patients). Authors' conclusions We found moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary interventions enhance the RTW of patients with cancer.","Interventions to enhance return‐to‐work for cancer patients Research question What is the best way to help cancer patients get back to work when compared to care as usual? Background Each year more and more people who get cancer manage to get through treatment alive. Many cancer survivors live well, although they can continue to experience long‐lasting problems such as fatigue, pain and depression. These long‐term effects can cause problems with cancer survivors' participation in working life. Therefore, cancer is a significant cause of absence from work, unemployment and early retirement. Cancer patients, their families and society at large all carry part of the burden. In this Cochrane review we evaluated how well cancer patients can be helped to return to work. Study characteristics The search date was 25 March 2014. Fifteen randomised controlled trials including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria. We found four types of interventions. In the first, psycho‐educational interventions, participants learned about physical side effects, stress and coping and they took part in group discussions. In the second type of physical intervention participants took part in exercises such as walking. In the third type of intervention, participants received medical interventions ranging from cancer drugs to surgery. The fourth kind concerned multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback‐assisted behavioral training and/or physical exercises were combined.We did not find any studies on vocational interventions aimed at work‐related issues. Key results Results suggest that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho‐educational and/or vocational components led to more cancer patients returning to work than when they received care as usual. Quality of life was similar. When studies compared psycho‐educational, physical and medical interventions with care as usual they found that similar numbers of people returned to work in all groups. Quality of the evidence We found low quality evidence of similar return‐to‐work rates for psycho‐educational interventions compared to care as usual. We also found low quality evidence showing that physical training was not more effective than care as usual in improving return‐to‐work. We also found low quality evidence that less radical cancer treatments had similar return‐to‐work rates as more radical treatments. Moderate quality evidence showed multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho‐educational and/or vocational components led to higher return‐to‐work rates than care as usual.",CD007569
"Background Ultrasonography (performed by means of a four‐quadrant, focused assessment of sonography for trauma (FAST)) is regarded as a key instrument for the initial assessment of patients with suspected blunt abdominal and thoraco‐abdominal trauma in the emergency department setting. FAST has a high specificity but low sensitivity in detecting and excluding visceral injuries. Proponents of FAST argue that ultrasound‐based clinical pathways enhance the speed of primary trauma assessment, reduce the number of unnecessary multi‐detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans, and enable quicker triage to surgical and non‐surgical care. Given the proven accuracy, increasing availability of, and indication for, MDCT among patients with blunt abdominal and multiple injuries, we aimed to compile the best available evidence of the use of FAST‐based assessment compared with other primary trauma assessment protocols. Objectives To assess the effects of diagnostic algorithms using ultrasonography including in FAST examinations in the emergency department in relation to the early, late, and overall mortality of patients with suspected blunt abdominal trauma. Search methods The most recent search was run on 30th June 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. Trial authors were contacted for further information and individual patient data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Participants were patients with blunt torso, abdominal, or multiple trauma undergoing diagnostic investigations for abdominal organ injury. The intervention was diagnostic algorithms comprising emergency ultrasonography (US). The control was diagnostic algorithms without US examinations (for example, primary computed tomography (CT) or diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)). Outcomes were mortality, use of CT or invasive procedures (DPL, laparoscopy, laparotomy), and cost‐effectiveness. Data collection and analysis Two authors (DS and CG) independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Where possible, data were pooled and relative risks (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and weighted mean differences, each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated by fixed‐effect or random‐effects models as appropriate. Main results We identified four studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Overall, trials were of poor to moderate methodological quality. Few trial authors responded to our written inquiries seeking to resolve controversial issues and to obtain individual patient data. Strong heterogeneity amongst the trials prompted discussion between the review authors as to whether the data should or should not be pooled; we decided in favour of a quantitative synthesis to provide a rough impression about the effect sizes achievable with US‐based triage algorithms. We pooled mortality data from three trials involving 1254 patients; the RR in favour of the FAST arm was 1.00 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.00). FAST‐based pathways reduced the number of CT scans (random‐effects model RD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.83 to ‐0.21), but the meaning of this result was unclear. Authors' conclusions The experimental evidence justifying FAST‐based clinical pathways in diagnosing patients with suspected abdominal or multiple blunt trauma remains poor. Because of strong heterogeneity between the trial results, the quantitative information provided by this review may only be used in an exploratory fashion. It is unlikely that FAST will ever be investigated by means of a confirmatory, large‐scale RCT in the future. Thus, this Cochrane Review may be regarded as a review which provides the best available evidence for clinical practice guidelines and management recommendations. It can only be concluded from the few head‐to‐head studies that negative US scans are likely to reduce the incidence of MDCT scans which, given the low sensitivity of FAST (or reliability of negative results), may adversely affect the diagnostic yield of the trauma survey. At best, US has no negative impact on mortality or morbidity. Assuming that major blunt abdominal or multiple trauma is associated with 15% mortality and a CT‐based diagnostic work‐up is considered the current standard of care, 874, 3495, or 21,838 patients are needed per intervention group to demonstrate non‐inferiority of FAST to CT‐based algorithms with non‐inferiority margins of 5%, 2.5%, and 1%, power of 90%, and a type‐I error alpha of 5%.","Using ultrasound to aid diagnosis of patients with a 'blunt' injury to the abdomen Many people admitted to hospital after an injury have 'blunt' (not penetrating) damage to the abdomen. Doctors treating these patients need to know whether the organs within the abdomen have been injured. Ultrasound scans are believed to help diagnose the patient's condition. In this review, the authors looked for studies that compared death rates in patients with an abdominal injury where ultrasound was used to aid diagnosis with death rates where no ultrasound was used. They also looked for evidence that ultrasound use could reduce the need to carry out other more complex and more expensive diagnostic tests. However, very few trials have been done and the authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify the use of ultrasound as part of the diagnosis of patients with abdominal injury. Given this degree of uncertainty, it is probably justified to ask doctors on duty for a confirmatory CT scan in patients who have sustained an injury with a high chance of major trauma (that is, head and brain injury, cervical spine fracture, thoraco‐abdominal pelvic trauma, and other injuries).",CD004446
"Background Peripheral nerve blocks can be performed using ultrasound guidance. It is not yet clear whether this method of nerve location has benefits over other existing methods. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2014. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess whether the use of ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blockade has any advantages over other methods of peripheral nerve location. Specifically, we have asked whether the use of ultrasound guidance: 1. improves success rates and effectiveness of regional anaesthetic blocks, by increasing the number of blocks that are assessed as adequate 2. reduces the complications, such as cardiorespiratory arrest, pneumothorax or vascular puncture, associated with the performance of regional anaesthetic blocks Search methods In the 2014 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8); MEDLINE (July 2008 to August 2014); EMBASE (July 2008 to August 2014); ISI Web of Science (2008 to April 2013); CINAHL (July 2014); and LILACS (July 2008 to August 2014). We completed forward and backward citation and clinical trials register searches.The original search was to July 2008. We reran the search in May 2015. We have added 11 potential new studies of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into the formal review findings during future review updates. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ultrasound‐guided peripheral nerve block of the upper and lower limbs, alone or combined, with at least one other method of nerve location .  In the 2014 update, we excluded studies that had given general anaesthetic, spinal, epidural or other nerve blocks to all participants, as well as those measuring the minimum effective dose of anaesthetic drug. This resulted in the exclusion of five studies from the original review. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including an assessment of risk of bias and degree of practitioner experience for all studies. Main results We included 32 RCTs with 2844 adult participants. Twenty‐six assessed upper‐limb and six assessed lower‐limb blocks. Seventeen compared ultrasound with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and nine compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulation (US + NS) against PNS alone. Two studies compared ultrasound with anatomical landmark technique, one with a transarterial approach, and three were three‐arm designs that included US, US + PNS and PNS. There were variations in the quality of evidence, with a lack of detail in many of the studies to judge whether randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors was sufficient. It was not possible to blind practitioners and there was therefore a high risk of performance bias across all studies, leading us to downgrade the evidence for study limitations using GRADE. There was insufficient detail on the experience and expertise of practitioners and whether experience was equivalent between intervention and control. We performed meta‐analysis for our main outcomes. We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior peripheral nerve block success rates, with more blocks being assessed as sufficient for surgery following sensory or motor testing (Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) odds ratio (OR), fixed‐effect 2.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.04); 1346 participants), and fewer blocks requiring supplementation or conversion to general anaesthetic (M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.39); 1807 participants) compared with the use of PNS, anatomical landmark techniques or a transarterial approach. We were not concerned by risks of indirectness, imprecision or inconsistency for these outcomes and used GRADE to assess these outcomes as being of moderate quality. Results were similarly advantageous for studies comparing US + PNS with NS alone for the above outcomes (M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 3.33 (95% CI 2.13 to 5.20); 719 participants, and M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.34 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.56); 712 participants respectively). There were lower incidences of paraesthesia in both the ultrasound comparison groups (M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.42 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.76); 471 participants, and M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.97 (95% CI 0.30 to 3.12); 178 participants respectively) and lower incidences of vascular puncture in both groups (M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.57); 387 participants, and M‐H OR, fixed‐effect 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.90); 143 participants). There were fewer studies for these outcomes and we therefore downgraded both for imprecision and paraesthesia for potential publication bias. This gave an overall GRADE assessment of very low and low for these two outcomes respectively. Our analysis showed that it took less time to perform nerve blocks in the ultrasound group (mean difference (MD), IV, fixed‐effect ‐1.06 (95% CI ‐1.41 to ‐0.72); 690 participants) but more time to perform the block when ultrasound was combined with a PNS technique (MD, IV, fixed‐effect 0.76 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.98); 587 participants). With high levels of unexplained statistical heterogeneity, we graded this outcome as very low quality. We did not combine data for other outcomes as study results had been reported using differing scales or with a combination of mean and median data, but our interpretation of individual study data favoured ultrasound for a reduction in other minor complications and reduction in onset time of block and number of attempts to perform block. Authors' conclusions There is evidence that peripheral nerve blocks performed by ultrasound guidance alone, or in combination with PNS, are superior in terms of improved sensory and motor block, reduced need for supplementation and fewer minor complications reported. Using ultrasound alone shortens performance time when compared with nerve stimulation, but when used in combination with PNS it increases performance time. We were unable to determine whether these findings reflect the use of ultrasound in experienced hands and it was beyond the scope of this review to consider the learning curve associated with peripheral nerve blocks by ultrasound technique compared with other methods.","Ultrasound guidance for upper and lower limb blocks Background Nerve blocks are used to numb all or part of the arms or legs (peripheral blockade) for surgery, or to provide pain relief after the operation, or both. Using ultrasound, anaesthetists can 'see' vital structures below the skin, which should allow them to place the local anaesthetic injection accurately and avoid damaging other tissues or organs. We aimed to assess whether ultrasound has any advantages over other nerve‐locating techniques for nerve blocks of the arms or legs in adults. Study characteristics The evidence is current up to 27 August 2014. We found 32 studies with 2844 participants. Most studies compared ultrasound with electrical nerve stimulators or compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulators against nerve stimulators alone. We reran the search in May 2015. We will deal with the 11 studies of interest when we next update the review. Key results We combined the results of studies using statistical tests and found that nerve blocks were more likely to be assessed as adequate for surgery and were less likely to need additional anaesthetic when performed using ultrasound guidance or ultrasound guidance combined with other techniques. We also found that there were fewer complications such as 'pins and needles' or accidental punctures of blood vessels. It also took less time to perform the nerve block when ultrasound alone was used. Quality of the evidence There was variation in the quality of the studies and authors had not always made sufficient attempts to ensure that the outcome assessors were unaware of what technique had been used for the nerve block. Studies had also often not clearly explained how experienced the people giving the nerve block were. This is particularly important, as ultrasound is still a relatively new technique and some anaesthetists may have limited experience. We rated our evidence for whether the nerve blocks were sufficient and adequate for surgery as of moderate quality, but evidence for our other outcomes was either low or very low. Conclusions Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for peripheral nerve blocks. However, we are unable to say whether this result depends on the experience of the practitioner in the technique being used.",CD006459
"Background Clonidine is a presynaptic alpha‐2‐adrenergic receptor agonist used for many years to treat hypertension and other conditions, including chronic pain. Adverse events associated with systemic use of the drug have limited its application. Topical use of drugs is currently gaining interest, as it may limit adverse events without loss of analgesic efficacy. Topical clonidine (TC) formulations have been investigated recently in clinical trials. Objectives The objectives of this review were to assess the analgesic efficacy of TC for chronic neuropathic pain in adults and to assess the frequency of adverse events associated with clinical use of TC for chronic neuropathic pain. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) Online (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, reference lists of retrieved papers and trial registries, and we contacted experts in the field. We performed the most recent search on 17 September 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised, double‐blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing TC versus placebo or other active treatment in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data from the studies and assessed bias. We planned three tiers of evidence analysis. The first tier was designed to analyse data meeting current best standards, by which studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent) without use of the last observation carried forward or other imputation method for dropouts, reported an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, lasted eight weeks or longer, had a parallel‐group design and included at least 200 participants (preferably at least 400) in the comparison. The second tier was designed to use data from at least 200 participants but in cases in which one of the above conditions was not met. The third tier of evidence was assumed in other situations. Main results We included two studies in the review, with a total of 344 participants. Studies lasted 8 weeks and 12 weeks and compared TC versus placebo. 0.1%. TC was applied in gel form to the painful area two to three times daily. Studies included in this review were subject to potential bias and were classified as of moderate or low quality. One drug manufacturer supported both studies. We found no top‐tier evidence for TC in neuropathic pain. Second‐tier evidence indicated slight improvement after the drug was used in study participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). A greater number of participants in the TC group had at least 30% reduction in pain compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.77; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 8.33, 95% CI 4.3 to 50). Third‐tier evidence indicated that TC was no better than placebo for achieving at least 50% reduction in pain intensity and on the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. The two included studies could be subject to significant bias. We found no studies that reported other neuropathic pain conditions. The rate of adverse events did not differ between groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of mild skin reactions in the placebo group, which should have no clinical significance. Authors' conclusions Limited evidence from a small number of studies of moderate to low quality suggests that TC may provide some benefit in peripheral diabetic neuropathy. The drug may be useful in situations for which no better treatment options are available because of lack of efficacy, contraindications or adverse events. Additional trials are needed to assess TC in other neuropathic pain conditions and to determine how patients who have a chance to respond to the drug should be selected for treatment.","Clonidine applied to the skin for neuropathic pain The aim of this review was to examine how clonidine applied to the skin works in people with neuropathic pain. To answer this question, we searched medical databases up to 17 September 2014. We found only two studies that provided information. They lasted 8 weeks and 12 weeks and included a total of 344 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). One drug manufacturer supported both studies, which were of low quality. From these studies, we know that clonidine applied to the skin probably gives little benefit to patients with PDN, but we cannot be sure of this. Clonidine may provide partial pain relief to one out of eight people treated with it. We do not know how clonidine applied to the skin works in other neuropathic pain conditions. Treatment with the drug for short periods probably will not cause side effects, but we do not know from the studies if clonidine is safe for long‐term use. Researchers have reported no differences in the total numbers of side effects among people taking TC or placebo. The most important message from this review is that clonidine applied to the skin may give partial pain relief for only some people with PDN.",CD010967
"Background Pneumonia is the most common hospital‐acquired infection affecting patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, current national guidelines for the treatment of hospital‐acquired pneumonia (HAP) are several years old and the diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients (VAP) has been subject to considerable recent attention. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP in the critically ill is uncertain. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of short versus prolonged‐course antibiotics for HAP in critically ill adults, including patients with VAP. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2015), MEDLINE in‐process and other non‐indexed citations (5 June 2015), EMBASE (2010 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to June 2015) and Web of Science (1955 to June 2015). Selection criteria We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a fixed 'short' duration of antibiotic therapy with a 'prolonged' course for HAP (including patients with VAP) in critically ill adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors conducted data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. Main results We identified six relevant studies involving 1088 participants. This included two new studies published after the date of our previous review (2011). There was substantial variation in participants, in the diagnostic criteria used to define an episode of pneumonia, in the interventions and in the reported outcomes. We found no evidence relating to patients with a high probability of HAP who were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, overall a short seven‐ or eight‐day course of antibiotics compared with a prolonged 10‐ to 15‐day course increased 28‐day antibiotic‐free days (two studies; N = 431; mean difference (MD) 4.02 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26 to 5.78) and reduced recurrence of VAP due to multi‐resistant organisms (one study; N = 110; odds ratio (OR) 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.95), without adversely affecting mortality and other recurrence outcomes. However, for cases of VAP specifically due to non‐fermenting Gram‐negative bacilli (NF‐GNB), recurrence was greater after short‐course therapy (two studies, N = 176; OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.16), though mortality outcomes were not significantly different. One study found that a three‐day course of antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected HAP but a low Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) was associated with a significantly lower risk of superinfection or emergence of antimicrobial resistance, compared with standard (prolonged) course therapy. Authors' conclusions On the basis of a small number of studies and appreciating the lack of uniform definition of pneumonia, we conclude that for patients with VAP not due to NF‐GNB a short, fixed course (seven or eight days) of antibiotic therapy appears not to increase the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, and may reduce the emergence of resistant organisms, compared with a prolonged course (10 to 15 days). However, for patients with VAP due to NF‐GNB, there appears to be a higher risk of recurrence following short‐course therapy. These findings do not differ from those of our previous review and are broadly consistent with current guidelines. There are few data from RCTs comparing durations of therapy in non‐ventilated patients with HAP, but on the basis of a single study, short‐course (three‐day) therapy for HAP appears not to be associated with worse clinical outcome, and may reduce the risk of subsequent infection or the emergence of resistant organisms when there is low probability of pneumonia according to the CPIS.","Short‐course versus long‐course antibiotic treatment for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in adult intensive care patients Review question   We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of a short course of antibiotics with a long course for intensive care patients with hospital‐acquired pneumonia (HAP). Background   Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is the major cause of hospital‐acquired infection in the intensive care unit (ICU). There are a number of factors that make the critically ill more likely to develop pneumonia, among which the most important is tracheal intubation performed in conjunction with mechanical ventilation; thus, the majority of ICU patients with HAP have what is termed ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). There is concern that an unnecessarily long course of antibiotic therapy may lead to patients acquiring antibiotic‐resistant organisms, which may be more difficult to recognise and treat when they cause infection and may increase drug costs. On the other hand, too short a course risks the treatment failing. Study characteristics   The evidence was current as of June 2015. We identified six RCTs, which had enrolled 1088 patients. The studies took quite different approaches to their investigations, and we found only one study that had explored the duration of antibiotic therapy for ICU patients who had HAP, but were not mechanically ventilated. Key results   For patients with VAP, our main finding was that a course of seven or eight days of antibiotics was associated with an overall decrease in antibiotic administration and reduced the recurrence of pneumonia due to resistant organisms when compared with a 10‐ to 15‐day course. Furthermore, this was achieved without any significant effect on mortality. Nevertheless, in cases when VAP was due to a particular type of organism ('non‐fermenting Gram‐negative bacillus'), which can be difficult to eradicate with antibiotics, the risk of pneumonia recurring appeared higher after a short course of treatment. One study found that for patients with possible (but low probability) HAP a short (three‐day) course of therapy seemed to be associated with a lower chance of acquiring resistant organisms or of subsequent infections being due to a resistant organism. Quality of evidence   The quality of evidence for the main outcome measures was low to moderate. The main reasons that the quality was not high were that only a small number of studies were identified, and that there were differences in patient populations, in the nature of the interventions between studies and in the reported outcomes.",CD007577
"Background Ulceration of the feet, which can lead to the amputation of feet and legs, is a major problem for people with diabetes mellitus, and can cause substantial economic burden. Single preventive strategies have not been shown to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration to a significant extent. Therefore, in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined (complex interventions). Objectives To assess the effectiveness of complex interventions in the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus compared with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions. A complex intervention is defined as an integrated care approach, combining two or more prevention strategies on at least two different levels of care: the patient, the healthcare provider and/or the structure of health care. Search methods For the second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 22 May 2015), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 May 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations 21 May, 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 21 May, 2015) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 22 May, 2015). Selection criteria Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effectiveness of combinations of preventive strategies, not solely patient education, for the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus, with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors were assigned to independently select studies, to extract study data and to assess risk of bias of included studies, using predefined criteria. Main results Only six RCTs met the criteria for inclusion. The study characteristics differed substantially in terms of healthcare settings, the nature of the interventions studied and outcome measures reported. In three studies that compared the effect of an education‐centred complex intervention with usual care or written instructions, only little evidence of benefit was found. Three studies compared the effect of more intensive and comprehensive complex interventions with usual care. One study found a significant and cost‐effective reduction, one of lower extremity amputations (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71). One other study found a significant reduction of both amputation and foot ulcers. The last study reported improvement of patients' self care behaviour. All six included RCTs were at high risk of bias, with hardly any of the predefined quality assessment criteria met. Authors' conclusions There is no high‐quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.","Combined strategies to avoid foot ulcers in patients with diabetes Foot ulcers (open sores) are common in people with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2), especially those with problems in the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), the blood supply to their legs (peripheral vascular disease) or both. People with ulcers due to diabetes will sometimes need an amputation (surgical removal of part of the limb). Foot ulcers not only lead to physical disability and loss of quality of life, but also to economic burden (healthcare costs, industrial disability). The aim is therefore to prevent foot ulcers occurring, for example, by showing patients with diabetes how to look after their feet or by prompting doctors to check their patients' feet more often. The results of single prevention strategies alone have so far been disappointing, therefore in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined. In this review of trials of complex, preventive interventions, we found insufficient evidence that these combined approaches can be effective in reducing foot problems.",CD007610
"Background Postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH) is a significant complication following vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). It delays visual recovery and can make further treatment difficult if the view of the fundus is significantly obscured. A number of interventions to reduce the incidence of POVCH have been proposed, including the perioperative use of anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF). Anti‐VEGFs reduce vascular proliferation and the vascularity of neovascular tissue, which is often the source of bleeding following vitrectomy. Objectives This updated review aimed to summarise the effects of anti‐VEGF use to reduce the occurrence of POVCH after vitrectomy surgery for PDR. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2015), PubMed (January 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2015), the ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), and the the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 May 2015. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that looked at the use of anti‐VEGFs and the incidence of POVCH in people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes of the review were the incidence of early and late POVCH following perioperative anti‐VEGF administration. Secondary outcomes included best‐corrected visual acuity at six months following surgery, the incidence of vitreous cavity washout or revision vitrectomy at six months, adverse effects of intervention (cataract, iris rubeosis and rubeotic glaucoma, retinal detachment, increased inflammation and systemic side effects), quality of life measures performed at least six months following vitrectomy, and density of POVCH. Main results The current review included 12 RCTs that looked at the pre‐ or intraoperative use of intravitreal bevacizumab to prevent postoperative vitreous haemorrhage during pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Egypt, and the remaining from South Korea, USA, Mexico, Pakistan, and Japan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were standard complications of proliferative retinopathy: non‐clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula, or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 654 eyes. The average age of the participants was 54 years. We identified methodological issues in all included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators (four studies were an 'open label' design), and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation. Participants receiving intravitreal bevacizumab in addition to pars plana vitrectomy were less likely to experience early POVCH (grade 2) compared to people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.96, 2 studies, 144 eyes, high‐quality evidence). This corresponds to an absolute effect of 130 fewer people (95% CI 167 fewer to 7 fewer) with early POVCH per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. We saw similar results for all grades of POVCH (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53, 9 studies, 512 eyes) and when excluding cases where assessment of outcome was impossible due to presence of silicone oil (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60, 6 studies, 302 eyes). The effect of pre‐ or intraoperative intravitreal bevacizumab on the incidence of late postoperative haemorrhage was uncertain (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.72, 3 studies, 196 eyes, low‐quality evidence). The absolute effect was 55 fewer people (95% CI 138 fewer to 143 more) with late POVCH per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. This outcome was rarer and was only reported in a few studies. We are currently unable to provide an estimate of the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on postoperative visual acuity due to significant study heterogeneity. No local or systemic complications of intravitreal bevacizumab were reported by the RCTs. The risk of postoperative retinal detachment was lower in the participants treated with pre‐ or intraoperative bevacizumab (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.08, 7 studies, 372 participants, low‐quality evidence); the absolute effect was 49 fewer people (95% CI:73 fewer to 8 more) with postoperative retinal detachment per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. Authors' conclusions The use of pre‐ or intraoperative bevacizumab lowers the incidence of early POVCH. The reported complications from its use appear to be low. Futher randomised studies that look at other anti‐VEGF medications are ongoing and will strengthen the current review findings, giving both surgeons and patients evidence to guide treatment choices in the management of proliferative retinopathy.","Anti‐VEGF for prevention of postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage after vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy Review question   Does anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) reduce the occurrence of posterior vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH) after vitrectomy surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy? Background   POVCH is a significant complication following vitrectomy (removal of the vitreous gel from the posterior chamber of the eye) for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy (the growth of abnormal blood vessels from the retina, a layer of tissue at the back of the eye), occurring in approximately 30% of cases. POVCH has two main forms: early, when haemorrhage (bleeding) is present in the first few postoperative days, and late, when haemorrhage occurs a number of months after surgery. The presence of POVCH delays visual recovery, can lead to elevated pressure within the eye, and can make further treatment for diabetic retinopathy difficult. Ten per cent of patients require revision surgery, which has significant implications for resources, time, and cost. The use of anti‐VEGF before surgery (preoperatively) has been proposed as an intervention to reduce the incidence of POVCH. Search date   The evidence is up to date to May 2015. Key results   The electronic database searches identified 12 randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. We performed a number of analyses that suggest that pre‐ or intraoperative anti‐VEGF may reduce the incidence of early POVCH. The effect on late POVCH was unclear. We are currently unable to comment on the effect of anti‐VEGF treatment on postoperative visual acuity due to significant differences in the studies' design and outcomes. The risk of adverse events when using preoperative anti‐VEGF appears small. Quality of evidence   We are reasonably certain that anti‐VEGF reduces the incidence of early POVCH (high‐quality evidence) but less certain about its effects on late POVCH and risk of adverse effects.",CD008214
"Background Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs that act by blocking prostaglandin production. They inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX‐1 and COX‐2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non‐selective' because they inhibit both COX‐1 and COX‐2 enzymes. More selective NSAIDs that solely target COX‐2 enzymes (COX‐2‐specific inhibitors) were launched in 1999 with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of NSAIDs in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. Search methods We searched the following databases in January 2015: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, November 2014 issue), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We checked the abstracts of major scientific meetings and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of NSAIDs versus placebo, other NSAIDs or paracetamol, when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data, calculating odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used inverse variance methods to combine data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women). They compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non‐selective and two COX‐2‐specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs versus placebo Among women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I 2  = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I 2  = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I 2  = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I 2  = 0%, low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs versus other NSAIDs When NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety. However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials. Non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2‐specific selectors Only two of the included studies utilised COX‐2‐specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib). There was no evidence that COX‐2‐specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty. NSAIDs versus paracetamol NSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I 2  = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%); a further 31% failed to state their source of funding. Authors' conclusions NSAIDs appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk of adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the safest and most effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.","Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea Review question Are nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) safe and effective for relief of period pain (dysmenorrhoea) and how do they compare with each other and with paracetamol? Background Nearly three‐quarters of women suffer from period pain or menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea). Research has shown that women with severe period pain have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. NSAIDs are drugs which act by blocking prostaglandin production. NSAIDs include the common painkillers aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the safety and effectiveness of NSAIDs for period pain. The evidence is current to January 2015. Study characteristics We found 80 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 5820 women and compared 20 different types of NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive pill), paracetamol or each other. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%), and a further 31% did not state their source of funding. Key results The review found that NSAIDs appear to be very effective in relieving period pain. The evidence suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs appear to work better than paracetamol, but it is unclear whether any one NSAID is safer or more effective than others. NSAIDs commonly cause adverse effects (side effects), including indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so. Based on two studies that made head‐to‐head comparisons, there was no evidence that newer types of NSAID (known as COX‐2‐specific inhibitors) are more effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs (known as non‐selective inhibitors), nor that there is a difference between them with regard to adverse effects. Quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.",CD001751
"Background Selenium is a trace mineral essential to health and has an important role in immunity, defence against tissue damage and thyroid function. Improving selenium status could help protect against overwhelming tissue damage and infection in critically ill adults. This Cochrane review was originally published in 2004 updated in 2007 and again 2015. Objectives The primary objective was to examine the effect of nutrition supplemented with selenium or ebselen on mortality in critically ill patients. The secondary objective was to examine the relationship between selenium or ebselen supplementation and number of infections, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay and length of hospital stay. Search methods In this update, we searched the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library (2014 ,  Issue 5); MEDLINE (Ovid SP, to May 20, 2014), EMBASE (Ovid SP, to May 20, 2014), CAB, BIOSIS and CINAHL. We handsearched the reference lists of the newest reviews and cross‐checked with our search in MEDLINE. We contacted the main authors of included studies to request any missed, unreported or ongoing studies. The latest search was performed up to 21 May 2014. The search is now from inception until 21 May 2014. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published or language. We contacted the trial investigators and authors in order to retrieve relevant and missing data. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and we resolved any disagreements by discussion. Our primary outcome measure was all‐cause mortality. We performed several subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of selenium in critically ill patients. We presented pooled estimates of the effects of intervention as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risk of bias through assessment of trial methodological components and the risk of random error through trial sequential analysis. Main results We included six new RCTs in this review update. In total we included 16 RCTs (2084 participants) in this review. Most trials were at high risk of bias. The availability of outcome data was limited and trials involving selenium supplementation were, with the exception of one trial, small regarding sample size. Thus the results must be interpreted with caution. Thirteen trials of intravenous sodium selenite showed a statistically significant reduction in overall mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.93, 1391 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). However, the overall point estimate on mortality is primarily influenced by trials of high risk of bias. Meta‐analysis of three trials of ebselen had a RR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, 693 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). Nine trials of intravenous sodium selenite were analysed for 28 days mortality with no statistically significant difference (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02, 1180 participants,  very low quality of evidence ) while three trials were analysed for 90 days mortality with similar findings (RR 0.96, 95% Cl 0.78 to 1.18, 614 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). Two trials of ebselen were analysed for 90 days mortality and were not found to yield any benefit (RR 0.72, 95% Cl 0.42 to 1.22, 588 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). For mortality among intensive care patients selenium supplementation failed to indicate any statistically significant advantage (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01, nine trials, 1168 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). Six trials of intravenous sodium selenite found no statistically significant difference for participants developing infection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.23, 934 patients,  very low quality of evidence ). Similarly, three trials of ebselen provided data for participants developing infections (pyrexia, respiratory infections or meningitis) with no obvious benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.02, 685 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). Our analyses showed no effect of selenium or ebselen on adverse events (Selenium: RR 1.03, 95% Cl 0.85 to 1.24; six trials, 925 participants ; Ebselen: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.36; two trials, 588 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). No clear evidence emerged in favour of selenium supplementation for outcomes such as number of days on a ventilator (mean difference (MD) ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐4.39 to 2.67, four trials, 191 participants,  very low quality of evidence ), length of intensive care unit stay (MD 0.54, 95% CI ‐2.27 to 3.34, seven trials, 934 participants,  very low quality of evidence ) or length of hospital stay (MD ‐3.33, 95% Cl ‐5.22 to ‐1.44, five trials, 693 participants,  very low quality of evidence ). The quality of trial methodology was low. Due to high risk of bias in the included trials, results must be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions Despite publication of a number of trials, the current evidence to recommend supplementation of critically ill patients with selenium or ebselen remains disputed. Trials are required which overcome the methodological inadequacies of the reviewed studies, particularly in relation to sample size, design and outcomes.","Selenium supplements for adults who are critically ill Selenium is a mineral that is essential to health. It has an important role in defence against tissue damage and disease. Improving selenium status could help protect adults with serious illness. In this updated review, Cochrane researchers assessed the effects of additional selenium supplementation for adults recovering from critical illness. We investigated whether the number of people who died changed by giving a selenium supplement during their treatment. Also we checked the impact of such a strategy on the rate of infections and other diseases for these patients while in hospital. We also examined whether selenium affected the duration of respiratory assistance for patients on ventilators and the length of their stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital. We included 16 trials with 2084 participants. Thirteen trials carried out tests with selenium while three trials examined selenium‐containing compound ebselen. Overall quality of the included trials was poor, with little information on quality indicators. The results were limited and these trials involving selenium supplementation were mostly small. In most trials, there was a high risk of poor or even incorrect information. Thus the results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is current to 21 May 2014. Thirteen trials of intravenous sodium selenite showed a statistically significant effect on death. Three trials of the selenium‐containing compound ebselen showed no effect on death. No effects on infections or secondary diseases were observed. No clear evidence emerged for the benefits of selenium or ebselen supplementation for days on a respirator, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay or quality of life. Due to the quality of included trials, one must be cautious when interpreting the strength of the evidence in favour of selenium supplementation despite a statistically significant finding. Overall, there was low quality evidence from the studies for the all results. Trials are required which overcome the statistical uncertainty of the reviewed studies, particularly in relation to sample size, design and outcomes.",CD003703
"Background Self‐administered survey questionnaires are an important data collection tool in clinical practice, public health research and epidemiology. They are ideal for achieving a wide geographic coverage of the target population, dealing with sensitive topics and are less resource‐intensive than other data collection methods. These survey questionnaires can be delivered electronically, which can maximise the scalability and speed of data collection while reducing cost. In recent years, the use of apps running on consumer smart devices (i.e., smartphones and tablets) for this purpose has received considerable attention. However, variation in the mode of delivering a survey questionnaire could affect the quality of the responses collected. Objectives To assess the impact that smartphone and tablet apps as a delivery mode have on the quality of survey questionnaire responses compared to any other alternative delivery mode: paper, laptop computer, tablet computer (manufactured before 2007), short message service (SMS) and plastic objects. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, IEEEXplore, Web of Science, CABI: CAB Abstracts, Current Contents Connect, ACM Digital, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts, Health Management Information Consortium, the Campbell Library and CENTRAL. We also searched registers of current and ongoing clinical trials such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched the grey literature in OpenGrey, Mobile Active and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses. Lastly, we searched Google Scholar and the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We performed all searches up to 12 and 13 April 2015. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover trials and paired repeated measures studies that compared the electronic delivery of self‐administered survey questionnaires via a smartphone or tablet app with any other delivery mode. We included data obtained from participants completing health‐related self‐administered survey questionnaire, both validated and non‐validated. We also included data offered by both healthy volunteers and by those with any clinical diagnosis. We included studies that reported any of the following outcomes: data equivalence; data accuracy; data completeness; response rates; differences in the time taken to complete a survey questionnaire; differences in respondent's adherence to the original sampling protocol; and acceptability to respondents of the delivery mode. We included studies that were published in 2007 or after, as devices that became available during this time are compatible with the mobile operating system (OS) framework that focuses on apps. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies using a standardised form created for this systematic review in REDCap. They then compared their forms to reach consensus. Through an initial systematic mapping on the included studies, we identified two settings in which survey completion took place: controlled and uncontrolled. These settings differed in terms of (i) the location where surveys were completed, (ii) the frequency and intensity of sampling protocols, and (iii) the level of control over potential confounders (e.g., type of technology, level of help offered to respondents). We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence because a meta‐analysis was not appropriate due to high levels of clinical and methodological diversity. We reported our findings for each outcome according to the setting in which the studies were conducted. Main results We included 14 studies (15 records) with a total of 2275 participants; although we included only 2272 participants in the final analyses as there were missing data for three participants from one included study. Regarding data equivalence, in both controlled and uncontrolled settings, the included studies found no significant differences in the mean overall scores between apps and other delivery modes, and that all correlation coefficients exceeded the recommended thresholds for data equivalence. Concerning the time taken to complete a survey questionnaire in a controlled setting, one study found that an app was faster than paper, whereas the other study did not find a significant difference between the two delivery modes. In an uncontrolled setting, one study found that an app was faster than SMS. Data completeness and adherence to sampling protocols were only reported in uncontrolled settings. Regarding the former, an app was found to result in more complete records than paper, and in significantly more data entries than an SMS‐based survey questionnaire. Regarding adherence to the sampling protocol, apps may be better than paper but no different from SMS. We identified multiple definitions of acceptability to respondents, with inconclusive results: preference; ease of use; willingness to use a delivery mode; satisfaction; effectiveness of the system informativeness; perceived time taken to complete the survey questionnaire; perceived benefit of a delivery mode; perceived usefulness of a delivery mode; perceived ability to complete a survey questionnaire; maximum length of time that participants would be willing to use a delivery mode; and reactivity to the delivery mode and its successful integration into respondents' daily routine. Finally, regardless of the study setting, none of the included studies reported data accuracy or response rates. Authors' conclusions Our results, based on a narrative synthesis of the evidence, suggest that apps might not affect data equivalence as long as the intended clinical application of the survey questionnaire, its intended frequency of administration and the setting in which it was validated remain unchanged. There were no data on data accuracy or response rates, and findings on the time taken to complete a self‐administered survey questionnaire were contradictory. Furthermore, although apps might improve data completeness, there is not enough evidence to assess their impact on adherence to sampling protocols. None of the included studies assessed how elements of user interaction design, survey questionnaire design and intervention design might influence mode effects. Those conducting research in public health and epidemiology should not assume that mode effects relevant to other delivery modes apply to apps running on consumer smart devices. Those conducting methodological research might wish to explore the issues highlighted by this systematic review.","Can apps be used for the delivery of survey questionnaires in public health and clinical research? Background Survey questionnaires are important tools in public health and clinical research as they offer a convenient way of collecting data from a large number of respondents, dealing with sensitive topics, and are less resource intensive than other data collection techniques. The delivery of survey questionnaires via apps running on smartphones or tablets could maximise the scalability and speed of data collection offered by these tools, whilst reducing costs. However, before this technology becomes widely adopted, we need to understand how it could affect the quality of the responses collected. Particularly, if we consider the impact that data quality can have on the evidence base that supports many public health and healthcare decisions. Objective In this Cochrane review, we assessed the impact that using apps to deliver a survey can have on various aspects of the quality of responses. These include response rates, data accuracy, data completeness, time taken to complete a survey questionnaire, and acceptability to respondents. Methods and results We searched for studies published between January 2007 and April 2015. We included 14 studies and analysed data from 2272 participants. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis because of differences across the studies. Instead, we describe the results of each study. The studies took place in two types of setting: controlled and uncontrolled. The former refers to research or clinical environments in which healthcare practitioners or researchers were able to better control for potential confounders, such as the location and time of day in which surveys were completed, the type of technology used and the level of help available to respondents deal with technical difficulties. Uncontrolled settings refer to locations outside these research or clinical environments (e.g., the respondent's home). We found that apps may be equivalent to other delivery modes such as paper, laptops and SMS in both settings. It is unclear if apps could result in faster completion times than other delivery modes. Instead, our findings suggest that factors such as the characteristics of the clinical population, and survey and interface design could moderate the effect on this outcome. Data completeness and adherence to sampling protocols were only reported in uncontrolled settings. Our results indicate that apps may result in more complete datasets, and may improve adherence to sampling protocols compared to paper but not to SMS. There were multiple definitions of acceptability to respondents, which could not be standardised across the included studies. Lastly, none of the included studies reported on response rates or data accuracy. Conclusion Overall, there is not enough evidence to make clear recommendations about the impact that apps may have on survey questionnaire responses. Data equivalence may not be affected as long as the intended clinical application of a survey questionnaire and its intended frequency of administration is the same whether or not apps are used. Future research may need to consider how the design of the user interaction, survey questionnaire and intervention may affect data equivalence and the other outcomes evaluated in this review.",MR000042
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 8, 2011, on 'Drug therapy for treating post‐dural puncture headache'. Post‐dural puncture headache (PDPH) is the most common complication of lumbar puncture, an invasive procedure frequently performed in the emergency room. Numerous pharmaceutical drugs have been proposed to treat PDPH but there are still some uncertainties about their clinical effectiveness. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of drugs for treating PDPH in adults and children. Search methods The searches included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process (from 1950 to 29 July 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 29 July 2014) and CINAHL (from 1982 to July 2014). There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of any pharmacological drug used for treating PDPH. Outcome measures considered for this review were: PDPH persistence of any severity at follow‐up (primary outcome), daily activity limited by headache, conservative supplementary therapeutic option offered, epidural blood patch performed, change in pain severity scores, improvements in pain severity scores, number of days participants stay in hospital, any possible adverse events and missing data. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We calculated a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each RR and MD. We did not undertake meta‐analysis because the included studies assessed different sorts of drugs or different outcomes. We performed an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis. Main results We included 13 small RCTs (479 participants) in this review (at least 274 participants were women, with 118 parturients after a lumbar puncture for regional anaesthesia). In the original version of this Cochrane review, only seven small RCTs (200 participants) were included. Pharmacological drugs assessed were oral and intravenous caffeine, subcutaneous sumatriptan, oral gabapentin, oral pregabalin, oral theophylline, intravenous hydrocortisone, intravenous cosyntropin and intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Two RCTs reported data for PDPH persistence of any severity at follow‐up (primary outcome). Caffeine reduced the number of participants with PDPH at one to two hours when compared to placebo. Treatment with caffeine also decreased the need for a conservative supplementary therapeutic option. Treatment with gabapentin resulted in better visual analogue scale (VAS) scores after one, two, three and four days when compared with placebo and also when compared with ergotamine plus caffeine at two, three and four days. Treatment with hydrocortisone plus conventional treatment showed better VAS scores at six, 24 and 48 hours when compared with conventional treatment alone and also when compared with placebo. Treatment with theophylline showed better VAS scores compared with acetaminophen at two, six and 12 hours and also compared with conservative treatment at eight, 16 and 24 hours. Theophylline also showed a lower mean ""sum of pain"" when compared with placebo. Sumatriptan and ACTH did not show any relevant effect for this outcome. Theophylline resulted in a higher proportion of participants reporting an improvement in pain scores when compared with conservative treatment. There were no clinically significant drug adverse events. The rest of the outcomes were not reported by the included RCTs or did not show any relevant effect. Authors' conclusions None of the new included studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions of the last published version of the original Cochrane review. Caffeine has shown effectiveness for treating PDPH, decreasing the proportion of participants with PDPH persistence and those requiring supplementary interventions, when compared with placebo. Gabapentin, hydrocortisone and theophylline have been shown to decrease pain severity scores. Theophylline has also been shown to increase the proportion of participants that report an improvement in pain scores when compared with conventional treatment. There is a lack of conclusive evidence for the other drugs assessed (sumatriptan, adrenocorticotropic hormone, pregabalin and cosyntropin). These conclusions should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of information to allow correct appraisal of risk of bias, the small sample sizes of the studies and also their limited generalisability, as nearly half of the participants were postpartum women in their 30s.","Drugs for treating headache after a lumbar puncture Lumbar puncture involves getting a sample of spinal fluid though a needle inserted into the lower back. Post‐dural puncture headache (PDPH) is the most common side effect of a lumbar puncture. The symptom of PDPH is a constant headache that gets worse when upright and improves when lying down. Lots of drugs are used to treat PDPH, so the aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of these drugs. This is an updated review, and we searched for new trials in July 2014. We included 13 small randomised clinical trials (RCTs), with a total of 479 participants. The trials assessed eight drugs: caffeine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, hydrocortisone, theophylline, adrenocorticotropic hormone, pregabalin and cosyntropin. Caffeine proved to be effective in decreasing the number of people with PDPH and those requiring extra drugs (2 or 3 in 10 with caffeine compared to 9 in 10 with placebo). Gabapentin, theophylline and hydrocortisone also proved to be effective, relieving pain better than placebo or conventional treatment alone. More people had better pain relief with theophylline (9 in 10 with theophylline compared to 4 in 10 with conventional treatment). No important side effects of these drugs were reported. The quality of the studies was difficult to assess due to the lack of information available. Conclusions should be interpreted with caution.",CD007887
"Background It has been unclear whether repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids are beneficial. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 January 2015), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted authors for further data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of women who had already received a single course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and considered still at risk of preterm birth. Data collection and analysis We assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Main results We included 10 trials (a total of 4733 women and 5700 babies) with low to moderate risk of bias. Treatment of women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with repeat dose(s), compared with no repeat corticosteroid treatment, reduced the risk of their infants experiencing the primary outcomes  respiratory distress syndrome  (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.91, eight trials, 3206 infants, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 17, 95% CI 11 to 32) and  serious infant outcome  (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, seven trials, 5094 infants, NNTB 30, 95% CI 19 to 79). Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in  mean birthweight  (mean difference (MD) ‐75.79 g, 95% CI ‐117.63 to ‐33.96, nine trials, 5626 infants). However, outcomes that adjusted birthweight for gestational age (birthweight Z scores, birthweight multiples of the median and small‐for‐gestational age) did not differ between treatment groups. At early childhood follow‐up, no statistically significant differences were seen for infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with unexposed infants for the primary outcomes (total deaths; survival free of any disability or major disability; disability; or serious outcome) or in the secondary outcome growth assessments. In women, for the two primary outcomes, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of  chorioamnionitis  or  puerperal sepsis , and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged. Authors' conclusions The short‐term benefits for babies of less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. These benefits were associated with a small reduction in size at birth. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm in early childhood, although no benefit. Further research is needed on the long‐term benefits and risks for the woman and baby. Individual patient data meta‐analysis may clarify how to maximise benefit and minimise harm.","Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease This review shows that a repeat dose of prenatal corticosteroids given to women who remain at risk of an early birth after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids helps the baby's lungs and reduces serious health problems in the first few weeks of life. Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) are at risk of difficulty breathing and lung disease because their lungs are not fully developed. Women at risk of preterm birth include those with ruptured membranes, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm labour, cervical incompetence, pre‐eclampsia or multiple pregnancy. Preterm babies who survive the early weeks of life are also at risk of long‐term neurological disabilities such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy. A single course of corticosteroids, given to women who may give birth early, helps develop the baby's lungs. This benefit does not last beyond seven days. This review of 10 randomised controlled trials, involving 4733 women who remained at risk of early birth more than seven days after an initial course of corticosteroids and 5700 babies between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation at trial enrolment showed that repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids reduced the risk of the baby having breathing difficulties and serious health problems in the first few weeks of life. Some of the trials showed that the baby may be smaller at birth, but not if adjusted for gestational age nor by the time of hospital discharge. In four trials that followed up the babies to early childhood, no long‐term benefits or harms were seen at 18 months to two years' corrected age. Further research is needed on the long‐term benefits and risks for the woman and baby, which should include later child health, growth and development. Repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment could increase the risk of infection and suppress pituitary‐adrenal function for the mother and her baby. For the women, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis, and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged. Betamethasone was the only corticosteroid evaluated. It is uncertain whether the effects seen for betamethasone would be the same for dexamethasone.",CD003935
"Background Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of early morbidity and mortality in most developed countries. Secondary prevention aims to prevent repeat cardiac events and death in people with established CHD. Lifestyle modifications play an important role in secondary prevention. Yoga has been regarded as a type of physical activity as well as a stress management strategy. Growing evidence suggests the beneficial effects of yoga on various ailments. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of yoga for the secondary prevention of mortality and morbidity in, and on the health‐related quality of life of, individuals with CHD. Search methods This is an update of a review previously published in 2012. For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 1 of 12, 2014), MEDLINE (1948 to February week 1 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 6), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, 1970 to 12 February 2014), China Journal Net (1994 to May 2014), WanFang Data (1990 to May 2014), and Index to Chinese Periodicals of Hong Kong (HKInChiP) (from 1980). Ongoing studies were identified in the  meta Register of Controlled Trials (May 2014) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (May 2014). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the influence of yoga practice on CHD outcomes in men and women (aged 18 years and over) with a diagnosis of acute or chronic CHD. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had a follow‐up duration of six months or more. We considered studies that compared one group practicing a type of yoga with a control group receiving either no intervention or interventions other than yoga. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies according to prespecified inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements either by consensus or by discussion with a third author. Main results We found no eligible RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of the review and thus we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD remains uncertain. Large RCTs of high quality are needed.","Yoga for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of early cardiovascular‐related illness and death in most developed countries. Secondary prevention is a term used to describe interventions that aim to prevent repeat cardiac events and death in people with established CHD. Individuals with CHD are at the highest risk of coronary events and death. Lifestyle modifications play an important role in secondary prevention. Yoga has been regarded as both a type of physical activity and a stress management strategy. The physical and psychological benefits of yoga are well accepted, yet inappropriate practice of yoga may lead to musculoskeletal injuries, such as muscle soreness and strain. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD in terms of cardiac events, death, and health‐related quality of life. We found no randomised controlled trials which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Therefore, the effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD remains uncertain. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are needed. This is an update of a review previously published in 2012.",CD009506
"Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) (or atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects children and adults and has an important impact on quality of life. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first‐line therapy for this condition; however, they can be associated with significant adverse effects when used chronically. Tacrolimus ointment (in its 2 manufactured strengths of 0.1% and 0.03%) might be an alternative treatment. Tacrolimus, together with pimecrolimus, are drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs). Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for moderate and severe atopic dermatitis compared with other active treatments. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 3 June 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT database). We searched six trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We contacted specialists in the field for unpublished data. A separate search for adverse effects of topical tacrolimus was undertaken in MEDLINE and EMBASE on 30 July 2013. We also scrutinised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites for adverse effects information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (both children and adults) using topical tacrolimus at any dose, course duration, and follow‐up time compared with other active treatments. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and examined the full text of selected studies for compliance with eligibility criteria, risk of bias, and data extraction. Our three prespecified primary outcomes were physician's assessment, participant's self‐assessment of improvement, and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of improvement of the disease by validated or objective measures, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), and BSA (Body Surface Area) scores. Main results We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants. The variability of drug doses, outcomes, and follow‐up periods made it difficult to carry out meta‐analyses. A single trial showed that tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low‐potency TCS by the physician's assessment (risk ratio (RR) 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.45, 1 study, n = 371, moderate‐quality evidence). It was also marginally better than low‐potency TCS on face and neck areas and moderate‐potency TCS on the trunk and extremities by the physician's assessment (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.49, 1 study, n = 972, moderate level of evidence) and for some of the secondary outcomes. Compared with pimecrolimus 1%, people treated with tacrolimus were almost twice as likely to improve by the physician's assessment (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.42, 2 studies, n = 506, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with the lower concentration of 0.03%, the tacrolimus 0.1% formulation reduced the risk of not having an improvement by 18% as evaluated by the physician's assessment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, 6 studies, n = 1640, high‐quality evidence). Tacrolimus 0.1% compared with moderate‐to‐potent TCS showed no difference by the physician's assessment, and 2 secondary outcomes (1 study, 377 participants) and a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% was found by the participant's assessment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29, 1 study, n = 974, low quality of evidence) and SCORAD. Based on data from 2 trials, tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild TCS for the physician's assessment (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.38, 2 studies, n = 790, moderate‐quality evidence) and the participant's self‐assessment (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.90, 1 study, n = 416, moderate quality of evidence). One trial showed moderate benefit of tacrolimus 0.03% compared with pimecrolimus 1% on the physician's assessment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, 1 study, n = 139, low‐quality evidence), but the effects were equivocal when evaluating BSA. In the comparison of tacrolimus 0.03% with moderate‐to‐potent corticosteroids, no difference was found in most of the outcomes measured (including physician's and participant's assessment and also for the secondary outcomes), but in two studies, a marginal benefit favouring the corticosteroid group was found for the EASI and BSA scores. Burning was more frequent in those using calcineurin inhibitors than those using corticosteroid tacrolimus 0.03% (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.14, 5 studies, 1883 participants, high‐quality evidence), but no difference was found for skin infections. Symptoms observed were mild and transient. The comparison between the two calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) showed the same overall incidence of adverse events, but with a small difference in the frequency of local effects. Serious adverse events were rare; occurred in both the tacrolimus and corticosteroid groups; and in most cases, were considered to be unrelated to the treatment. No cases of lymphoma were noted in the included studies nor in the non‐comparative studies. Cases were only noted in spontaneous reports, cohorts, and case‐control studies. Systemic absorption was rarely detectable, only in low levels, and this decreased with time. Exception is made for diseases with severe barrier defects, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and a few others, with case reports of a higher absorption. We evaluated clinical trials; case reports; and in vivo, in vitro, and animal studies; and didn't find any evidence that topical tacrolimus could cause skin atrophy. Authors' conclusions Tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low‐potency corticosteroids, pimecrolimus 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03%. Results were equivocal when comparing both dose formulations to moderate‐to‐potent corticosteroids. Tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild corticosteroids and pimecrolimus. Both tacrolimus formulations seemed to be safe, and no evidence was found to support the possible increased risk of malignancies or skin atrophy with their use. The reliability and strength of the evidence was limited by the lack of data; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. We did not evaluate costs.","Topical tacrolimus for atopic dermatitis Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) (or atopic eczema) is a chronic skin condition that affects the quality of life of both adults and children. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the main ointments used for treatment, but there is a risk of side‐effects with their use, such as skin thinning. A class of drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors, which include topical tacrolimus (and pimecrolimus), might provide an alternative to this problem, but since tacrolimus is a newer ointment compared with corticosteroids, there are still some questions about its effectiveness and safety. Review question Is tacrolimus ointment an effective and safe alternative to other treatments for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (in children and adults)? Study characteristics We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants, in this review. We searched for studies until June 2015. We were interested in the physicians' assessment of improvement, the participants' self‐assessment, and any adverse effects. Other outcomes were by objective measures of improvement, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, a tool for measuring atopic dermatitis severity) and the affected body surface area. Key results We found tacrolimus 0.1% to be better than low‐potency TCS on the face and neck areas and moderate‐potency TCS on the trunk and extremities. We evaluated the physician's assessment of pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.03% in most of the studies. When compared with moderate‐to‐potent corticosteroids, there was a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% by the participant's self‐assessment and SCORAD. Combined results of 2 studies indicated that tacrolimus 0.03% more than doubled the chance of achieving improvement by the physician's assessment compared with mild TCS. Another study found tacrolimus 0.03% to be better than pimecrolimus 1% for the same outcome, while no difference was found on the body surface area of skin affected with disease. For the comparison with moderate‐to‐potent corticosteroids, we found no significant difference in most of the results, but in two studies, we found a slight difference favouring the corticosteroids group. Burning and itching were more frequent in those using tacrolimus than TCS, but we found no difference in skin infection. Symptoms were mild and temporary. The comparison between pimecrolimus and tacrolimus showed the same overall frequency of side‐effects, with local side‐effects being more frequent in the tacrolimus groups. Tacrolimus also showed a longer duration of the local symptoms, between 30 minutes and 12 hours, while pimecrolimus users experienced symptoms for less than 30 minutes. Serious adverse events were rare, occurred both in tacrolimus and TCS groups, and were considered to be unrelated to treatment in most instances. No cases of lymphoma (a type of cancer of the lymph nodes) were noted in the included studies nor in the non‐comparative studies. Cases were only noted retrospectively in studies and reports, with no confirmed relation to the drug. Systemic absorption (substance entering the bloodstream) was rarely detectable, only in low levels and decreased with time. Only in diseases with severe skin barrier problems, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis (rare genetic disorders), and a few others, were there case reports of systemic absorption. After evaluating clinical trials, case reports, human and animal studies, we found a lack of evidence associating the use of topical tacrolimus with skin thinning. In summary, tacrolimus ointment seems to be safe and effective for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults. It should be used with caution, though, in those having diseases with a severely damaged skin barrier. We found no risk of skin thinning with its use, even for longer periods. We did not find any evidence associating a risk of malignancies with the use of topical tacrolimus. We did not evaluate costs in this review. Quality of the evidence The variability of drug doses, results, and follow‐up periods made it difficult to combine the results. The lack of data limited the reliability and strength of the evidence; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution.",CD009864
"Background In the UK, dementia affects 5% of the population aged over 65 years and 25% of those over 85 years. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represents one subtype and is thought to account for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. Although the core of the diagnostic process in dementia rests firmly on clinical and cognitive assessments, a wide range of investigations are available to aid diagnosis. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established clinical tool that uses an intravenously injected radiolabelled tracer to map blood flow in the brain. In FTD the characteristic pattern seen is hypoperfusion of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. This pattern of blood flow is different to patterns seen in other subtypes of dementia and so can be used to differentiate FTD. It has been proposed that a diagnosis of FTD, (particularly early stage), should be made not only on the basis of clinical criteria but using a combination of other diagnostic findings, including rCBF SPECT. However, more extensive testing comes at a financial cost, and with a potential risk to patient safety and comfort. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in populations with suspected dementia in secondary/tertiary healthcare settings and in the differential diagnosis of FTD from other dementia subtypes. Search methods Our search strategy used two concepts: (a) the index test and (b) the condition of interest. We searched citation databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), BIOSIS (Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (Bireme), using structured search strategies appropriate for each database. In addition we searched specialised sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews including: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) database. We requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies and used the related articles feature in PubMed to search for additional studies. We tracked key studies in citation databases such as Science Citation Index and Scopus to ascertain any further relevant studies. We identified ‘grey’ literature, mainly in the form of conference abstracts, through the Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index and Embase. The most recent search for this review was run on the 1 June 2013. Following title and abstract screening of the search results, full‐text papers were obtained for each potentially eligible study. These papers were then independently evaluated for inclusion or exclusion. Selection criteria We included both case‐control and cohort (delayed verification of diagnosis) studies. Where studies used a case‐control design we included all participants who had a clinical diagnosis of FTD or other dementia subtype using standard clinical diagnostic criteria. For cohort studies, we included studies where all participants with suspected dementia were administered rCBF SPECT at baseline. We excluded studies of participants from selected populations (e.g. post‐stroke) and studies of participants with a secondary cause of cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data for the assessment of methodological quality and the investigation of heterogeneity. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool. We produced a narrative summary describing numbers of studies that were found to have high/low/unclear risk of bias as well as concerns regarding applicability. To produce 2 x 2 tables, we dichotomised the rCBF SPECT results (scan positive or negative for FTD) and cross‐tabulated them against the results for the reference standard. These tables were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the index test. Meta‐analysis was not performed due to the considerable between‐study variation in clinical and methodological characteristics. Main results Eleven studies (1117 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These consisted of six case‐control studies, two retrospective cohort studies and three prospective cohort studies. Three studies used single‐headed camera SPECT while the remaining eight used multiple‐headed camera SPECT. Study design and methods varied widely. Overall, participant selection was not well described and the studies were judged as having either high or unclear risk of bias. Often the threshold used to define a positive SPECT result was not predefined and the results were reported with knowledge of the reference standard. Concerns regarding applicability of the studies to the review question were generally low across all three domains (participant selection, index test and reference standard). Sensitivities and specificities for differentiating FTD from non‐FTD ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 and from 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, for the three multiple‐headed camera studies. Sensitivities were lower for the two single‐headed camera studies; one reported a sensitivity and specificity of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), respectively, and the other a sensitivity and specificity of 0.36 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.50) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), respectively. Eight of the 11 studies which used SPECT to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease used multiple‐headed camera SPECT. Of these studies, five used a case‐control design and reported sensitivities of between 0.52 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.41 and 0.86. The remaining three studies used a cohort design and reported sensitivities of between 0.73 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.94 and 1.00. The three studies that used single‐headed camera SPECT reported sensitivities of between 0.40 and 0.80, and specificities of between 0.61 and 0.97. Authors' conclusions At present, we would not recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT in clinical practice because there is insufficient evidence from the available literature to support this. Further research into the use of rCBF SPECT for differentiating FTD from other dementias is required. In particular, protocols should be standardised, study populations should be well described, the threshold for 'abnormal' scans predefined and clear details given on how scans are analysed. More prospective cohort studies that verify the presence or absence of FTD during a period of follow up should be undertaken.","Regional Cerebral Blood Flow SPECT for detection of Frontotemporal dementia in people with suspected dementia Background This review focused on one type of dementia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This neurodegenerative disease affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and accounts for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. People who have this disease may develop changes in their behaviour, speech or ability to plan. It is important to identify people with FTD correctly as the disease course and response to treatment differs from other dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. One test used by healthcare professionals to help make a diagnosis of FTD, is regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography (rCBF SPECT). This investigation allows visualisation of blood flow within the brain. In FTD it is thought that the pattern of blood flow to the brain can be used to tell the difference between FTD and other dementias. However, it is not clear whether using rCBF SPECT in this way improves our ability to make an accurate diagnosis of FTD. As all investigations come with a financial cost, it is important that their benefit is known. Aim:  This review assessed the evidence regarding the accuracy of rCBF SPECT in detecting FTD in people with suspected dementia. Study characteristics We searched many databases for all papers with FTD and rCBF SPECT as their focus. These papers were reviewed independently by several researchers. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eleven studies including 299 individuals with FTD were available for this review. The studies were published over a 21‐year period, with a study size ranging from 27 to 363 participants, mainly recruited from University clinics, tertiary referral centres or memory clinics. Of the 11 studies, three used single‐headed (single detector) gamma cameras, a method no longer used in clinical practice today. Evidence is current to June 2013. Quality of the evidence The majority of studies were at high risk of bias due to insufficient details on how participants were selected and how the rCBF SPECT scans were conducted and analysed. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting, variability of study design and a lack of standardisation of image interpretation between centres. Key findings Due to small study numbers and large variation in how the studies were carried out, we are unable at present to recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in clinical practice.",CD010896
"Background Maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy may have adverse effects on fetal, neonatal and maternal outcomes. Objectives This review investigates the effects of restricting caffeine intake by mothers on fetal, neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (16 January 2015), scanned bibliographies of published studies and corresponded with investigators. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including quasi‐RCTs investigating the effect of caffeine and/or supplementary caffeine versus restricted caffeine intake or placebo on pregnancy outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data for the prespecified outcomes. Caffeinated instant coffee (568 women) was compared with decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women) and it was found that reducing the caffeine intake of regular coffee drinkers (3+ cups/day) during the second and third trimester by an average of 182 mg/day did not affect birthweight (g) (mean difference (MD) 20.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐48.68 to 88.68; one study, 1197 participants;  low quality evidence ), preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.37; one study, 1153 participants;  low quality evidence ) or small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% 0.57 to 1.64; one study, 1150 participants). Risk of bias was moderate in both studies. Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes (birthweight and preterm birth) was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data. Neither of the studies reported on any of the other primary outcomes (low birthweight; first trimester fetal loss; perinatal mortality; fetal hypoxia; fetal tachycardia) or on any of the reviews neonatal or maternal outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of caffeine avoidance on birthweight or other pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to conduct high‐quality, double‐blinded RCTs to determine whether caffeine has any effect on pregnancy outcome.","Effects of restricted caffeine intake by mother on fetal, neonatal and pregnancy outcomes Caffeine is a stimulant found in tea, coffee, cola, chocolate and some over‐the‐counter medicines. Conflicting results found in the literature make it difficult for health professionals to advise pregnant women about avoiding caffeine during pregnancy. Clearance of caffeine from the mother's blood slows down during pregnancy. Some authors of observational studies have concluded that caffeine intake is harmful to the fetus, causing growth restriction, reduced birthweight, preterm birth or stillbirth. The newborn could also have withdrawal symptoms if the mother has a high intake of caffeine (more than eight cups of coffee per day). Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data to the outcomes of interest. The study was based in Denmark. Women less than 20 weeks pregnant were randomly assigned to drinking caffeinated instant coffee (568 women after exclusions) or decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women). Drinking three cups of coffee a day in early pregnancy had no effect on birthweight, preterm births or growth restriction. Both included studies were randomised controlled trials. One randomly allocated pregnant women to either caffeinated or decaffeinated groups. It was unclear from the other whether allocation concealment was undertaken. Blinding of personnel and study participants was satisfactory in both studies while blinding of outcome assessor was not clearly stated. Attrition bias was also not clearly explained in one study. The results from the one trial that provided data for analysis showed that there was no evidence of an effect of caffeine avoidance on the outcomes birthweight, preterm birth or small‐for‐gestational age. Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes, namely birthweight and frequency of preterm birth, was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due in part to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data. There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of caffeine avoidance on birthweight or other pregnancy outcomes.",CD006965
"Background Social skills programmes (SSP) are treatment strategies aimed at enhancing the social performance and reducing the distress and difficulty experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and can be incorporated as part of the rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. Objectives The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social skills training programmes, compared to standard care, for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (November 2006 and December 2011) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. A further search for studies has been conducted by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2015, 37 citations have been found and are currently being assessed by review authors. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials for social skills programmes versus standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. Main results We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group. We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79,  very low quality evidence ), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93,  very low quality evidence ) and participants’ mental state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD ‐4.01 CI ‐7.52 to ‐0.50,  very low quality evidence ) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes. Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68,  very low quality evidence ). Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD ‐7.60 CI ‐12.18 to ‐3.02,  very low quality evidence ). However, when social skills programmes were compared to a discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was  very low . Authors' conclusions Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality. When social skills training was compared to discussion there was no difference on patients outcomes. Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.","Social skills programmes for people with schizophrenia Social skills programmes (SSP) use behavioural therapy and techniques for teaching individuals to communicate their emotions and requests. This means they are more likely to achieve their goals, meet their needs for relationships and for independent living as well as getting on with other people and socially adjusting. Social skills programmes involve 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced to improve general 'molecular' skills (eye contact, fluency of speech, gestures) and 'molar' skills (managing negative emotions, giving positive feedback). Social skills programmes enhance social performance and reduce the distress and difficulty experienced by people with schizophrenia. Social skills programmes can be incorporated as part of a rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975 participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life. Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates. However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.

"Background Gestational weight gain is positively associated with fetal growth, and observational studies of food supplementation in pregnancy have reported increases in gestational weight gain and fetal growth. Objectives To assess the effects of education during pregnancy to increase energy and protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, on energy and protein intake, and the effect on maternal and infant health outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015), reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of dietary education to increase energy and protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data and checked for accuracy. Extracted data were supplemented by additional information from the trialists we contacted. Main results We examined 149 reports corresponding to 65 trials. Of these trials, 17 were included, 46 were excluded, and two are ongoing. Overall, 17 trials involving 9030 women were included. For this update, we assessed methodological quality of the included trials using the standard Cochrane criteria (risk of bias) and the GRADE approach. The overall risk of bias was unclear. Nutritional education (five trials, 1090 women) Women given nutritional education had a lower relative risk of having a preterm birth (two trials, 449 women) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98,  low‐quality evidence ), and low birthweight (one trial, 300 women) (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14). Head circumference at birth was increased in one trial (389 women) (mean difference (MD) 0.99 cm, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.55), while birthweight was significantly increased among undernourished women in two trials (320 women) (MD 489.76 g, 95% CI 427.93 to 551.59,  low‐quality evidence ), but did not significantly increase for adequately nourished women (MD 15.00, 95% CI ‐76.30 to 106.30, one trial, 406 women). Protein intake increased significantly (three trials, 632 women) (protein intake: MD +6.99 g/day, 95% CI 3.02 to 10.97). No significant differences were observed on any other outcomes such as neonatal death (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.72, one trial, 448 women,  low‐quality evidence ), stillbirth (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.90, one trial, 431 women,  low‐quality evidence ), small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.11, one trial, 404 women,  low‐quality evidence ) and total gestational weight gain (MD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐4.41 to 3.59, two trials, 233 women). There were no data on perinatal death. Balanced energy and protein supplementation (12 trials, 6705 women) Risk of stillbirth was significantly reduced for women given balanced energy and protein supplementation (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, five trials, 3408 women,  moderate‐quality evidence ), and the mean birthweight was significantly increased (random‐effects MD +40.96 g, 95% CI 4.66 to 77.26, Tau² = 1744, I² = 44%, 11 trials, 5385 women,  moderate‐quality evidence ). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of small‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90, I² = 16%, seven trials, 4408 women,  moderate‐quality evidence ). No significant effect was detected for preterm birth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16, five trials, 3384 women,  moderate‐quality evidence ) or neonatal death (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, five trials, 3381 women,  low‐quality evidence ). Weekly gestational weight gain was not significantly increased (MD 18.63, 95% CI ‐1.81 to 39.07, nine trials, 2391 women,  very low quality evidence ). There were no data reported on perinatal death and low birthweight. High‐protein supplementation (one trial, 1051 women) High‐protein supplementation (one trial, 505 women), was associated with a significantly increased risk of small‐for‐gestational age babies (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.41,  moderate‐quality evidence ). There was no significant effect for stillbirth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.15, one trial, 529 women), neonatal death (RR 2.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 10.36, one trial, 529 women), preterm birth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.56, one trial, 505 women), birthweight (MD ‐73.00, 95% CI ‐171.26 to 25.26, one trial, 504 women) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 4.50, 95% CI ‐33.55 to 42.55, one trial, 486 women,  low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported on perinatal death. Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women) Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women) had no significant effect on birthweight (MD 108.25, 95% CI ‐220.89 to 437.40) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 110.45, 95% CI ‐82.87 to 303.76,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data reported on perinatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal death, small‐for‐gestational age, and preterm birth. Authors' conclusions This review provides encouraging evidence that antenatal nutritional education with the aim of increasing energy and protein intake in the general obstetric population appears to be effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, increasing head circumference at birth, increasing birthweight among undernourished women, and increasing protein intake. There was no evidence of benefit or adverse effect for any other outcome reported. Balanced energy and protein supplementation seems to improve fetal growth, and may reduce the risk of stillbirth and infants born small‐for‐gestational age. High‐protein supplementation does not seem to be beneficial and may be harmful to the fetus. Balanced‐protein supplementation alone had no significant effects on perinatal outcomes. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. The risk of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined in several of the included trials, and the quality of the evidence was low for several important outcomes. Also, as the anthropometric characteristics of the general obstetric population is changing, those developing interventions aimed at altering energy and protein intake should ensure that only those women likely to benefit are included. Large, well‐designed randomised trials are needed to assess the effects of increasing energy and protein intake during pregnancy in women whose intake is below recommended levels.","Antenatal dietary education and supplementation on energy and protein intake in pregnancy to improve infant outcomes What is the issue? Does dietary advice or supplementation to increase energy and protein intake in pregnancy improve outcomes for babies, and are there any adverse effects? Do these interventions impact differently on poorly‐nourished and well‐nourished pregnant women and their infants? Why is this important? During pregnancy, a baby developing inside the womb receives all its nutrition from its mother. Inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy can lead to malnutrition and poor outcomes for the baby. Therefore, advising women on their diet and providing food supplements in pregnancy may help babies to grow and thrive. What evidence did we find This review includes 17 randomised controlled trials, involving 9030 women. The quality of the included trials is low to moderate. We, examined several aspects of dietary advice and supplementation and produced the following four main findings. (1) Providing nutritional advice resulted in an increase in the mother's protein intake, there were fewer babies born too early (two trials involving 449 women) and fewer babies with low birthweight (one trial involving 300 women), One study of 389 women showed increases in some babies birth head circumference (in one trial involving 389 women) There were also more babies with a higher birthweight among undernourished women (two trials involving 320 women). (2) Giving the mothers balanced energy and protein supplements was associated with fewer babies dying during labour (five trials, 3408 women), clear increases in birthweight (11 trials, 5385 women) and fewer babies who were small‐for‐gestational age (seven trials, 4408 women). However, the impact on the long‐term health of the baby was uncertain, including among undernourished women. (3) High‐protein supplementation (one trial involving 1051 women) showed no benefit for women and potential harm for the baby through an increase in the number of babies small for their gestational age at birth. (4) Isocaloric protein supplementations (i.e. balanced supplements in which the protein replaces an equal quantity of other nutrients, e.g. fat and carbohydrate): in birthweight and weekly gestational weight gain, showed no benefit for women or their babies (two trials involving 184 women). What does this mean? Providing nutritional advice or balanced energy and protein supplements to women during pregnancy may be beneficial. However, there is not enough evidence on isocaloric protein supplements which currently appear to be unhelpful and high‐protein supplements may be harmful.",CD000032
"Background Basilar skull fractures predispose patients to meningitis because of the possible direct contact of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx or middle ear with the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has been associated with a greater risk of contracting meningitis. Antibiotics are often given prophylactically, although their role in preventing bacterial meningitis has not been established. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to June week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to June 2014) and LILACS (1982 to June 2014). We also performed an electronic search of meeting proceedings from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (1997 to September 2005) and handsearched the abstracts of meeting proceedings of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (1995, 1999 and 2003). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic versus placebo or no intervention. We also identified non‐RCTs to perform a separate meta‐analysis in order to compare results. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification with trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random‐effects model. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results In this update we did not identify any new trials for inclusion. We included five RCTs with 208 participants in the review and meta‐analysis. We also identified 17 non‐RCTs comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention in patients with basilar skull fractures. Most trials presented insufficient methodological detail. All studies included meningitis in their primary outcome. When we evaluated the five included RCTs, there were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of the frequency of meningitis, all‐cause mortality, meningitis‐related mortality and need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage. There were no reported adverse effects of antibiotic administration, although one of the five RCTs reported an induced change in the posterior nasopharyngeal flora towards potentially more pathogenic organisms resistant to the antibiotic regimen used in prophylaxis. We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the primary outcome in patients with and without CSF leakage. We also completed a meta‐analysis of all the identified controlled non‐RCTs (enrolling a total of 2168 patients), which produced results consistent with the randomised data from the included studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of trials as moderate. Authors' conclusions Currently available evidence from RCTs does not support prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with basilar skull fractures, whether there is evidence of CSF leakage or not. Until more research is available, the effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures cannot be determined because studies published to date are flawed by biases. Large, appropriately designed RCTs are needed.","Antibiotics to prevent infection of the brain coverings (meningitis) in patients with basilar skull fracture Review question Is it beneficial for patients with basilar skull fractures to receive a course of intravenous antibiotics? Background Basilar skull fracture (7% to 15.8% of all skull fractures) places the central nervous system in contact with bacteria from the nose and throat and may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid leakage (occurring in 2% to 20.8% of patients). Blood or watery discharge from the nose or ears, bruising behind the ear or around the eyes, hearing loss, inability to perceive odours or facial asymmetry may lead physicians to the diagnosis of basilar skull fracture. Patients with a basilar skull fracture may develop meningitis and some doctors give antibiotics in an attempt to reduce this risk. Study characteristics This review examined five randomised controlled trials, comprising a total of 208 participants with basilar skull fracture, which compared those who received preventive antibiotic therapy with those who did not receive antibiotics, to establish how many participants developed meningitis. The evidence is current to June 2014. Key results The available data did not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics, as there is no proven benefit of such therapy. There was a possible adverse effect of increased susceptibility to infection with more pathogenic (disease‐causing) organisms. We suggest that research is needed to address this question, as there are too few studies available on this subject and they have overall design shortcomings and small combined numbers of participants studied. Quality of the evidence We ranked the evidence as being of moderate quality because it is based on randomised data, although with some methodological limitations in design that caused us to downgrade the quality of the trials.",CD004884
"Background TNF (tumor necrosis factor)‐alpha inhibitors block a key protein in the inflammatory chain reaction responsible for joint inflammation, pain, and damage in ankylosing spondylitis. Objectives To assess the benefit and harms of adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab (TNF‐alpha inhibitors) in people with ankylosing spondylitis. Search methods We searched the following databases to January 26, 2009: MEDLINE (from 1966); EMBASE (from 1980); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2008, Issue 4); ACP Journal Club; CINAHL (from 1982); and ISI Web of Knowledge (from 1900). We ran updated searches in May 2012, October 2013, and in June 2014 for McMaster PLUS. We searched major regulatory agencies for safety warnings and clinicaltrials.gov for registered trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab to placebo, other drugs or usual care in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, reported in abstract or full‐text. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed search results, risk of bias, and extracted data. We conducted Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta‐analyses using WinBUGS software. To investigate a class‐effect of harms across biologics, we pooled harms data using Review Manager 5. Main results We included twenty‐one, short‐term (24 weeks or less) RCTs with a total of 3308 participants; 18 contributed data to the MTC analysis: adalimumab (4 studies), etanercept (8 studies), golimumab (2 studies), infliximab (3 studies), and one head‐to‐head study (etanercept versus infliximab) which was unblinded and considered at a higher risk of bias. The risk of selection and detection bias was low or unclear for most of the studies. The risk of selective outcome reporting was low for most studies as they reported on outcomes recommended by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society. We found little heterogeneity and no significant inconsistency in the MTC analyses. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Most studies permitted concomitant therapy of stable doses of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids, but allowances varied across studies. Compared with placebo, there was high quality evidence that patients on an anti‐TNF agent were three to four times more likely to achieve an ASAS40 response (assessing spinal pain, function, and inflammation, as measured by the mean of intensity and duration of morning stiffness, and patient global assessment) by six months (adalimumab: risk ratio (RR) 3.53, 95% credible interval (Crl) 2.49 to 4.91; etanercept: RR 3.31, 95% Crl 2.38 to 4.53; golimumab: RR 2.90, 95% Crl 1.90 to 4.23; infliximab: RR 4.07, 95% Crl 2.80 to 5.74, with a 25% to 40% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve an ASAS 40 response ranged from 3 to 5. There was high quality evidence of improvement in physical function on a 0 to 10 scale (adalimumab: mean difference (MD) ‐1.6, 95% Crl ‐2.2 to ‐0.9; etanercept: MD ‐1.1, 95% CrI ‐1.6 to ‐0.6; golimumab: MD ‐1.5, 95% Crl ‐2.3 to ‐0.7; infliximab: MD ‐2.1, 95% Crl ‐2.7 to ‐1.4, with an 11% to 21% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The NNT to achieve the minimally clinically important difference of 0.7 points ranged from 2 to 4. Compared with placebo, there was moderate quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision) that patients on an anti‐TNF agent were more likely to achieve an ASAS partial remission by six months (adalimumab: RR 6.28, 95% Crl 3.13 to 12.78; etanercept: RR 4.24, 95% Crl 2.31 to 8.09; golimumab: RR 5.18, 95% Crl 1.90 to 14.79; infliximab: RR 15.41, 95% Crl 5.09 to 47.98 with a 10% to 44% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The NNT to achieve an ASAS partial remission response ranged from 3 to 11. There was low to moderate level evidence of a greater reduction in spinal inflammation as measured by magnetic resonance imaging though the absolute differences were small and the clinical relevance of the difference was unclear: adalimumab (1 trial; ‐6% (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐12% to 0.05%); 1 trial: 53.6% mean decrease from baseline versus 9.4% mean increase in the placebo group), golimumab (1 trial; ‐2.5%, (95% CI ‐5.6% to ‐0.7%)), and infliximab (1 trial; ‐3% (95% CI ‐4% to ‐2.4%)). Radiographic progression was measured in one trial (N = 60) of etanercept versus placebo and it found that radiologic changes were similar in both groups (detailed data not provided). There were few events of withdrawals due to adverse events leading to imprecision around the estimates. When all the anti‐TNF agents were combined against placebo, there was moderate quality evidence from 16 studies of an increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse events in the anti‐TNF group (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.44, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.72; total events: 38/1637 in biologic group; 7/986 in placebo) though the absolute increase in harm was small (1%; 95% CI 0% to 2%). Due to low event rates, evidence of the effect of individual TNF‐inhibitors against placebo or for all four biologics pooled together versus placebo on serious adverse events is inconclusive (moderate quality; downgraded for imprecision). For all anti‐TNF pooled versus placebo based on 16 studies: Peto OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.48; 51/1530 in biologic group; 18/878 in placebo; absolute difference: 1% (95% CI 0% to 2%). Using indirect comparison methodology, and one head‐to‐head study of etanercept versus infliximab, wide confidence intervals meant that results were inconclusive for evidence of differences in the major outcomes between different anti‐TNF agents. Regulatory agencies have published warnings about rare adverse events of serious infections, including tuberculosis, malignancies and lymphoma. Authors' conclusions There is moderate to high quality evidence that anti‐TNF agents improve clinical symptoms in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. More participants withdrew due to adverse events when on an anti‐TNF agent but we did not find evidence of an increase in serious adverse events, though event rates were low and trials had a short duration. The short‐term toxicity profile appears acceptable. Based on indirect comparison methodology, we are uncertain whether there are differences between anti‐TNF agents in terms of the key benefit or harm outcomes.","Anti‐TNF‐alpha drugs for treating ankylosing spondylitis Researchers looked at trials done up to June 2014 on the effect of anti‐TNF drugs (adalimumab (Humira®), etanercept (Enbrel®), golimumab (Simponi®), and infliximab (Remicade®)) on ankylosing spondylitis. They found 21 trials with 3308 participants. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. What is ankylosing spondylitis and what are anti‐TNF drugs? Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis, usually in the joints and ligaments of the spine, but it may also affect other joints. Pain and stiffness occurs and limits movement in the back and affected joints. It can come and go, last for long periods, and be quite severe. Anti‐TNF drugs target a protein called 'tumor necrosis factor' that causes inflammation. These drugs suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation in the joints, with the aim of preventing damage. Even though suppressing the immune system can make it slightly harder to fight off infections, it also helps to stabilize an overactive immune system. The review shows that in people with ankylosing spondylitis, using anti‐TNF drugs for up to 24 weeks: ‐ improves pain, function and other symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis;  ‐ may increase the chance of achieving partial remission of symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis;  ‐ probably slightly improves spinal inflammation, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and  ‐ probably causes slightly more people to drop out of studies because of side effects. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, but in these short‐term studies there was no evidence of an increase in serious adverse events. Possible side effects may include a serious infection (like tuberculosis) or upper respiratory infection.  Rare complications may include certain types of cancer.  Best estimate of what happens to people with ankylosing spondylitis who take anti‐TNF drugs for up to 24 weeks: ASAS40 (40% improvement in pain, function, and inflammation as measured by morning stiffness, and patient overall well‐being)     Compared to 13 people out of 100 who experienced an improvement with a placebo, among people who took: ‐ adalimumab: 46 people out of 100 experienced improvement (33% improvement);  ‐ etanercept: 43 people out of 100 experienced improvement (30% improvement);  ‐ golimumab: 38 people out of 100 experienced improvement (25% improvement); and  ‐ infliximab: 53 people out of 100 experienced improvement (40% improvement). Partial remission (defined as a value of less than 2 on a 0 to 10 scale in each of pain, function, and inflammation as measured by morning stiffness, and patient overall well‐being)     Compared to 3 people out of 100 who experienced an improvement with a placebo, among people who took: ‐ adalimumab: 19 people out of 100 experienced partial remission (16% improvement);  ‐ etanercept: 13 people out of 100 experienced partial remission (10% improvement);  ‐ golimumab: 16 people out of 100 experienced partial remission (13% improvement); and  ‐ infliximab: 47 people out of 100 experienced partial remission (44% improvement). Physical function (lower score means better function; 0 to 10 scale) Compared to a score of 5 in people who took placebo, among people who took: ‐ adalimumab, they rated their function to be 3.4 (16% improvement);  ‐ etanercept, they rated their function to be 3.9 (11% improvement);  ‐ golimumab, they rated their function to be 3.5 (15% improvement); and  ‐ infliximab, they rated their function to be 2.9 (21% improvement). Spinal inflammation as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)       Compared to people who took placebo, a small improvement in spinal inflammation was seen in: ‐ adalimumab (6% improvement);  ‐ golimumab (2.5% improvement); and  ‐ infliximab (3% improvement). X‐rays of the joints Only one study looked at x‐rays and found that joint changes were similar in both groups (detailed data not provided). Side effects When all the anti‐TNF drugs were combined, 16 people out of 1000 dropped out of the study because of side effects compared to 7 people out of 1000 who took placebo (absolute increase 1%). There may be little or no difference in the number of people who have a serious side effect with an anti‐TNF drug compared to people who take a fake pill.",CD005468
"Background Mind‐body interventions are based on the holistic principle that mind, body and behaviour are all interconnected. Mind‐body interventions incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well‐being, aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment, and promote people's ability to cope. Mind‐body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to help manage their symptoms and improve well‐being. Examples of mind‐body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation strategies. Objectives To review the benefits and harms of mind‐body therapies in comparison to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, post‐intervention and at three and six month follow‐up. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO) and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Searches of reference lists were conducted and authors in the field were contacted to identify additional relevant articles. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mind‐body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and assessed trials for low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any discrepancy was resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean difference (MD) where the same outcome measure and scoring method was used and standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures were used. For binary data standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used. Main results Seventy‐four papers describing 61 trials were identified, with 4234 predominantly female participants. The nature of fibromyalgia varied from mild to severe across the study populations. Twenty‐six studies were classified as having a low risk of bias for all domains assessed. The findings of mind‐body therapies compared with usual care were prioritised. There is low quality evidence that in comparison to usual care controls psychological therapies have favourable effects on physical functioning (SMD ‐0.4, 95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.3, ‐7.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD ‐0.3, 95% CI ‐0.5 to ‐0.2, ‐3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale) and mood (SMD ‐0.5, 95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.3, ‐4.8% absolute change, 3 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale). There is very low quality evidence of more withdrawals in the psychological therapy group in comparison to usual care controls (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, 6% absolute risk difference). There is lack of evidence of a difference between the number of adverse events in the psychological therapy and control groups (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.50, 4% absolute risk difference). There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback in comparison to usual care controls had an effect on physical functioning (SMD ‐0.1, 95% CI ‐0.4 to 0.3, ‐1.2% absolute change, 1 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD ‐2.6, 95% CI ‐91.3 to 86.1, ‐2.6% absolute change) and mood (SMD 0.1, 95% CI ‐0.3 to 0.5, 1.9% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 90 scale) post‐intervention. In view of the quality of evidence we cannot be certain that biofeedback has a little or no effect on these outcomes. There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback led to more withdrawals from the study (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.43 to 11.62, 20% absolute risk difference). No adverse events were reported. There was no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison to usual care for physical functioning (SMD ‐0.3, 95% CI ‐0.6 to 0.1, ‐4.8% absolute change, 4 point shift on a scale 0 to 100), pain (SMD ‐0.1, CI ‐0.4 to 0.3, ‐1.3% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 10 scale), mood (SMD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.0, ‐3.7% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale) or withdrawals (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.72, 2% absolute risk difference) between the two groups post‐intervention. However, the quality of the evidence was very low for pain and moderate for mood and number of withdrawals. No studies reported any adverse events. Very low quality evidence revealed that movement therapies in comparison to usual care controls improved pain (MD ‐2.3, CI ‐4.2 to ‐0.4, ‐23% absolute change) and mood (MD ‐9.8, 95% CI ‐18.5 to ‐1.2, ‐16.4% absolute change) post‐intervention. There was no advantage for physical functioning (SMD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.2, ‐3.4% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), participant withdrawals (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.38, 11% absolute difference) or adverse events (RR 4.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 93.92, 4% absolute risk difference) between the two groups, however rare adverse events may include worsening of pain. Low quality evidence revealed that relaxation based therapies in comparison to usual care controls showed an advantage for physical functioning (MD ‐8.3, 95% CI ‐10.1 to ‐6.5, ‐10.4% absolute change) and pain (SMD ‐1.0, 95% CI ‐1.6 to ‐0.5, ‐3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 78 scale) but not for mood (SMD ‐4.4, CI ‐14.5 to 5.6, ‐7.4% absolute change) post‐intervention. There was no difference between the groups for number of withdrawals (RR 4.40, 95% CI 0.59 to 33.07, 31% absolute risk difference) and no adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions Psychological interventions therapies may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison to usual care controls but the quality of the evidence is low. Further research on the outcomes of therapies is needed to determine if positive effects identified post‐intervention are sustained. The effectiveness of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation based therapies remains unclear as the quality of the evidence was very low or low. The small number of trials and inconsistency in the use of outcome measures across the trials restricted the analysis.","Interventions focusing on the link between the mind and body for adults with fibromyalgia Research question What are the effects of mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia on pain, physical function, mood and side effects? What problems does fibromyalgia cause?   People with fibromyalgia have chronic, widespread body pain, and often have fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression and problems sleeping. What are mind‐body interventions? Mind‐body interventions include treatments such as biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies, psychological therapy and relaxation therapies. Biofeedback is when you are connected to electrical sensors that help you receive information about your body to make subtle changes in your body, such as relaxing. Mindfulness means having awareness of thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. All mind‐body therapies make the link between thoughts, behaviour and feelings to help people to cope with their symptoms. Study characteristics We conducted a review of the effect of mind‐body therapies for adults with fibromyalgia. After searching for all relevant studies until October 2013, we found 61 studies including 4234 adults. ‐ Many studies only included female participants, but some males were included in a few studies.  ‐ Participants had mild to severe fibromyalgia.  ‐ Mind‐body interventions were compared to 'usual care', such as medication use. Secondary analysis also compared findings in comparison to an 'attention control therapy' which involved receiving information for the same amount of time as the mind‐body therapy. Key results at the end of treatment ‐ Low quality evidence revealed that psychological therapies improved physical functioning, pain, mood and side effects compared to usual care. More people withdrew from the psychological therapy group compared to usual care. ‐ There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain and mood between people receiving biofeedback and usual care but this may have happened by chance. More people withdrew from the biofeedback than the usual care group. No studies reported any side effects. ‐ There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain, mood and the number of withdrawals between people receiving mindfulness therapy and usual care. No studies reported any adverse events. ‐ We are uncertain whether movement therapies improve physical functioning, pain, mood, side effects or the number of people who withdrew from the treatment. There were improvements in pain and mood for people receiving movement therapies but the quality of the evidence was very low. More people withdrew and two participants reported experiencing increased pain in the intervention group. ‐ We are uncertain whether relaxation therapies improve physical functioning and pain compared to usual care because the quality of evidence was very low. There was little or no difference in mood and withdrawal from treatment between people receiving relaxation therapies and those receiving usual care. No adverse events were reported. Best estimates of what happens at the end of treatment in people with fibromyalgia when they use mind‐body therapies The main findings on the use of psychological therapies are summarised below. ‐ Physical functioning after 1 to 25 weeks (higher scores mean greater limitations) People who used psychological therapies rated their physical functioning as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (7.5% absolute improvement). ‐ Pain after 3 to 14 weeks (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) People who used psychological therapies rated their pain as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (3.5% absolute improvement). ‐ Mood (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) People who used psychological therapies rated their mood as 3 points lower on a scale of 20 to 80 compared to those who received usual care (4.8% absolute improvement). ‐ Withdrawing from the treatment for any reason A total of 204 out of 1000 people withdrew from psychological therapies compared with 148 out of 1000 from usual care (6% absolute improvement). ‐ Side effects Nineteen people out of 1000 who received psychological therapies experienced a side effect compared with 51 out of 1000 who had usual care (4% absolute improvement). This may have happened by chance. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of mind‐body therapies. Rare adverse events may include worsening of pain.",CD001980
"Background The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work‐related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational‐level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work‐related stress in teachers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and controlled before‐and‐after studies of organisational‐level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster‐randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped‐wedge design. Changing task characteristics One study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task‐based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from ‐3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low‐quality evidence). Changing organisational characteristics Two studies compared teacher training combined with school‐wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job‐related anxiety (MD ‐0.25 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.11, very low‐quality evidence) or depression (MD ‐0.26 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.05, very low‐quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD ‐0.05 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.42, low‐quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.33, low‐quality evidence) after six months. Multi‐component intervention One study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi‐component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched‐comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow‐up, very low‐quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias. Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex‐interventions framework, use a cluster‐randomised design and have large sample sizes.","Work changes to prevent and decrease stress in teachers Background Teachers often experience stress at work, which can lead to physical and mental health problems, increased sickness absence, teacher resignations, and decline in children's performance and health. Individual stress management and counselling programmes directed at teachers only target stress symptoms, while interventions directed at the school organisation target the causes of stress. We searched for studies until January 2015 to assess the evidence on work changes to improve wellbeing and reduce work‐related stress in teachers. Study Characteristics We found four studies that included a total of 2199 teachers. They evaluated three types of work changes. One intervention consisted of changes in teachers' tasks such as redesigning work, establishing flexible work schedules and redesigning the work environment. Another intervention consisted of a school‐wide coaching support network alongside individual training for teachers, in order to deliver a child development programme. The third intervention consisted of several components: performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. Results Changes in tasks of teachers In one study with 961 teachers in eight schools, changes in tasks of teachers combined with stress management training resulted in a small reduction in work stress levels after one year follow‐up compared to no intervention. There was also a small increase in work ability, meaning how well a worker is able to perform his or her work. However, the authors did not report how they changed teachers' tasks, limiting the results' usefulness elsewhere. Changing organisational features There were two studies of school‐wide coaching support combined with teacher training. In one study with 43 schools and 59 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on anxiety or depression after two years follow‐up compared to no intervention. In the other study with 18 schools and 77 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on burnout or emotional ability after six months follow‐up compared to no intervention. Burnout is a state of prolonged severe stress. Emotional ability means understanding other people’s emotions, and understanding and controlling ones own emotions. Both studies had a small number of participants. Multicomponent programme In one study with 34 schools and 1102 teachers, the intervention included performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. After three years follow‐up and compared to 300 similar schools, there was a moderate reduction in resignation of teachers in the intervention schools. However, authors reported results only for eight schools. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low for all interventions because the authors did not report all the results and lost many participants for follow‐up. All included studies also had interventions directed at individual teachers combined with changes at schools. Therefore, new and better quality studies directed at schools will probably change the conclusions of this review. Conclusion Changing the way teachers' work is organised at schools may improve the teachers' wellbeing and may reduce teacher resignations. We need better‐designed research in the development and testing of work changes in schools. In future studies, whether work at schools is changed or not should be determined according to chance. These studies should also have several hundred participants.",CD010306
"Background Management of breech presentation is controversial, particularly in regard to manipulation of the position of the fetus by external cephalic version (ECV). ECV may reduce the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but there also have been reports of complications with the procedure. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of ECV at or near term on measures of pregnancy outcome. Methods of facilitating ECV, and ECV before term are reviewed separately. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (28 February 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised trials of ECV at or near term (with or without tocolysis) compared with no attempt at ECV in women with breech presentation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted the data. Main results We included eight studies, with a total of 1308 women randomised. The pooled data from these studies show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non‐cephalic presentation at birth (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.61, eight trials, 1305 women); vaginal cephalic birth not achieved (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62, seven trials, 1253 women, evidence graded very low); and caesarean section (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.82, eight trials, 1305 women, evidence graded very low) when ECV was attempted in comparison to no ECV attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings below seven at one minute (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.37, three trials, 168 infants) or five minutes (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.36, five trials, 428 infants, evidence graded very low), low umbilical vein pH levels (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.44, one trial, 52 infants, evidence graded very low), neonatal admission (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.34, four trials, 368 infants, evidence graded very low), perinatal death (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64, eight trials, 1305 infants, evidence graded low), nor time from enrolment to delivery (mean difference ‐0.25 days, 95% CI ‐2.81 to 2.31, two trials, 256 women). All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the level of evidence was graded low or very low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in several studies. Three of the eight trials had serious design limitations, however excluding these studies in a sensitivity analysis for outcomes with substantial heterogeneity did not alter the results. Authors' conclusions Attempting cephalic version at term reduces the chance of non‐cephalic presentation at birth, vaginal cephalic birth not achieved and caesarean section. There is not enough evidence from randomised trials to assess complications of ECV at term. Large observational studies suggest that complications are rare. A visual summary of some of the results from this review can be found  here.","Effects of turning unborn babies from bottom first to head first at the end of pregnancy (around 36 weeks or more) for reducing problems during childbirth What is the issue? The best outcomes in childbirth for both mothers and babies are when the baby is born head‐first. If the baby is in another position, there is a higher risk of complications including the need for caesarean section. In a ‘breech presentation’ the baby is bottom‐down instead of head‐down. External cephalic version (ECV) is a technique for turning the unborn baby so it lies head‐down. This review looked at the effects of using ECV on babies that were in the breech position at the end of pregnancy (around 36 weeks or more). Why is this important? Everyone wants to avoid complications in childbirth and many women want to avoid having a caesarean section. Avoiding the need for surgery is very important in countries with limited resources for healthcare. ECV is sometimes used before the end of pregnancy (around 34 weeks) but the results might be different when it is used just before childbirth. Also, it might not be possible to turn the unborn baby at this late stage. We wanted to know if using ECV at the end of pregnancy resulted in safer childbirth or was harmful. What evidence did we find? We found 8 studies involving 1308 women. (We included studies up to 28 February 2015.) All the studies were randomised and involved women with low‐risk pregnancies. Using ECV around 36 weeks or more increased the chance that babies were born head‐first and reduced the risk of having a caesarean section. There were no clear differences in other outcomes such as the risk of babies dying. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was varied. What does this mean? If an unborn baby is lying bottom‐down, turning it by ECV just before birth can reduce some of the problems this position can cause. These studies are too small to show if ECV is safe to use in women with low‐risk pregnancies, however other types of studies suggest that it is safe. We also do not know if it should be used in high‐risk cases, such as mothers who have already had a caesarean section, or who are expecting twins. A visual summary of some of the results from this review can be found  here.",CD000083
"Background Under‐reporting of occupational diseases is an important issue worldwide. The collection of reliable data is essential for public health officials to plan intervention programmes to prevent occupational diseases. Little is known about the effects of interventions for increasing the reporting of occupational diseases. Objectives To evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Occupational Safety and Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, OSH UPDATE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenSIGLE, and Health Evidence until January 2015. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted study authors to identify additional published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs), controlled before‐after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) of the effects of increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. The primary outcome was the reporting of occupational diseases measured as the number of physicians reporting or as the rate of reporting occupational diseases. Data collection and analysis Pairs of authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We expressed intervention effects as risk ratios or rate ratios. We combined the results of similar studies in a meta‐analysis. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each combination of intervention and outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included seven RCTs and five CBA studies. Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of educational materials alone, one study evaluated educational meetings, four studies evaluated a combination of the two, and one study evaluated a multifaceted educational campaign for increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. We judged all the included studies to have a high risk of bias. We did not find any studies evaluating the effectiveness of Internet‐based interventions or interventions on procedures or techniques of reporting, or the use of financial incentives. Moreover, we did not find any studies evaluating large‐scale interventions like the introduction of new laws, existing or new specific disease registries, newly established occupational health services, or surveillance systems. Educational materials We found moderate‐quality evidence that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases compared to no intervention (risk ratio of 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.67). We also found moderate‐quality evidence showing that sending a reminder message of a legal obligation to report increased the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases (risk ratio of 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66) when compared to a reminder message about the benefits of reporting. We found low‐quality evidence that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the rate of reporting when compared to no intervention. Educational materials plus meetings We found moderate‐quality evidence that the use of educational materials combined with meetings did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting when compared to no intervention (risk ratio of 1.22, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.81). We found low‐quality evidence that educational materials plus meetings did not considerably increase the rate of reporting when compared to no intervention (rate ratio of 0.77, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.41). Educational meetings We found very low‐quality evidence showing that educational meetings increased the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases (risk ratio at baseline: 0.82, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.41 and at follow‐up: 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.74) when compared to no intervention. We found very low‐quality evidence that educational meetings did not considerably increase the rate of reporting occupational diseases when compared to no intervention (rate ratio at baseline: 1.57, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.02 and at follow‐up: 1.92, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.47). Educational campaign We found very low‐quality evidence showing that the use of an educational campaign increased the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases when compared to no intervention (risk ratio at baseline: 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.50 and at follow‐up: 11.59, 95% CI 5.97 to 22.49). Authors' conclusions We found 12 studies to include in this review. They provide evidence ranging from very low to moderate quality showing that educational materials, educational meetings, or a combination of the two do not considerably increase the reporting of occupational diseases. The use of a reminder message on the legal obligation to report might provide some positive results. We need high‐quality RCTs to corroborate these findings. Future studies should investigate the effects of large‐scale interventions like legislation, existing or new disease‐specific registries, newly established occupational health services, or surveillance systems. When randomisation or the identification of a control group is impractical, these large‐scale interventions should be evaluated using an interrupted time‐series design. We also need studies assessing online reporting and interventions aimed at simplifying procedures or techniques of reporting and the use of financial incentives.","Interventions to increase the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians Background There are many diseases that are caused by work. For example, miners often suffer from lung diseases like pneumoconiosis, whereas eczema is common in hairdressing. Both are commonly referred to as occupational diseases. For workers to receive compensation, therapy or prevention for having developed symptoms because of work, a physician has to officially recognise their condition as an occupational diseases and report it to the appropriate authorities. However, often occupational diseases go unreported. This is because doctors might not know what is expected of them or they feel reporting is too difficult and takes too much time. Because of under‐reporting, occupational disease figures are often not reliable even within a given country. Not knowing the size of the problem, public health officials cannot plan intervention programmes or allocate resources. Many projects have been set up in various countries to improve the reporting of mostly specific categories of occupational diseases. Review question What are the effects of interventions aimed at increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians? Study characteristics We included 12 studies. Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of educational materials alone; one study evaluated the effectiveness of educational meetings; and four studies evaluated a combination of the two in increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians. A further study evaluated the effectiveness of a complex educational campaign acting at society level. We searched for studies until January 2015. Results We found that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases, but a legal obligation reminder message did. Furthermore, we found that the use of educational materials did not considerably increase the rate of reporting occupational diseases. Similarly, we found that the use of both educational materials and meetings did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases or the rate of reporting. The same holds for the use of educational meetings alone. The use of an educational campaign appeared to increase the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases, although this was based on very low‐quality evidence. Further research We need high‐quality studies to clarify the effectiveness of these interventions. This review was unable to determine the effectiveness of interventions other than education like the use of financial incentives, which could be an important form of motivation in changing physicians' behaviour. Such small‐scale interventions could be investigated using larger randomised controlled trials, while the evaluation of large‐scale interventions like legislation should use an interrupted time‐series design.",CD010305
"Background Children with developmental speech sound disorders have difficulties in producing the speech sounds of their native language. These speech difficulties could be due to structural, sensory or neurophysiological causes (e.g. hearing impairment), but more often the cause of the problem is unknown. One treatment approach used by speech‐language therapists/pathologists is non‐speech oral motor treatment (NSOMT). NSOMTs are non‐speech activities that aim to stimulate or improve speech production and treat specific speech errors. For example, using exercises such as smiling, pursing, blowing into horns, blowing bubbles, and lip massage to target lip mobility for the production of speech sounds involving the lips, such as /p/, /b/, and /m/. The efficacy of this treatment approach is controversial, and evidence regarding the efficacy of NSOMTs needs to be examined. Objectives To assess the efficacy of non‐speech oral motor treatment (NSOMT) in treating children with developmental speech sound disorders who have speech errors. Search methods In April 2014 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (R) and Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO and 11 other databases. We also searched five trial and research registers, checked the reference lists of relevant titles identified by the search and contacted researchers to identify other possible published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared (1) NSOMT versus placebo or control; and (2) NSOMT as adjunctive treatment or speech intervention versus speech intervention alone, for children aged three to 16 years with developmental speech sound disorders, as judged by a speech and language therapist. Individuals with an intellectual disability (e.g. Down syndrome) or a physical disability were not excluded. Data collection and analysis The Trials Search Co‐ordinator of the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group and one review author ran the searches. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to eliminate irrelevant studies, extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias in each of these studies. In cases of ambiguity or information missing from the paper, we contacted trial authors. Main results This review identified three studies (from four reports) involving a total of 22 children that investigated the efficacy of NSOMT as adjunctive treatment to conventional speech intervention versus conventional speech intervention for children with speech sound disorders. One study, a randomised controlled trial (RCT), included four boys aged seven years one month to nine years six months ‐ all had speech sound disorders, and two had additional conditions (one was diagnosed as ""communication impaired"" and the other as ""multiply disabled""). Of the two quasi‐randomised controlled trials, one included 10 children (six boys and four girls), aged five years eight months to six years nine months, with speech sound disorders as a result of tongue thrust, and the other study included eight children (four boys and four girls), aged three to six years, with moderate to severe articulation disorder only. Two studies did not find NSOMT as adjunctive treatment to be more effective than conventional speech intervention alone, as both intervention and control groups made similar improvements in articulation after receiving treatments. One study reported a change in postintervention articulation test results but used an inappropriate statistical test and did not report the results clearly. None of the included studies examined the effects of NSOMTs on any other primary outcomes, such as speech intelligibility, speech physiology and adverse effects, or on any of the secondary outcomes such as listener acceptability. The RCT was judged at low risk for selection bias. The two quasi‐randomised trials used randomisation but did not report the method for generating the random sequence and were judged as having unclear risk of selection bias. The three included studies were deemed to have high risk of performance bias as, given the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants was not possible. Only one study implemented blinding of outcome assessment and was at low risk for detection bias. One study showed high risk of other bias as the baseline characteristics of participants seemed to be unequal. The sample size of each of the included studies was very small, which means it is highly likely that participants in these studies were not representative of its target population. In the light of these serious limitations in methodology, the overall quality of the evidence provided by the included trials is judged to be low. Therefore, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect and is likely to change the estimate. Authors' conclusions The three included studies were small in scale and had a number of serious methodological limitations. In addition, they covered limited types of NSOMTs for treating children with speech sound disorders of unknown origin with the sounds /s/ and /z/. Hence, we judged the overall applicability of the evidence as limited and incomplete. Results of this review are consistent with those of previous reviews: Currently no strong evidence suggests that NSOMTs are an effective treatment or an effective adjunctive treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders. Lack of strong evidence regarding the treatment efficacy of NSOMTs has implications for clinicians when they make decisions in relation to treatment plans. Well‐designed research is needed to carefully investigate NSOMT as a type of treatment for children with speech sound disorders.","Non‐speech oral motor treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effects of non‐speech oral motor treatment (NSOMT) for treating children with developmental speech sound disorders who have speech errors. Background Children with developmental speech sound disorders have difficulties in producing the speech sounds of their own language. These speech difficulties could be due to structural, sensory or neurophysiological causes (e.g. hearing impairment), but more often the cause of the problem is unknown. One treatment approach used by speech and language therapists or pathologists consists of non‐speech oral motor treatments (NSOMTs). NSOMTs are activities that aim to stimulate or improve speech production and treat children with specific speech errors without requiring that the child produce a speech sound. This method of therapy uses exercises, such as smiling, pursing, blowing into horns and blowing bubbles and performing lip massage to target lip mobility for the production of speech sounds involving the lips, such as /p/, /b/ and /m/. Whether NSOMTs are effective for treating children with speech errors is controversial. Therefore, evidence regarding the effects of NSOMTs must be examined. Study characteristics The evidence is current to April 2014. We found three studies (from four reports) involving a total of 22 children aged three to nine years who received a combination of NSOMTs and articulation or phonological therapy (intervention group), or articulation or phonological therapy alone (control group). One study was a randomised controlled trial in which four boys with speech sound disorders were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. In this study, each participant received 16 × 30‐minute individual therapy sessions, twice per week over eight weeks, to treat the speech sound 's'. For the intervention group, NSOMT (oral placement therapy) was conducted in the first 10 minutes of each session, followed by 20‐minute articulation therapy. The other two studies used randomisation, but the method used to generate the random sequence was not reported. In one of these studies, six boys and four girls, all with speech sound disorders due to tongue thrust, were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Each participant received 22 × 30‐minute individual sessions conducted weekly in the first six weeks, and twice a week in the following eight weeks, to treat 's' and 'z' sounds. The intervention group received NSOMT (Hanson's 1977 approach) in the first six weeks and alternating sessions of NSOMT and articulation therapy in the following eight weeks. The final study randomly assigned four boys and four girls with moderate to severe articulation disorder alone to either intervention group or control group. Each participant received 9 × 20‐minute group therapy sessions (two participants in each group), conducted twice a week over five weeks. For the intervention group, NSOMT (oral motor exercises for speech clarity) was conducted during the first 10 minutes of each session. Speech errors associated with the 's' sound were treated for the intervention group; however, the speech sound(s) treated for the control group were not detailed. None of the studies reported funding support. Key results Two studies (one that used oral placement therapy and one that used Hanson's 1977 approach) did not find NSOMT as an adjunctive treatment to be more effective than conventional speech intervention only, as both intervention and control groups had made similar improvements in articulation after treatment (i.e. fewer speech errors or increased percentage of correct articulation). The study that used oral motor exercises for speech clarity as the NSOMT reported a change in articulation test results after treatment, but used an inappropriate statistical test and did not report the results clearly. Quality of the evidence The three included studies were small in scale and had a number of serious methodological limitations. Moreover, these studies covered limited types of NSOMTs for treating just one class of speech sounds ‐ 's' with or without 'z' ‐ in children with speech sound disorders. Hence, the overall applicability of the evidence is limited, and the evidence is believed to be incomplete and of low quality. To conclude, currently no strong evidence indicates whether NSOMTs are effective as treatment or adjunctive treatment for children with developmental speech sound disorders.",CD009383
"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe loss of kidney function that results in patients' inability to appropriately excrete nitrogenous wastes and creatinine. Continuous haemodiafiltration (HDF) or haemofiltration (HF) are commonly used renal replacement therapies for people with AKI. Buffered dialysates and solutions used in HDF or HF have varying effects on acid‐base physiology and several electrolytes. The benefits and harms of bicarbonate‐ versus lactate‐buffered HDF or HF solutions for treating patients with AKI remain unclear. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of bicarbonate‐ versus lactate‐buffered solutions for HDF or HF for treating people with AKI. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‐RCTs that reported comparisons of bicarbonate‐buffered solutions with lactate‐buffered solutions for AKI were selected for inclusion irrespective of publication status or language. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, and where necessary the full text of studies, to determine which satisfied our inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two authors who independently assessed studies for eligibility and quality using a standardised data extraction form. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We identified four studies (171 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. Overall, study quality was suboptimal. There were significant reporting omissions related to methodological issues and potential harms. Outcome measures were not defined or reported adequately. The studies were small and lacked follow‐up phases. Serum lactate levels were significantly lower in patients treated with bicarbonate‐buffered solutions (4 studies, 171 participants: MD ‐1.09 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐1.30 to ‐0.87; I 2  = 0%). There were no differences in mortality (3 studies, 163 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.15; I 2  = 0%); serum bicarbonate levels (3 studies, 163 participants: MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐1.45 to 1.99; I 2  = 78%), serum creatinine (2 studies, 137 participants: MD ‐22.81 µmol/L, 95% CI ‐129.61 to 83.99; I 2  = 73%), serum base excess (3 studies, 145 participants: MD 0.80, 95% CI ‐0.91 to 2.50; I 2  = 38%), serum pH (4 studies, 171 participants: MD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.03; I 2  = 70%) or carbon dioxide partial pressure (3 studies, 151 participants: MD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐3.84 to 1.76; I 2  = 83%). A single study reported fewer cardiovascular events (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79), higher mean arterial pressure (10.25 mm Hg, 95% CI 6.68 to 13.82) and less hypotensive events (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75) in patients receiving bicarbonate‐buffered solutions. One study reported no significant difference in central venous pressure (MD 2.00 cm H 2 O, 95% CI ‐0.7 to, 4.77). Total length of hospital and ICU stay and relapse were not reported by any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions There were no significant different between bicarbonate‐ and lactate‐buffered solutions for mortality, serum bicarbonate levels, serum creatinine, serum base excess, serum pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, central venous pressure and serum electrolytes. Patients treated with bicarbonate‐buffered solutions may experience fewer cardiovascular events, lower serum lactate levels, higher mean arterial pressure and less hypotensive events. With the exception of mortality, we were not able to assess the main primary outcomes of this review ‐ length of time in ICU, total length of hospital stay and relapse.","Bicarbonate‐ versus lactate‐buffered solutions for acute continuous haemodiafiltration or haemofiltration People with acute kidney injury (AKI) have serious loss of kidney function and are unable to rid wastes from the body in urine. People with AKI need dialysis (haemofiltration) which requires use of buffered solutions (dialysates) to rid waste from their blood. Different dialysates can have various effects on the balance of blood chemistry. Maintaining balanced blood chemistry helps to reduce risks of heart, blood circulation and blood pressure problems. We assessed the benefits and harms of bicarbonate‐buffered solutions and lactate‐buffered solutions by analysing results from four randomised controlled studies that together involved 171 participants. The evidence was flawed by study design and reporting problems, and the small number of people in the studies. Based on limited evidence from one study (117 participants), we found that people treated with bicarbonate‐buffered solutions may experience fewer heart and blood circulation problems and high blood pressure events. The studies did not include enough evidence to make recommendations about the use of these solutions.",CD006819
"Background Undernutrition contributes to five million deaths of children under five each year. Furthermore, throughout the life cycle, undernutrition contributes to increased risk of infection, poor cognitive functioning, chronic disease, and mortality. It is thus important for decision‐makers to have evidence about the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for young children. Objectives Primary objective 1. To assess the effectiveness of supplementary feeding interventions, alone or with co‐intervention, for improving the physical and psychosocial health of disadvantaged children aged three months to five years. Secondary objectives 1. To assess the potential of such programmes to reduce socio‐economic inequalities in undernutrition.  2. To evaluate implementation and to understand how this may impact on outcomes.  3. To determine whether there are any adverse effects of supplementary feeding. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and seven other databases for all available years up to January 2014. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and several sources of grey literature. In addition, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, and asked experts in the area about ongoing and unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) that provided supplementary food (with or without co‐intervention) to children aged three months to five years, from all countries. Adjunctive treatments, such as nutrition education, were allowed. Controls had to be untreated. Data collection and analysis Two or more review authors independently reviewed searches, selected studies for inclusion or exclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We conducted meta‐analyses for continuous data using the mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), correcting for clustering if necessary. We analysed studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries and from high‐income countries separately, and RCTs separately from CBAs. We conducted a process evaluation to understand which factors impact on effectiveness. Main results We included 32 studies (21 RCTs and 11 CBAs); 26 of these (16 RCTs and 10 CBAs) were in meta‐analyses. More than 50% of the RCTs were judged to have low risk of bias for random selection and incomplete outcome assessment. We judged most RCTS to be unclear for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and selective outcome reporting. Because children and parents knew that they were given food, we judged blinding of participants and personnel to be at high risk for all studies. Growth. Supplementary feeding had positive effects on growth in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Meta‐analysis of the RCTs showed that supplemented children gained an average of 0.12 kg more than controls over six months (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.18, 9 trials, 1057 participants, moderate quality evidence). In the CBAs, the effect was similar; 0.24 kg over a year (95% CI 0.09 to 0.39, 1784 participants, very low quality evidence). In high‐income countries, one RCT found no difference in weight, but in a CBA with 116 Aboriginal children in Australia, the effect on weight was 0.95 kg (95% CI 0.58 to 1.33). For height, meta‐analysis of nine RCTs revealed that supplemented children grew an average of 0.27 cm more over six months than those who were not supplemented (95% CI 0.07 to 0.48, 1463 participants, moderate quality evidence). Meta‐analysis of seven CBAs showed no evidence of an effect (mean difference (MD) 0.52 cm, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.10, 7 trials, 1782 participants, very low quality evidence). Meta‐analyses of the RCTs demonstrated benefits for weight‐for‐age z‐scores (WAZ) (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.24, 8 trials, 1565 participants, moderate quality evidence), and height‐for‐age z‐scores (HAZ) (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.24, 9 trials, 4638 participants, moderate quality evidence), but not for weight‐for‐height z‐scores MD 0.10 (95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.22, 7 trials, 4176 participants, moderate quality evidence). Meta‐analyses of the CBAs showed no effects on WAZ, HAZ, or WHZ (very low quality evidence). We found moderate positive effects for haemoglobin (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.91, 5 trials, 300 participants) in a meta‐analysis of the RCTs. Psychosocial outcomes. Eight RCTs in low‐ and middle‐income countries assessed psychosocial outcomes. Our meta‐analysis of two studies showed moderate positive effects of feeding on psychomotor development (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.72, 178 participants). The evidence of effects on cognitive development was sparse and mixed. We found evidence of substantial leakage. When feeding was given at home, children benefited from only 36% of the energy in the supplement. However, when the supplementary food was given in day cares or feeding centres, there was less leakage; children took in 85% of the energy provided in the supplement. Supplementary food was generally more effective for younger children (less than two years of age) and for those who were poorer/ less well‐nourished. Results for sex were equivocal. Our results also suggested that feeding programmes which were given in day‐care/feeding centres and those which provided a moderate‐to‐high proportion of the recommended daily intake (% RDI) for energy were more effective. Authors' conclusions Feeding programmes for young children in low‐ and middle‐income countries can work, but good implementation is key.","Supplementary feeding for children aged three months to five years: does it work to improve their health and well‐being? Background Undernutrition is a cause of child mortality; it contributed to the deaths of more than three million children in 2011. Furthermore, it can lead to higher risk of infection, poorer child development and school performance, and to chronic disease in adulthood. Evidence about the effectiveness of nutrition interventions for young children, therefore, is fundamentally important; not only for governments, funding agencies and nongovernmental organisations, but also for the children themselves. Review question How effective are supplementary food programmes for improving the health of disadvantaged children? What factors contribute to the effectiveness of such programmes? Methods We included studies that compared children who were given supplementary feeding (food, drink) to those who did not receive any feeding. We followed careful systematic review methodology, including the use of broad searches. At least two people were involved in every stage of the review. Where possible, we performed analyses to combine results of several studies and get an average effect. We looked carefully for factors that may have impacted on the results (child age, sex and disadvantage, family sharing food, amount of energy given, etc.). The evidence is current to January 2014. Study characteristics We included 32 studies; 21 randomised controlled trials (in which children were randomly assigned to receive either supplementary feeding (intervention group) or not (a control group), and 11 controlled before‐and‐after studies (in which outcomes were observed before and after treatment in a group of children who were not randomly assigned to an intervention and a control group). The number of children in them ranged from 30 to 3166. Most studies were from low‐ and middle‐income countries; three were from high‐income countries. Key findings We found that, in low‐ and middle‐income countries, providing additional food to children aged three months to five years led to small gains in weight (0.24 kg a year in both RCTs and CBAs) and height (0.54 cm a year in RCTs only; no evidence of an effect in other study designs),and moderate increases in haemoglobin. We also found positive impacts on psychomotor development (skills that involve mental and muscular activity). We found mixed evidence on effects of supplementary feeding on mental development. In high‐income countries, two studies found no benefits for growth. The one effective study involved Aboriginal children. We found that food was often redistributed ('leakage') within the family; when feeding was home‐delivered, children benefited from only 36% of the energy given in the supplement. However, when the supplementary food was given in day care centres or feeding centres, there was much less leakage; children took in 85% of the energy provided in the supplement. When we looked at different groups supplementary food was more effective for younger children (under two years old) and for those who were poorer or less well‐nourished. Results for sex were mixed. Feeding programmes that were well‐supervised and those that provided a greater proportion of required daily food for energy were generally more effective. Quality of the evidence We judged evidence from the RCTs to be of moderate quality and evidence from the CBAs to be of low quality.",CD009924
"Background Diabetic cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is a condition which involves fluid accumulation in the inner portion of the retina. It often follows changes in retinal blood vessels which enhance the fluid to come out of vessels. Although it may be asymptomatic, symptoms are primarily painless loss of central vision, often with the complaint of seeing black spots in front of the eye. It is reported that CMO may resolve spontaneously, or fluctuate for months, before causing loss of vision. If left untreated or undiagnosed, progression of CMO may lead to permanent visual loss. It has been noted that patients with diabetic retinopathy have elevated inflammatory markers, and therefore it is likely that inflammation aids in the progression of vascular disease in these patients. Several topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ketorolac 0.5%, bromfenac 0.09%, and nepafenac 0.1%, have therefore also been used topically to treat chronic diabetic CMO. Hence this review was conducted to find out the effects of topical NSAIDs in diabetic CMO. Objectives To assess the effects of topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for diabetic cystoid macular oedema (CMO). Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2015), the ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 January 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs investigating the effects of topically applied NSAIDs in the treatment of people with diabetic CMO aged 18 years of age or over. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and screened all available titles and abstracts for inclusion. There were no discrepancies and we did not have to contact trial investigators for missing data. Main results We did not identify any RCTs matching the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions The review did not identify any RCTs investigating the effects of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of diabetic CMO. Most of the studies identified through the electronic searches had been conducted to analyse the effect of topical NSAIDs for pseudophakic CMO.In the absence of high quality evidence, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement and other low level evidence, such as observational non‐randomised trials, to decide whether to use topical NSAIDs in cases of diabetic CMO. More research is needed to better understand the cause of this condition and its pathophysiology. This systematic review has identified the need for well designed, adequately powered RCTs to assess possible beneficial and adverse effects of topical NSAIDs in people with diabetic CMO. Future trials should aim to include a large sample size with an adequate follow‐up period of up to one year.","Topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents for diabetic cystoid macular oedema Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for diabetic cystoid macular oedema. Background  Diabetic retinopathy is a frequent cause of blindness in adults aged between 20 and 74 years. The major cause of vision impairment in those with diabetic retinopathy is the accumulation of fluid in the central part of the retina (macula) known as cystoid macular oedema (CMO). CMO is the chronic and diffuse variety of diabetic macular oedema (DMO).The use of topical anti‐inflammatory agents has been suggested as a potential treatment for diabetic CMO. We aimed to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (these are clinical research studies, which give good quality evidence on the effects of interventions) that investigated the effects of various topically applied non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in treating diabetic CMO, and evaluate whether significant benefits have occurred with topical NSAIDs. We reviewed the evidence on the effect of locally applied NSAID eye preparations on restoring vision in people with diabetic CMO. Although various topical NSAIDs have been used to treat diabetic CMO, namely bromfenac 0.09%, nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5%, we did not find any RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that were eligible for this review. We also found that most of the studies identified through the electronic searches had been conducted to analyse the effect of topical NSAIDs for pseudophakic CMO. Greater research is required to understand the effects of topical NSAIDs on diabetic CMO. We would recommend a RCT to assess the effects of topical NSAIDs in patients with diabetic CMO. The trial would need to have a follow‐up of at least one year, and include a large sample size and a robust design in order to assess any potential long‐term beneficial or adverse effects of locally applied NSAIDs. Search date  The evidence is current to January 2015.",CD010009
"Background Breech presentation is associated with increased complications. Turning a breech baby to head first presentation using external cephalic version (ECV) attempts to reduce the chances of breech presentation at birth so as to avoid the adverse effects of breech vaginal birth or caesarean section. Interventions such as tocolytic drugs and other methods have been used in an attempt to facilitate ECV. Objectives To assess, from the best evidence available, the effects of interventions such as tocolysis, acoustic stimulation for midline spine position, regional analgesia (epidural or spinal), transabdominal amnioinfusion, systemic opioids and hypnosis, or the use of abdominal lubricants, on ECV at term for successful version, presentation at birth, method of birth and perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and the reference lists of identified studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing the above interventions with no intervention or other methods to facilitate ECV at term. Data collection and analysis We assessed eligibility and trial quality. Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy and independently extracted the data using a specially designed data extraction form. Main results We included 28 studies, providing data on 2786 women. We used the random‐effects model for pooling data because of clinical heterogeneity between studies. A number of trial reports gave insufficient information to allow clear assessment of risk of bias. We used GradePro software to carry out formal assessments of quality of the evidence for beta stimulants versus placebo and regional analgesia with tocolysis versus tocolysis alone. Tocolytic parenteral beta stimulants were effective in increasing cephalic presentations in labour (average risk ratio (RR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 2.48, five studies, 459 women, low‐quality evidence) and in reducing the number of caesarean sections (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88, six studies, 742 women, moderate‐quality evidence). Failure to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth was less likely for women receiving a parenteral beta stimulant (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92, four studies, 399 women, moderate‐quality evidence). No clear differences in fetal bradycardias were identified, although this was reported for only one study, which was underpowered for assessing this outcome. Failed external cephalic version was reported in nine studies (900 women), and women receiving parenteral beta stimulants were less likely to have failure compared with controls (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82, moderate‐quality evidence). Perinatal mortality and serious morbidity were not reported. Sensitivity analysis by study quality was consistent with overall findings. For other classes of tocolytic drugs (calcium channel blockers and nitric oxide donors), evidence was insufficient to permit conclusions; outcomes were reported for only one or two studies, which were underpowered to demonstrate differences between treatment and control groups. Little evidence was found regarding adverse effects, although nitric oxide donors were associated with increased risk of headache. Data comparing different tocolytic drugs were insufficient. Regional analgesia in combination with a tocolytic was more effective than the tocolytic alone for increasing successful versions (assessed by the rate of failed ECVs; average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86, five studies, 409 women, moderate‐quality evidence), and no difference was identified in cephalic presentation in labour (average RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.66, three studies, 279 women, very low‐quality evidence), caesarean sections (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.37, three studies, 279 women, very low‐quality evidence) nor fetal bradycardia (average RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.57, two studies, 210 women, low‐quality evidence), although studies were underpowered for assessing these outcomes. Studies did not report on failure to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth (breech vaginal deliveries plus caesarean sections) nor on perinatal mortality or serious infant morbidity. Data were insufficient on the use of regional analgesia without tocolysis, vibroacoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion, systemic opioids and hypnosis, and on the use of talcum powder or gel to assist external cephalic version, to permit conclusions about their effectiveness and safety. Authors' conclusions Parenteral beta stimulants were effective in facilitating successful ECV, increasing cephalic presentation in labour and reducing the caesarean section rate, but data on adverse effects were insufficient. Data on calcium channel blockers and nitric acid donors were insufficient to provide good evidence. The scope for further research is clear. Possible benefits of tocolysis in reducing the force required for successful version and possible risks of side effects need to be addressed further. Further trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of routine versus selective use of tocolysis and the role of regional analgesia, fetal acoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion and abdominal lubricants, and the effects of hypnosis, in facilitating ECV. Although randomised trials of nitric oxide donors are small, the results are sufficiently negative to discourage further trials. Intervention fidelity for ECV can be enhanced by standardisation of the techniques and processes used for clinical manipulation of the fetus in the abdominal cavity and ought to be the subject of further research.","Ways to help turn a breech baby to head first presentation at the end of pregnancy Babies born in the breech position (bottom first) are at increased risk of complications at birth because of a delay in birth of the head. Turning a breech baby to head first in late pregnancy may reduce these complications. A procedure called 'external cephalic version (ECV)' describes when practitioners use their hands on the woman's abdomen to gently try to turn the baby from the breech position to head first. A number of treatments may help the success of ECV. These include using tocolytic drugs (drugs like beta stimulants and calcium channel blockers that relax the womb), stimulating the baby with sound through the mother’s abdomen (acoustic stimulation), increasing the fluid surrounding the baby (transabdominal amnioinfusion), injecting pain‐relieving drugs into the mother’s lower back to produce regional analgesia (epidural or spinal analgesia), giving the mother opioid drugs to help her relax, using hypnosis and applying gel or talcum powder to the mother's abdomen.   This review of trials found 28 randomised controlled studies involving 2786 women. Most studies looked at the effects of tocolytic beta stimulant drugs. Results showed that babies are more likely to turn head first during ECV and to remain head first for the start of labour, if women receive beta stimulants. These drugs also reduced the number of caesarean sections, but insufficient data on possible adverse effects were collected. Little information on other types of tocolytic drugs was available, although nitric oxide donors were associated with an increase in headaches. In addition, too little evidence was available to show whether the other ways of trying to help ECV are effective. Further research is needed if we are to increase the success of ECV.",CD000184
"Background In people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgical interventions, haemostatic treatment is needed in order to correct the underlying coagulation abnormalities and minimise the bleeding risk. This treatment varies according to the specific haemostatic defect, its severity and the type of surgical procedure. The aim of treatment is to ensure adequate haemostatic coverage for as long as the bleeding risk persists and until wound healing is complete. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different haemostatic regimens (type, dose and duration, modality of administration and target haemostatic levels) administered in people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders for preventing bleeding complications during and after surgical procedures. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the last search: 20 November 2014. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any hemostatic treatment regimen to no treatment or to another active regimen in children and adults with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing any surgical intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials (eligibility and risks of bias) and extracted data. Meta‐analyses were performed on available and relevant data. Main results Of the 16 identified trials, four (112 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A and B undergoing 63 dental extractions. Trials compared the use of a different type (tranexamic acid or epsilon‐aminocaproic acid) and regimen of antifibrinolytic agents as haemostatic support to the initial replacement treatment. Neither trial specifically addressed mortality (one of this review's primary outcomes); however, in the frame of safety assessments, no fatal adverse events were reported. The second primary outcome of blood loss was assessed after surgery and these trials showed the reduction of blood loss and requirement of post‐operative replacement treatment in people receiving antifibrinolytic agents compared with placebo. The remaining primary outcome of need for re‐intervention was not reported by either trial. Two trials reported on 53 people with haemophilia A and B with inhibitors treated with different regimens of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for haemostatic coverage of 33 major and 20 minor surgical interventions. Neither of the included trials specifically addressed any of the review's primary outcomes (mortality, blood loss and need for re‐intervention). In one trial a high‐dose rFVIIa regimen (90 μg/kg) was compared with a low‐dose regimen (35 μg/kg); the higher dose showed increased haemostatic efficacy, in particular in major surgery, with shorter duration of treatment, similar total dose of rFVIIa administered and similar safety levels. In the second trial, bolus infusion and continuous infusion of rFVIIa were compared, showing similar haemostatic efficacy, duration of treatment and safety. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess the most effective and safe haemostatic treatment to prevent bleeding in people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgical procedures. Ideally large, adequately powered, and well‐designed randomised controlled trials would be needed, in particular to address the cost‐effectiveness of such demanding treatments in the light of the increasing present economic constraints, and to explore the new challenge of ageing patients with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders. However, performing such trials is always a complex task in this setting and presently does not appear to be a clinical and research priority. Indeed, major and minor surgeries are effectively and safely performed in these individuals in clinical practice, with the numerous national and international recommendations and guidelines providing regimens for treatment in this setting mainly based on data from observational, uncontrolled studies.","Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery In haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. The trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority. Indeed, both major and minor surgery are safely performed in clinical practice in these individuals based on local experience and data from uncontrolled studies.",CD009961
"Background Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is proposed as an accurate diagnostic device for the locoregional staging of gastric cancer, which is crucial to developing a correct therapeutic strategy and ultimately to providing patients with the best chance of cure. However, despite a number of studies addressing this issue, there is no consensus on the role of EUS in routine clinical practice. Objectives To provide both a comprehensive overview and a quantitative analysis of the published data regarding the ability of EUS to preoperatively define the locoregional disease spread (i.e., primary tumor depth (T‐stage) and regional lymph node status (N‐stage)) in people with primary gastric carcinoma.  Search methods We performed a systematic search to identify articles that examined the diagnostic accuracy of EUS (the index test) in the evaluation of primary gastric cancer depth of invasion (T‐stage, according to the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system categories T1, T2, T3 and T4) and regional lymph node status (N‐stage, disease‐free (N0) versus metastatic (N+)) using histopathology as the reference standard. To this end, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Library  (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), MEDLINE, EMBASE ,  NIHR Prospero Register, MEDION, Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF), ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials MetaRegister, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), from 1988 to January 2015. Selection criteria We included studies that met the following main inclusion criteria: 1) a minimum sample size of 10 patients with histologically‐proven primary carcinoma of the stomach (target condition); 2) comparison of EUS (index test) with pathology evaluation (reference standard) in terms of primary tumor (T‐stage) and regional lymph nodes (N‐stage). We excluded reports with possible overlap with the selected studies. Data collection and analysis For each study, two review authors extracted a standard set of data, using a dedicated data extraction form. We assessed data quality using a standard procedure according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) criteria. We performed diagnostic accuracy meta‐analysis using the hierarchical bivariate method. Main results We identified 66 articles (published between 1988 and 2012) that were eligible according to the inclusion criteria. We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who were staged with EUS. Overall the quality of the included studies was good: in particular, only five studies presented a high risk of index test interpretation bias and two studies presented a high risk of selection bias. For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to the depth of invasion of the gastric wall. The meta‐analysis of 50 studies (n = 4397) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity of EUS in discriminating T1 to T2 (superficial) versus T3 to T4 (advanced) gastric carcinomas were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.90) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.93) respectively. For the diagnostic capacity of EUS to distinguish T1 (early gastric cancer, EGC) versus T2 (muscle‐infiltrating) tumors, the meta‐analysis of 46 studies (n = 2742) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93) respectively. When we addressed the capacity of EUS to distinguish between T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers the meta‐analysis of 20 studies (n = 3321) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.84) respectively. Finally, for the metastatic involvement of lymph nodes (N‐stage), the meta‐analysis of 44 studies (n = 3573) showed that the summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.87) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.72), respectively. Overall, as demonstrated also by the Bayesian nomograms, which enable readers to calculate post‐test probabilities for any target condition prevalence, the EUS accuracy can be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric cancer. However, it should be noted that between‐study heterogeneity was not negligible: unfortunately, we could not identify any consistent source of the observed heterogeneity. Therefore, all accuracy measures reported in the present work and summarizing the available evidence should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, we must emphasize that the analysis of positive and negative likelihood values revealed that EUS diagnostic performance cannot be considered optimal either for disease confirmation or for exclusion, especially for the ability of EUS to distinguish T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers and positive versus negative lymph node status. Authors' conclusions By analyzing the data from the largest series ever considered, we found that the diagnostic accuracy of EUS might be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric carcinoma. However, the heterogeneity of the results warrants special caution, as well as further investigation for the identification of factors influencing the outcome of this diagnostic tool. Moreover, physicians should be warned that EUS performance is lower in diagnosing superficial tumors (T1a versus T1b) and lymph node status (positive versus negative). Overall, we observed large heterogeneity and its source needs to be understood before any definitive conclusion can be drawn about the use of EUS can be proposed in routine clinical settings.","Ultrasound for determining the spread of stomach cancer Review question There is much debate on the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer. The aim of this review was to collect the available evidence and then to calculate how well EUS stages stomach cancer. Background EUS is a diagnostic test that can be used to determine how far (stage) cancer of the stomach reaches prior to surgery. It consists of an endoscope coupled with an ultrasound device capable of scanning the stomach wall, which shows the different layers of the stomach. Changes from the normal ultrasonographic patterns due to the tumor growth can be used to determine the extent of cancer in the stomach wall (T‐stage) and the lymph nodes related to the stomach (N‐stage). Since the correct staging of the tumor enables physicians to personalize cancer treatment, it is important to understand the reliability of staging devices. Study characteristics We conducted a meta‐analysis according to the most recent methods for diagnostic tests. The last literature search was performed in January 2015. We included 66 studies (of 7747 patients) in the review. Key results We found that EUS can distinguish between superficial (T1 ‐ T2) and advanced (T3 ‐ T4) primary tumors with a sensitivity and a specificity greater than 85%. This performance is maintained for the discrimination between T1 and T2 superficial tumors. However, EUS diagnostic accuracy is lower when it comes to distinguishing between the different types of early tumors (T1a versus T1b) and between tumors with versus those without lymph node disease. Quality of the evidence Overall, EUS provides physicians with some helpful information on the stage of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, in the light of the variability of the results reported in the international medical literature, its limitations in terms of performance must be kept in mind in order to make the most out of the diagnostic potential of this tool. Finally, more work is needed to assess whether some technical improvements and the combination with other staging instruments may increase our ability to correctly stage the disease and thus optimize patient treatment.",CD009944
"Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2013. There is good evidence that combining two different analgesics in fixed doses in a single tablet can provide better pain relief in acute pain and headache than either drug alone, and that the drug‐specific effects are essentially additive. This appears to be broadly true in postoperative pain and migraine headache across a range of different drug combinations and when tested in the same and different trials. Some combinations of ibuprofen and codeine are available without prescription (but usually only from a pharmacy) where the dose of codeine is lower, and with a prescription when the dose of codeine is higher. Use of combination analgesics that contain codeine has been a source of some concern because of misuse from over‐the‐counter preparations. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus codeine for acute moderate‐to‐severe postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the reference lists of articles. The date of the most recent search was 1 December 2014. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐ or active‐controlled clinical trials of single dose oral ibuprofen plus codeine for acute postoperative pain in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants prescribed ibuprofen plus codeine, placebo, or the same dose of ibuprofen alone with at least 50% pain relief over six hours, using validated equations. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on the use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse effects. Analyses were planned for different doses of ibuprofen and codeine, but especially for codeine where we set criteria for low (< 10 mg), medium (10 to 20 mg), and high (> 20 mg) doses. Main results Since the last version of this review no new studies were found. Information was available from six studies with 1342 participants, using a variety of doses of ibuprofen and codeine. In four studies (443 participants) using ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 mg to 60 mg (high dose codeine) 64% of participants had at least 50% maximum pain relief with the combination compared to 18% with placebo. The NNT was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.6) (high quality evidence). In three studies (204 participants) ibuprofen plus codeine (any dose) was better than the same dose of ibuprofen (69% versus 55%) but the result was barely significant with a relative benefit of 1.3 (1.01 to 1.6) (moderate quality evidence). In two studies (159 participants) ibuprofen plus codeine appeared to be better than the same dose of codeine alone (69% versus 33%), but no analysis was done. There was no difference between the combination and placebo in the reporting of adverse events in these acute studies (moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 mg to 60 mg demonstrates good analgesic efficacy. Very limited data suggest that the combination is better than the same dose of either drug alone, and that similar numbers of people experience adverse events with the combination as with placebo.","Single dose oral ibuprofen plus codeine for acute postoperative pain in adults Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers are tested in people with pain, often following the removal of wisdom teeth. This pain is usually treated with painkillers taken by mouth. Results can be applied to other forms of acute pain. A series of Cochrane reviews looks at how good painkillers are. We know that in some circumstances combining different analgesics in the same tablet gives good pain relief to more people than either analgesic alone. This is particularly true using a combination of two painkillers that work by different mechanisms. This review looked at how good the combination of ibuprofen and codeine was in relieving moderate or severe pain after surgery, and is an update of an earlier review conducted in 2013. For the original review, we found six studies with 1342 participants. For this update we searched up to December 2014, but found no additional studies. Ibuprofen 400 mg plus high doses of codeine (25.6 mg to 60 mg) provided effective pain relief for over 6 in 10 (64%) of participants, compared with just under 2 in 10 (18%) of participants with placebo (high quality evidence). Adverse events occurred at similar rates with the ibuprofen/codeine combination and placebo in these single dose studies (moderate quality evidence). No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events occurred with the combination. It is important not to exceed the recommended dose for this combination painkiller.",CD010107
"Background Genital tract infection is associated with preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). Screening for infections during pregnancy may therefore reduce the numbers of babies being born prematurely. However, screening for infections may have some adverse effects, such as increased antibiotic drug resistance and increased cost of treatment. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for reducing preterm birth and subsequent morbidity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2014, Issue 7) and reference lists of retrieved reports. Selection criteria We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials in any language that evaluated any described methods of antenatal lower genital tract infection screening compared with no screening. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. Main results One study (4155 women at less than 20 weeks' gestation) met the inclusion criteria. The intervention group (2058 women) received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis; the control group (2097 women) also received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed and women received routine antenatal care. The rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was significantly lower in the intervention group (3% versus 5% in the control group) with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.75; the evidence for this outcome was graded as of moderate quality). The incidence of preterm birth for infants with a weight equal to or below 2500 g (low birthweight) and infants with a weight equal to or below 1500 g (very low birthweight) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66 and RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75, respectively; both graded as moderate quality evidence). Based on a subset of costs for preterm births of < 1900 g, the authors reported that for each of those preterm births averted, EUR 60,262 would be saved. Authors' conclusions There is evidence from one trial that infection screening and treatment programs for pregnant women before 20 weeks' gestation reduce preterm birth and preterm low birthweight. Infection screening and treatment programs are associated with cost savings when used for the prevention of preterm birth. Future trials should evaluate the effects of different types of infection screening programs.","Antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for preventing preterm delivery A genital tract infection during pregnancy can cross into the amniotic fluid and result in prelabour rupture of the membranes and preterm labour. Preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) is associated with poor infant health, death, admission of the newborn to neonatal intensive care in the first few weeks of life, prolonged hospital stay and long‐term neurologic disability including cerebral palsy.    In this review, only one study of moderate quality evidence was included. The study reported on 4155 women randomly assigned either to an intervention group (2058 women received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis) or a control group (2097 women received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed). The present systematic review found that a simple infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care may reduce preterm births and preterm low (below 2500 g) and very low (below 1500 g) birthweight. The simple infection screening reduced preterm births from 5% of women in the control group to 3% in the intervention group. The number of low birthweight preterm infants and very low birthweight preterm infants were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Moreover, an infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care is likely to save over EUR 60,000 for each preterm birth averted.",CD006178
"Background Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia may have long‐term advantages for the patient; the longer psychosis goes untreated the more severe the repercussions for relapse and recovery. If the correct diagnosis is not schizophrenia, but another psychotic disorder with some symptoms similar to schizophrenia, appropriate treatment might be delayed, with possible severe repercussions for the person involved and their family. There is widespread uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of First Rank Symptoms (FRS); we examined whether they are a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of one or multiple FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia, verified by clinical history and examination by a qualified professional (e.g. psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), with or without the use of operational criteria and checklists, in people thought to have non‐organic psychotic symptoms. Search methods We conducted searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using  OvidSP  in April, June, July 2011 and December 2012. We also searched MEDION in December 2013. Selection criteria We selected studies that consecutively enrolled or randomly selected adults and adolescents with symptoms of psychosis, and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of FRS for schizophrenia compared to history and clinical examination performed by a qualified professional, which may or may not involve the use of symptom checklists or based on operational criteria such as ICD and DSM. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all references for inclusion. Risk of bias in included studies were assessed using the QUADAS‐2 instrument. We recorded the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for constructing a 2 x 2 table for each study or derived 2 x 2 data from reported summary statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, and/or likelihood ratios. Main results We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis). Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%), and a specificity of 81.4% (74% to 87.1%) In seven studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from non‐psychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% (51.7% to 71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%). In sixteen studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%). Authors' conclusions The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. The use of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five to 19 people in every 100 who have FRS as having schizophrenia and specialists will not agree with this diagnosis. These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state. Again, with a sensitivity of FRS of 60%, reliance on FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia. Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment. Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia, could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage relies on the presence of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia. Empathetic, considerate use of FRS as a diagnostic aid ‐ with known limitations ‐ should avoid a good proportion of these errors. We hope that newer tests ‐ to be included in future Cochrane reviews ‐ will show better results. However, symptoms of first rank can still be helpful where newer tests are not available ‐ a situation which applies to the initial screening of most people with suspected schizophrenia. FRS remain a simple, quick and useful clinical indicator for an illness of enormous clinical variability.","First rank symptoms for schizophrenia It is important for patients with psychosis to be correctly diagnosed as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is diagnosed the better the treatment outcome. However, other diseases sometimes have similar psychotic symptoms as schizophrenia, for example bipolar disorder. This review looks at how accurate First Rank Symptoms (FRS) are at diagnosing schizophrenia. FRS are symptoms that people with psychosis may experience, for example hallucinations, hearing voices and thinking that other people can hear their thoughts. We found 21 studies, with 6253 participants, that looked at how good FRS are at diagnosing schizophrenia when compared to a diagnosis made by a psychiatrist. These studies showed that for people who actually have schizophrenia, FRS would only correctly diagnose just over half of them as schizophrenic. For people who do not have schizophrenia, almost 20% would be incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, if a person is experiencing a FRS, schizophrenia is a possible diagnosis, but there is also a chance that it is another mental health disorder. We do not recommend that FRS alone can be used to diagnose schizophrenia. However, FRS could be useful to triage patients who need to be assessed by a psychiatrist.",CD010653
"Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in people under the age of 45 years. Over the past 20 years, intraoperative autologous transfusions (obtained by cell salvage, also known as intraoperative blood salvage (IBS)) have been used as an alternative to blood products from other individuals during surgery because of the risk of transfusion‐related infections such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this review, we sought to assess the effects and cost of cell salvage in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic surgery. Objectives To compare the effect and cost of cell salvage with those of standard care in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery. Search methods We ran the search on 25 November 2014. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library ), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE, EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (SCI‐Expanded & CPSI‐SSH). We also screened reference lists and contacted principal investigators. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing cell salvage with no cell salvage (standard care) in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from the trial reports. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Only one small study (n = 44) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results suggested that cell salvage did not affect mortality overall (death rates were 67% (14/21 participants) in the cell salvage group and 65% (15/23) in the control group) (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 3.72). For individuals with abdominal injury, mortality was also similar in both groups (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.10). Less donor blood was needed for transfusion within the first 24 hours postinjury in the cell salvage group compared with the control group (mean difference (MD) ‐4.70 units, 95% CI ‐8.09 to ‐1.31). Adverse events, notably postoperative sepsis, did not differ between groups (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.55). Cost did not notably differ between groups (MD ‐177.81, 95% CI ‐452.85 to 97.23, measured in GBP in 2002). Authors' conclusions Evidence for the use of cell salvage in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery remains equivocal. Large, multicentre, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to assess the relative efficacy, safety and cost‐effectiveness of cell salvage in different surgical procedures in the emergency context.","In people undergoing emergency surgery to the chest or abdomen, how effective is transfusing a person's own blood compared with donor blood Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in people under the age of 45 years. Over the past 20 years, transfusions using an individual's own blood, salvaged during surgery through a process called 'cell salvage' (also known as intraoperative blood salvage), have been used as an alternative to blood products donated from other individuals (standard care) during surgical procedures. Many people prefer this because of the risk of transfusion‐related infections such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from donor blood. In this review, we aimed to determine how effective cell salvage is, compared with usual care, in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic (chest) trauma surgery. We considered outcomes including the survival of the individual, their need for extra blood and the costs of this procedure compared with standard care. Search date Evidence in this review is current to 25 November 2014. Study characteristics We identified one randomised controlled trial, which involved people with a penetrating injury to the chest. In this study, 44 people (mostly male and with similar characteristics in terms of type of injury) were given either their own reprocessed blood (through cell salvage) or standard care using donated blood. The study was conducted at a hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. Results Results indicated no important differences between the two groups of participants with regard to survival, postoperative infection, or cost. There was a reduction in the amount of banked blood (blood that has been donated and stored) required for transfusion within the first 24 hours following injury among people receiving cell salvage. Data on other adverse events were not reported. We believe that larger, multicentre, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to assess the relative efficacy, safety and cost‐effectiveness of cell salvage in trauma surgery and other surgical procedures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the one study identified was high, but the number of participants was not large. No firm conclusions can be drawn as to the safety and effectiveness of cell salvage in individuals undergoing abdominal or thoracic trauma surgery.",CD007379
"Background The presence and progression of hepatic (liver) fibrosis into cirrhosis is a prognostic variable having impact on survival in people with alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy, although an invasive method, is the recommended 'reference standard' for diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis in people with liver diseases. Transient elastography is a non‐invasive method for assessing and staging hepatic fibrosis. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosis and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. To identify the optimal cut‐off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis. Search methods The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Registers,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Science Citation Index Expanded (last search August 2014). Selection criteria Diagnostic cohort and diagnostic case‐control study designs that assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease with transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status. The study participants could be of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, hospitalised or managed as outpatients. We excluded participants with viral hepatitis, autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, and toxins. Data collection and analysis We followed the guidelines in the draft  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy. Main results Five retrospective and nine prospective cohort studies with 834 participants provided data for the review analyses. Authors of seven of those studies sent us individual participant data. The risk of bias in the included studies was high in all but three studies. We could identify no serious concerns regarding the applicability of the studies in answering the main study question of our review, namely to use transient elastography to diagnose hepatic fibrosis. We could not identify the optimal cut‐off values for the fibrosis stages. The definition of the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease was not provided in one study and was not clearly defined in two studies, but it was clear in the remaining 11 studies. The study authors used different liver stiffness cut‐off values of transient elastography for the hepatic fibrosis stages. There was only one study (103 participants) with data on hepatic fibrosis stage F1 or worse, with a cut‐off of 5.9 kPa, and reporting sensitivity of 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.90) and specificity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00). The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography for F2 or worse (seven studies with 338 participants and with cut‐offs around 7.5 kPa (range 7.00 to 7.8 kPa)) were 0.94 and 0.89 with LR+ 8.2 and LR‐ 0.07, which suggests that transient elastography could be useful to rule out the presence of significant hepatic fibrosis, thus avoiding liver biopsy. Due to the wide range of cut‐off values (from 8.0 to 17.0 kPa) found in the 10 studies with 760 participants with hepatic fibrosis F3 or worse, we fitted a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and estimated a summary ROC (SROC) curve. The sensitivity of the 10 studies varied from 72% to 100% and the specificity from 59% to 89%. We performed an additional analysis by including the studies with a cut‐off value of around and equal to 9.5 kPa (range 8.0 to 11.0 kPa). The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography (eight studies with 564 participants) were 0.92 and 0.70 with LR+ 3.1 and LR‐ 0.11, which suggests that transient elastography could also be useful to rule out the presence of severe hepatic fibrosis (F3 or worse), avoiding liver biopsy. We carried out a sensitivity analysis by considering only the studies with a cut‐off value equal to 9.5 kPa and the result did not differ. We performed an HSROC analysis and reported an SROC curve for hepatic fibrosis stage F4 (cirrhosis). The HSROC analysis suggested that when the cut‐off value changes, there is a wide variation in specificity and a more limited variation in sensitivity. We performed an additional analysis with the studies with the most commonly used cut‐off value of 12.5 kPa. The summary sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography (seven studies with 330 participants) were 0.95 and 0.71 with LR+ 3.3 and LR‐ 0.07, which again suggests that transient elastography could be useful to rule out the presence of cirrhosis, avoiding liver biopsy. Authors' conclusions We identified a small number of studies with a few participants and were unable to include several studies, which raises the risk of outcome reporting bias. With these caveats in mind, transient elastography may be used as a diagnostic method to rule out liver cirrhosis (F4) in people with alcoholic liver disease when the pre‐test probability is about 51% (range 15% to 79%). Transient elastography may also help in ruling out severe fibrosis (F3 or worse). Liver biopsy investigation remains an option if the certainty to rule in or rule out the stage of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis remains insufficient after a clinical follow‐up or any other non‐invasive test considered useful by the clinician. The proposed cut‐off values for the different stages of hepatic fibrosis may be used in clinical practice, but caution is needed, as those values reported in this review are only the most common cut‐off values used by the study authors. The best cut‐off values for hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease could not be established yet. In order to diagnose correctly the stage of hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease using transient elastography assessment, the studies should consider a single aetiology. Hepatic fibrosis should be diagnosed with both transient elastography and liver biopsy and in this sequence, and transient elastography cut‐off values should be pre‐specified and validated. The time interval between the two investigations should not exceed three months, which is the interval mainly valid for people without cirrhosis, and assessment of results should be properly blinded. Only studies with low risk of bias, fulfilling the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy may answer the review question.","Transient elastography for measurement of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease Background Liver fibrosis is a change in the microscopic structure of the liver because of liver inflammation. After many years of excessive alcohol consumption, liver fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis. Abstaining from alcohol may stop the fibrosis from further progression into significant or severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. The latter lead to complications of underlying diseases, including cancer. Measurement of the amount of fibrosis is called staging. There are five stages (F0: no scarring (no fibrosis); F1: minimal scarring; F2: scarring has occurred and extends outside the liver area (significant fibrosis); F3: fibrosis spreading and forming bridges with other fibrotic liver areas (severe fibrosis); F4: cirrhosis or advanced scarring). Cut‐off values may distinguish between the different stages of fibrosis, but in people with alcoholic liver disease, the best cut‐off values have not been determined yet. Rationale Liver biopsy is where a sample of tissue is taken from the liver using a small needle. It is the standard method of detecting and measuring fibrosis. Transient elastography measures stiffening of the liver caused by progressive scarring, but it has not been validated in people with alcoholic liver disease. Aims To find out how well transient elastography may determine the presence or absence of fibrosis and if it can stage fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. Methods Using Cochrane methods and searching the literature (August 2014), the review authors obtained results from 14 studies (834 participants), out of which only seven included people with only alcoholic liver disease. Participants underwent both transient elastography (the index test) and liver biopsy (the standard test). Findings and conclusions The number of studies and participants was small and the participants had different severity of liver fibrosis. Only four studies were judged good quality. Transient elastography fibrosis stage F2 or worse (significant fibrosis) There were seven studies with 338 participants: 81% of people had significant fibrosis. Out of 1000 people, 810 will have significant fibrosis. Of these 810 people, 49 people would be missed even though they had significant fibrosis. A clinical follow‐up could provide physicians with knowledge for the next diagnostic step. The remaining 190 people would not have significant fibrosis; 21 people would have unnecessary worries about their liver fibrosis stage. Transient elastography fibrosis stage F3 or worse (severe fibrosis) There were eight studies with 564 participants: 61% of people had severe fibrosis. Out of 1000 people, 610 would have severe fibrosis. Of these 610 people, 49 people would be missed even though they had severe fibrosis. A clinical follow‐up could provide physicians with knowledge for the next diagnostic step. The remaining 390 people would not have severe fibrosis; 117 people would have unnecessary worries about their liver fibrosis stage. Transient elastography fibrosis stage F4 (cirrhosis) There were seven studies with 330 participants: 51% of people had cirrhosis. Out of 1000 people, 510 will have cirrhosis. Of these 510 people, 26 people would be missed even though they had cirrhosis. A clinical follow‐up could provide physicians with knowledge for the next diagnostic step. The remaining 490 people would not have cirrhosis; 143 people would have unnecessary worries about their liver fibrosis stage. Transient elastography may be used as a diagnostic tool to rule out liver cirrhosis and may also help in ruling out severe fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy investigation still remains an option if the certainty to rule in or rule out the stage of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis remains insufficient after a clinical follow‐up or any other non‐invasive test considered useful by the clinician. The best cut‐off values for differentiating between the five liver fibrosis stages could still not be established. Future studies should include only people with alcoholic liver disease. Hepatic fibrosis should be diagnosed with transient elastography followed by liver biopsy and the transient elastography cut‐off values of liver stiffness for the different stages of liver fibrosis should be decided before the test occurs. The time interval between the two tests should not exceed three months, an interval that is mainly valid for people without cirrhosis. Assessors of results should be unaware of the treatment given.",CD010542
"Background Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is an accepted surgical technique for the treatment of a variety of benign diseases. Presently, the use of MIS in patients with cancer is progressing. However, the role of MIS in children with solid neoplasms is less clear than it is in adults. Although the use of diagnostic MIS to obtain biopsy specimens for pathology is accepted in paediatric surgical oncology, there is limited evidence to support the use of MIS for the resection of malignancies. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives To ascertain differences in outcome between the minimally invasive and open surgical approaches for the treatment of solid intra‐abdominal or intra‐thoracic neoplasms in children. The primary outcomes of interest are OS, EFS, port‐site metastases and recurrence rate; the secondary outcome of interest is surgical morbidity. Search methods We searched CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1966 to February 2014) and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to February 2014) to identify relevant studies. In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 2003 to 2013. On 1 May 2014 we scanned the ISRCTN Register (on www.controlled‐trials.com), the National Institutes of Health register (on www.controlled‐trials.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (on www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing MIS to open surgery for the treatment of solid intra‐thoracic or intra‐abdominal neoplasms in children (aged 0 to 18 years) were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors performed the study selection independently. Main results The literature search retrieved 542 references. After screening the titles and abstracts we excluded 534 references which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. We assessed eight full text studies for eligibility and all of these studies were excluded from the review because they were not RCTs or CCTs. These excluded studies included case series, retrospective chart reviews and retrospective cohort studies. The scanning of reference lists and conference proceedings did not identify any additional studies and no (ongoing trials) were identified by the searches of trial registries. No studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review were identified Authors' conclusions No RCTs or CCTs evaluating MIS for the treatment of solid intra‐thoracic or intra‐abdominal neoplasms in children could be identified. The current evidence base informing the use of MIS in children with solid abdominal and thoracic neoplasms is based on other study designs like case reports, retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies and should be interpreted with caution. Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding the use of MIS in these patients. High quality RCTs comparing MIS to open surgery are required. To accomplish this, centres specialising in MIS in children should collaborate.",Minimally invasive surgery compared to open surgery for the treatment of solid tumours located in the chest or the abdomen of children Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is an upcoming new surgical technique. MIS is done through one or more small incisions using a laparoscope or thoracoscope (a thin flexible tube containing a video camera) and surgical instruments. MIS can be used as a diagnostic instrument (i.e. to retrieve tissue samples for a biopsy) and is also used for the resection (i.e. to remove by surgery) of tumours (a lump or growth in a part of the body that is formed from abnormal cells). There is limited experience with the use of MIS for the resection of solid tumours in the chest or abdomen in children. This systematic review focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). The authors could not identify any RCTs or CCTs RCTs on this subject. Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding the therapeutic use of MIS in children with solid tumours in the chest or abdomen. More high quality RCTs are needed.,CD008403
"Background Uterine fibroids cause heavy prolonged bleeding, pain, pressure symptoms and subfertility. The traditional method of treatment has been surgery as medical therapies have not proven effective. Uterine artery embolization has been reported to be an effective and safe alternative to treat fibroids in women not desiring future fertility. There is a significant body of evidence that is based on case controlled studies and case reports. This is an update of the review previously published in 2012. Objectives To review the benefits and risks of uterine artery embolization (UAE) versus other medical or surgical interventions for symptomatic uterine fibroids. Search methods We searched sources including the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries. The search was last conducted in April 2014. We contacted authors of eligible randomised controlled trials to request unpublished data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of UAE versus any medical or surgical therapy for symptomatic uterine fibroids. The primary outcomes of the review were patient satisfaction and live birth rate (among women seeking live birth). Data collection and analysis Two of the authors (AS and JKG) independently selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE methods. Main results Seven RCTs with 793 women were included in this review. Three trials compared UAE with abdominal hysterectomy, two trials compared UAE with myomectomy, and two trials compared UAE with either type of surgery (53 hysterectomies and 62 myomectomies). With regard to patient satisfaction rates, our findings were consistent with satisfaction rates being up to 41% lower or up to 48% higher with UAE compared to surgery within 24 months of having the procedure (odds ratio (OR) 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.48, 6 trials, 640 women, I 2  = 5%, moderate quality evidence). Findings were also inconclusive at five years of follow‐up (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.80, 2 trials, 295 women, I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was some indication that UAE may be associated with less favourable fertility outcomes than myomectomy, but it was very low quality evidence from a subgroup of a single study and should be regarded with extreme caution (live birth: OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.84; pregnancy: OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.85, 1 study, 66 women). Similarly, for several safety outcomes our findings showed evidence of a substantially higher risk of adverse events in either arm or of no difference between the groups. This applied to intra‐procedural complications (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.97, 4 trials, 452 women, I 2  = 40%, low quality evidence), major complications within one year (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.26, 5 trials, 611 women, I 2  = 4%, moderate quality evidence) and major complications within five years (OR 0.56; CI 0.27 to 1.18, 2 trials, 268 women). However, the rate of minor complications within one year was higher in the UAE group (OR 1.99; CI 1.41 to 2.81, 6 trials, 735 women, I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence) and two trials found a higher minor complication rate in the UAE group at up to five years (OR 2.93; CI 1.73 to 4.93, 2 trials, 268 women). UAE was associated with a higher rate of further surgical interventions (re‐interventions within 2 years: OR 3.72; 95% CI 2.28 to 6.04, 6 trials, 732 women, I 2  = 45%, moderate quality evidence; within 5 years: OR 5.79; 95% CI 2.65 to 12.65, 2 trials, 289 women, I 2  = 65%). If we assumed that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. The evidence suggested that women in the UAE group were less likely to require a blood transfusion than women receiving surgery (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.52, 2 trials, 277 women, I 2  = 0%). UAE was also associated with a shorter procedural time (two studies), shorter length of hospital stay (seven studies) and faster resumption of usual activities (six studies) in all studies that measured these outcomes; however, most of these data could not be pooled due to heterogeneity between the studies. The quality of the evidence varied, and was very low for live birth, moderate for satisfaction ratings, and moderate for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes. Authors' conclusions When we compared patient satisfaction rates at up to two years following UAE versus surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy) our findings are that there is no evidence of a difference between the interventions. Findings at five year follow‐up were similarly inconclusive. There was very low quality evidence to suggest that myomectomy may be associated with better fertility outcomes than UAE, but this information was only available from a selected subgroup in one small trial. We found no clear evidence of a difference between UAE and surgery in the risk of major complications, but UAE was associated with a higher rate of minor complications and an increased likelihood of requiring surgical intervention within two to five years of the initial procedure. If we assume that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. This increase in the surgical re‐intervention rate may balance out any initial cost advantage of UAE. Thus although UAE is a safe, minimally invasive alternative to surgery, patient selection and counselling are paramount due to the much higher risk of requiring further surgical intervention.","Uterine artery embolization for symptomatic uterine fibroids Review question Is uterine artery embolization a safe and effective alternative treatment in women with symptomatic fibroids? Background Uterine fibroids (benign tumours) can cause varied symptoms such as heavy bleeding, pain and reduced likelihood of pregnancy. Surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy) has traditionally been the main treatment option but it carries a risk of complications. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a newer treatment option which blocks the blood supply to the womb and thus shrinks the fibroids and reduces their effects. The evidence was current to April 2014. Study characteristics There were seven studies included in the review (793 participants). Three of these compared UAE with hysterectomy, two studies compared UAE with myomectomy, and another two with hysterectomy or myomectomy. The studies differed in their outcomes and length of follow‐up. Key results With regard to patient satisfaction rates, our findings were consistent with satisfaction rates being up to 41% lower or up to 48% higher with UAE compared to surgery within 24 months of having the procedure. Findings on satisfaction rates were also inconclusive at five years of follow‐up. There was very low quality evidence to suggest that fertility outcomes (live birth and pregnancy) may be better after myomectomy than after UAE, but this evidence was based on a small selected subgroup and should be regarded with extreme caution. The UAE group had a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to daily activities. With regards to safety, the evidence on major complications was inconclusive and consistent with benefit or harm, or no difference, from either intervention. However, the risk of minor complications was higher after UAE. Moreover, there was a higher likelihood of needing another surgical intervention after UAE, at two year and at five year follow‐up. If we assumed that 7% of women will require further surgery within two years of hysterectomy or myomectomy, between 15% and 32% will require further surgery within two years of UAE. Therefore, it appears that while UAE is a safe option with an earlier initial recovery, it does carry a higher risk of minor complications and the need for further surgery later on. Quality of the evidence: The quality of the evidence varied from very low for live birth, to moderate for satisfaction ratings and for most safety outcomes. The main limitations in the evidence were serious imprecision, failure to clearly report methods, and lack of blinding for subjective outcomes.",CD005073
"Background Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. Data collection and analysis A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria ( GRADE 2004 ), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. Main results We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on  Solidago chilensis M.  (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel.  Capsicum frutescens  cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants,  moderate quality evidence ). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants,  low quality evidence ). Another trial found equivalence of  C. frutescens  cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants,  very low quality evidence ). Daily doses of  Harpagophytum procumbens  (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants,  low quality evidence ). Another  H. procumbens  trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants,  very low quality ). Daily doses of  Salix alba  (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants,  moderate quality evidence ). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence.  S. alba  minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining  Symphytum officinale L.  (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants, very low quality evidence ). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. Authors' conclusions C. frutescens  (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although  H. procumbens ,  S. alba ,  S. officinale L. ,  S. chilensis , and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicine for low‐back pain Review question We examined the evidence regarding the effect of herbal medicine on pain in people with non‐specific low‐back pain (LBP). Background   Back pain is common and up to 35% of the population can be affected in a given month. Non‐specific LBP is defined as pain between the lowest rib and the bottom of the buttocks that is not caused by serious, underlying problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, infection, fracture, cancer, or sciatica due to a ruptured disc or other pressure on nerves. Herbal medicines taken orally or applied to the skin are being used to treat many conditions including back pain. Study characteristics   Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence available up to August 5, 2013. Fourteen studies tested six herbal medications and included 2050 adults with non‐specific acute or chronic LBP. Two oral herbal medications,  Harpagophytum procumbens  (devil's claw) and  Salix alba  (white willow bark), were compared to placebo (fake or sham pills) or to rofecoxib (Vioxx®). Three topical creams, plasters, or gels,  Capsicum frutescens  (cayenne),  Symphytum officinale  L. (comfrey), and  Solidago chilensis  (Brazilian arnica), were compared to placebo creams or plasters and a homeopathic gel. One essential oil, lavender, was compared to no treatment. The average age of people included in the trials was 52 years and studies usually lasted three weeks. Key results   Devil's claw, in a standardized daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may reduce pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 60 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx®. While willow bark, in a standardized daily dose of 120 mg and 240 mg of salicin reduced pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 240 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx® (a non‐steroidal, anti‐inflammatory drug). Cayenne was tested in several forms: in plaster form, it reduced pain more than placebo and about the same as the homeopathic gel Spiroflor SLR. Two other ointment‐based medications,  S. officinale  and  S. chilensis  appeared to reduce perception of pain more than placebo creams. Lavender essential oil applied by acupressure appeared effective in reducing pain and improving flexibility compared to conventional treatment. Adverse effects were reported, but appeared to be primarily confined to mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints or skin irritations. Quality of the evidence   Most included trials were at low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence was mainly very low to moderate. A moderate grade of evidence was only found for  C. frutescens . Trials only tested the effects of short term use (up to six weeks). Authors of eight of the included trials had a potential conflict of interest and four other authors did not disclose conflicts of interest. Vioxx® has been withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects, so all three substances should be compared to readily‐available pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, for relative effectiveness and safety. Conclusion   Low to moderate quality evidence shows that four herbal medicines may reduce pain in acute and chronic LBP in the short‐term and have few side effects. There is no evidence yet that any of these substances are safe or efficacious for long‐term use. Large, well‐designed trials are needed to further test the efficacy of these interventions.",CD004504
"Background Maintenance intravenous fluids are frequently used in hospitalised children who cannot maintain adequate hydration through enteral intake. Traditionally used hypotonic fluids have been associated with hyponatraemia and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Use of isotonic fluid has been proposed to reduce complications. Objectives To establish and compare the risk of hyponatraemia by systematically reviewing studies where isotonic is compared with hypotonic intravenous fluid for maintenance purposes in children. Secondly, to compare the risk of hypernatraemia, the effect on mean serum sodium concentration and the rate of attributable adverse effects of both fluid types in children. Search methods We ran the search on 17 June 2013. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and ISI Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers and screened reference lists. We updated this search in October 2014 but these results have not yet been incorporated. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared isotonic versus hypotonic intravenous fluids for maintenance hydration in children. Data collection and analysis At least two authors assessed and extracted data for each trial. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean differences with 95% CIs. Main results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1106 patients. The majority of the studies were performed in surgical or intensive care populations (or both). There was considerable variation in the composition of intravenous fluid, particularly hypotonic fluid, used in the studies. There was a low risk of bias for most of the included studies. Ten studies provided data for our primary outcome, a total of 449 patients in the analysis received isotonic fluid, while 521 received hypotonic fluid. Those who received isotonic fluid had a substantially lower risk of hyponatraemia (17% versus 34%; RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.60, high quality evidence). It is unclear whether there is an increased risk of hypernatraemia when isotonic fluids are used (4% versus 3%; RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.38, nine studies, 937 participants, low quality evidence), although the absolute number of patients developing hypernatraemia was low. Most studies had safety restrictions included in their methodology, preventing detailed investigation of serious adverse events. Authors' conclusions Isotonic intravenous maintenance fluids with sodium concentrations similar to that of plasma reduce the risk of hyponatraemia when compared with hypotonic intravenous fluids. These results apply for the first 24 hours of administration in a wide group of primarily surgical paediatric patients with varying severities of illness.","Fluids for hydration in children Background Many children in hospital need fluid through an intravenous line (or 'drip') because they cannot eat or drink enough and they need to remain hydrated. This fluid can cause rare but serious side effects due to the salt level in the body decreasing. When the salt level in the body decreases quickly brain swelling can occur, which can result in death. There has been uncertainty regarding how much salt the intravenous fluid should contain. Review question Traditionally, fluids containing lower salt levels than blood (hypotonic) have been administered. This analysis compared these fluids with fluid containing a similar salt level to blood (isotonic). We aimed to determine how many patients had low salt levels in the blood when an isotonic fluid was used compared with a hypotonic fluid. Key results Studies conducted prior to 17 June 2013 were reviewed. We included 10 studies in the analysis, involving a total of 1106 children. When isotonic fluids were used, the sodium level in the body was less likely to be low. One hundred and sixty‐nine children per 1000 had low sodium levels in the blood when an isotonic fluid was given, compared with 338 children per 1000 when a hypotonic fluid was used. The results for serious adverse events associated with isotonic or hypotonic fluids were uncertain. This review mainly looked at patients who either had surgery and/or were in intensive care, with most only needing intravenous fluid for less than a day. Quality of the evidence The studies included were generally well conducted and were of a high quality.",CD009457
"Background In settings where both  Plasmodium vivax  and  Plasmodium falciparum  infection cause malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) need to distinguish which species is causing the patients' symptoms, as different treatments are required. Older RDTs incorporated two test lines to distinguish malaria due to  P. falciparum,  from malaria due to any other  Plasmodium  species (non‐falciparum). These RDTs can be classified according to which antibodies they use: Type 2 RDTs use HRP‐2 (for  P. falciparum ) and aldolase (all species); Type 3 RDTs use HRP‐2 (for  P. falciparum ) and pLDH (all species); Type 4 use pLDH (from P. falciparum ) and pLDH (all species). More recently, RDTs have been developed to distinguish  P. vivax  parasitaemia by utilizing a pLDH antibody specific to  P. vivax . Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting non‐falciparum or  P. vivax  parasitaemia in people living in malaria‐endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria, and to identify which types and brands of commercial test best detect non‐falciparum and  P. vivax  malaria. Search methods We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 31 December 2013: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web of Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; and IndMED. Selection criteria Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in non‐falciparum endemic areas. Data collection and analysis For each study, two review authors independently extracted a standard set of data using a tailored data extraction form. We grouped comparisons by type of RDT (defined by the combinations of antibodies used), and combined in meta‐analysis where appropriate. Average sensitivities and specificities are presented alongside 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Main results We included 47 studies enrolling 22,862 participants. Patient characteristics, sampling methods and reference standard methods were poorly reported in most studies. RDTs detecting 'non‐falciparum' parasitaemia Eleven studies evaluated Type 2 tests compared with microscopy, 25 evaluated Type 3 tests, and 11 evaluated Type 4 tests. In meta‐analyses, average sensitivities and specificities were 78% (95% CI 73% to 82%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 2 tests, 78% (95% CI 69% to 84%) and 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%) for Type 3 tests, and 89% (95% CI 79% to 95%) and 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%) for Type 4 tests, respectively. Type 4 tests were more sensitive than both Type 2 (P = 0.01) and Type 3 tests (P = 0.03). Five studies compared Type 3 tests with PCR; in meta‐analysis, the average sensitivity and specificity were 81% (95% CI 72% to 88%) and 99% (95% CI 97% to 99%) respectively. RDTs detecting P.vivax parasitaemia Eight studies compared pLDH tests to microscopy; the average sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI 86% to 99%) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%), respectively. Authors' conclusions   RDTs designed to detect  P. vivax  specifically, whether alone or as part of a mixed infection, appear to be more accurate than older tests designed to distinguish  P. falciparum  malaria from non‐falciparum malaria. Compared to microscopy, these tests fail to detect around 5% of P. vivax  cases. This Cochrane Review, in combination with other published information about in vitro test performance and stability in the field, can assist policy‐makers to choose between the available RDTs. 12 April 2019 No update planned Review superseded This Cochrane Review has been superseded by Choi 2019 https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013218","Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by  Plasmodium vivax  or other less common parasites This review summarises trials evaluating the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing malaria due to  Plasmodium vivax  or other non‐falciparum species. After searching for relevant studies up to December 2013, we included 47 studies, enrolling 22,862 adults and children. What are rapid tests and why do they need to be able to distinguish Plasmodium vivax malaria RDTs are simple to use, point of care tests, suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers. RDTs work by using antibodies to detect malaria antigens in the patient's blood. A drop of blood is placed on the test strip where the antibodies and antigen combine to create a distinct line indicating a positive test. Malaria can be caused any one of five species of  Plasmodium  parasite, but  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  are the most common. In some areas, RDTs need to be able to distinguish which species is causing the malaria symptoms as different species may require different treatments. Unlike  P. falciparum ,  P. vivax  has a liver stage which can cause repeated illness every few months unless it is treated with primaquine. The most common types of RDTs for  P. vivax  use two test lines in combination; one line specific to  P. falciparum,  and one line which can detect any species of Plasmodium. If the  P. falciparum  line is negative and the 'any species' line is positive, the illness is presumed to be due to  P. vivax  (but could also be caused by  P. malariae, or P. ovale ) .  More recently, RDTs have been developed which specifically test for  P. vivax. What does the research say RDTs testing for non‐falciparum malaria were very specific (range 98% to 100%) meaning that only 1% to 2% of patients who test positive would actually not have the disease. However, they were less sensitive (range 78% to 89%), meaning between 11% and 22% of people with non‐falciparum malaria would actually get a negative test result. RDTs which specifically tested for  P. vivax  were more accurate with a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 95%, meaning that only 5% of people with  P. vivax  malaria would have a negative test result.",CD011431
"Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2002 and previously updated in 2004, 2007 and 2010. Radiotherapy, open surgery and endolaryngeal excision (with or without laser) are all accepted modalities of treatment for early‐stage glottic cancer. Case series suggest that they confer a similar survival advantage, however radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery offer the advantage of voice preservation. There has been an observed trend away from open surgery in recent years, however equipoise remains between radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery as both treatment modalities offer laryngeal preservation with similar survival rates. Opinions on optimal therapy vary across disciplines and between countries. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of open surgery, endolaryngeal excision (with or without laser) and radiotherapy in the management of early glottic laryngeal cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 8); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 18 September 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing open surgery, endolaryngeal resection (with or without laser) and radiotherapy. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We identified only one randomised controlled trial, which compared open surgery and radiotherapy in 234 patients with early glottic laryngeal cancer. The overall risk of bias in this study was high. For T1 tumours, the five‐year survival was 91.7% following radiotherapy and 100% following surgery and for T2 tumours, 88.8% following radiotherapy and 97.4% following surgery. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. For T1 tumours, the five‐year disease‐free survival rate was 71.1% following radiotherapy and 100.0% following surgery, and for the T2 tumours, 60.1% following radiotherapy and 78.7% following surgery. Only the latter comparison was statistically significant (P value = 0.036), but statistical significance would not have been achieved with a two‐sided test. Data were not available on side effects, quality of life, voice outcomes or cost. We identified no randomised controlled trials that included endolaryngeal surgery. A number of trials comparing endolaryngeal resection and radiotherapy have terminated early because of difficulty recruiting participants. One randomised controlled trial is still ongoing. Authors' conclusions There is only one randomised controlled trial comparing open surgery and radiotherapy but its interpretation is limited because of concerns about the adequacy of treatment regimens and deficiencies in the reporting of the study design and analysis.","Radiotherapy versus open surgery versus endolaryngeal surgery (with or without laser) for early larynx cancer Background Cancer of the larynx or voice box usually begins in the glottis (vocal cords) as a squamous cell cancer (cancer in the membranes). Most people survive these cancers when they get treatment early, before the cancer spreads further into the larynx and surrounding area. Options include radiotherapy, open surgery where access is through the neck or, more commonly now, endolaryngeal excision whereby the throat is reached through the mouth, sometimes with a laser. Study characteristics This review of trials identified just one trial including 234 patients with early glottic cancer, which compared radiotherapy to open surgery. This was a multicentre randomised controlled trial undertaken in the former Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Patients were followed up for five years and recurrence‐free and survival rates were measured. Key results The results of this trial showed that there was no significant difference in survival between patients treated with radiotherapy or open surgery. Further data from trials comparing radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery are needed to determine the best way of treating early laryngeal cancer, however a number of studies have been abandoned because of difficulties in recruiting participants. One trial is still ongoing. We found that there is not enough evidence to show which form of treatment might be better for people with early‐stage larynx cancer. Quality of the evidence The included study is of low quality. The evidence in this review is up to date to September 2014.",CD002027
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2010, on droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with terminal illness and can be very unpleasant and distressing. There are several different types of antiemetic treatments that can be used to control these symptoms. Droperidol is an antipsychotic drug and has been used and studied as an antiemetic in the management of postoperative and chemotherapy nausea and vomiting. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (both minor and serious) associated with the use of droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. Search methods We searched electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1950‐), EMBASE (1980‐), CINAHL (1981‐) and AMED (1985‐), using relevant search terms and synonyms. The basic search strategy was (""droperidol"" OR ""butyrophenone"") AND (""nausea"" OR ""vomiting""), modified for each database. We updated the search on 2 December 2009. We performed updated searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and AMED 2009 to 2013 on 19 November 2013 and of CINAHL on 20 November 2013. We also searched trial registers ( meta Register of controlled trials (www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct), clinicaltrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/)) on 22 November 2013, using the keyword ""droperidol"". Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of droperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting, or both, in adults receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition. Data collection and analysis We judged the potential relevance of studies based on their titles and abstracts, and obtained studies that we anticipated might meet the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently reviewed the abstracts for the initial review and four review authors reviewed the abstracts for the update to assess suitability for inclusion. We discussed discrepancies to achieve consensus. Main results The 2010 search strategy identified 1664 abstracts (and 827 duplicates) of which we obtained 23 studies in full as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. On review of the full papers, we identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria. The updated searches carried out in November 2013 identified 304 abstracts (261 excluding duplicates) of which we obtained 18 references in full as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. On review of the full papers, we identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria, therefore there were no included studies in this review. We found no registered trials of droperidol for the management of nausea or vomiting in palliative care. Authors' conclusions Since first publication of this review, no new studies were found. There is insufficient evidence to advise on the use of droperidol for the management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care. Studies of antiemetics in palliative care settings are needed to identify which agents are most effective, with minimum side effects.","Droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting (sickness) in people with advanced disease Nausea (a feeling of sickness) and vomiting are common and distressing symptoms for people with advanced cancer and other life‐threatening illnesses. Several medications to control these symptoms are available. Droperidol is one example, which has been used to try to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting for people having surgery or chemotherapy. In our search updated in November 2013 we found no randomised studies of droperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting for people receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition. Several studies reported on the use of droperidol for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to find out which medications are most suitable to treat nausea and vomiting in palliative care.",CD006938
"Background The choice of surgical approach for the management of subaxial cervical spine facet dislocations is a controversial subject amongst spine surgeons. Reasons for this include differences in the technical familiarity and experience of surgeons with the different surgical approaches, and variable interpretation of image studies regarding the existence of a traumatic intervertebral disc herniation and of the neurological status of the patient. Moreover, since the approaches are dissimilar, important variations are likely in neurological, radiographical and clinical outcomes. Objectives To compare the effects (benefits and harms) of the different surgical approaches used for treating adults with acute cervical spine facet dislocation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (9 May 2014), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , 2014 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to April Week 5 2014), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (8 May 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 18), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (9 May 2014), trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles to May 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared surgical approaches for the management of adults with acute cervical spine facet dislocations with and without spinal cord injury. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included one randomised and one quasi‐randomised controlled trial involving a total of 94 participants and reporting results for a maximum of 84 participants. One trial included patients with spinal cord injuries and the other included patients without spinal cord injuries. Both trials compared anterior versus posterior surgical approaches. Both trials were at high risk of bias, including selection bias (one trial), performance bias (both trials) and attrition bias (one trial). Data were pooled for one outcome only: non‐union. Reflecting also the imprecision of the results, the evidence was deemed to be of very low quality for all outcomes; which means that our level of uncertainty about the estimates is high. Neither trial found differences between the two approaches in neurological recovery or status, as shown in one study by small clinically insignificant differences in NASS (Northern American Spine Society) neurological scores (0 to 100: optimal score) at one year of follow‐up: anterior mean score: 85.23 versus posterior mean score: 83.86; mean difference (MD) 1.37 favouring anterior approach, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.76 to 12.50; 33 participants; 1 study). The same trial found no relevant between‐approach differences at one year in patient‐reported quality of life measured using the 36‐item Short Form Survey physical (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐7.26 to 7.10) and mental component scores (MD 2.88, 95% CI ‐3.32 to 9.08). Neither trial found evidence of significant differences in long‐term pain, or non‐union (2/38 versus 2/46; risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 34.91). One trial found better sagittal and more 'normal' alignment after the anterior approach (MD ‐10.31 degrees favouring anterior approach, 95% CI ‐14.95 degrees to ‐5.67 degrees), while the other trial reported no significant differences in cervical alignment. There was insufficient evidence to indicate between‐group differences in medical adverse events, rates of instrumentation failure and infection. One trial found that the several participants had voice and swallowing disorders after anterior approach surgery (11/20) versus none (0/22) in the posterior approach group: RR 25.19, 95% CI 1.58 to 401.58); all had recovered by three months. Authors' conclusions Very low quality evidence from two trials indicated little difference in long‐term neurological status, pain or patient‐reported quality of life between anterior and posterior surgical approaches to the management of individuals with subaxial cervical spine facet dislocations. Sagittal alignment may be better achieved with the anterior approach. There was insufficient evidence available to indicate between‐group differences in medical adverse events, rates of instrumentation failure and infection. The disorders of the voice and swallowing that occurred exclusively in the anterior approach group all resolved by three months. We are very uncertain about this evidence and thus we cannot say whether one approach is better than the other. There was no evidence available for other approaches. Further higher quality multicentre randomised trials are warranted.","Surgical approaches for dislocations of the neck bones The part of the back bone found in the neck is called the cervical spine. It consists of seven bones (or vertebrae). The relative movement of these vertebrae is mainly via small joints (called facet joints) located between each vertebrae. The facet joints in the cervical spine facilitate good movement of the neck, but they are vulnerable to dislocation. Typically, cervical spine facet dislocations are caused by high‐energy traumas such as road traffic accidents or violent attacks. Approximately half of people with such dislocations sustain an injury to the spinal cord carried within the spine. This can result in significant impairment of function (e.g. paralysis). Surgery is usually needed for these serious injuries in order to keep the neck bones in place. What are the different surgical approaches?   There are two main stages to surgery: reduction and fixation. Reduction is the restoration of an injured or dislocated bone or joint to its normal anatomical position, and can be achieved either with surgery or through closed reduction, which is performed with traction or manipulation. Fixation is the medical procedure used to stabilise one or more joints, or a fractured bone, usually by surgically inserting devices such as wires, screws, plates and rods. Fixation of the injury is generally accomplished by either an anterior or posterior surgical approach. With an anterior cervical approach the surgery is performed through an incision over the front surface of the neck, while the posterior cervical approach consists of a lengthwise midline incision over the back part of the neck and dissection through muscle to the cervical vertebrae. This approach gives direct access to the dislocated facet joints. Description of the studies included in the review   We searched the medical literature until May 2014 and found two relevant studies that included a total of 94 adults with cervical spine facet dislocations. One trial included individuals with spinal cord injuries and the other included individuals without spinal cord injuries. Both studies compared the anterior versus posterior surgical approach. Quality of the evidence   The two studies were small and both were at high risk of bias. We therefore judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. Summary of the evidence     Neither study found differences between the two approaches in neurological status and pain at one year. One study also found no differences between the two approaches in patient‐reported quality of life. Although one study found that the anterior approach resulted in more normal curvature of the neck, the other study reported finding no difference between the two approaches with regard to the alignment of the neck vertebrae. The evidence was insufficient to indicate differences between the two approaches in medical adverse events, rates of instrumentation failure and infection. Although over half (11) of 20 people in the anterior approach group in one study had voice and swallowing disorders, these all resolved by three months. Conclusion   The quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the direction and size of effect. Thus we are unable to say whether either an anterior or posterior approach to the surgical management of individuals with dislocations to the cervical spine facet joints is better than the other. We suggest that further research is needed to inform the choice of surgical approach.",CD008129
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2010 (Issue 7). Carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the second most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death among women. Radiotherapy has been used successfully to treat cervical cancer for nearly a century. The combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intracavity brachytherapy (ICBT) has become a standard treatment for cervical cancer. Whether high dose rate (HDR) or low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy improves outcomes in terms of local control rates, survival and complications for women with cervical cancer remains controversial. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of HDR versus LDR ICBT in combination with EBRT for women with uterine cervical cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1974 to March 2014), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to March 2014) for relevant original, published trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared HDR with LDR ICBT, combined with EBRT, for women with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data using standardised forms. Primary outcome measures included overall survival (OS), relapse‐free survival (RFS) and pelvic control rate, while secondary outcomes included rates of recurrence and complications. Main results Four studies involving 1265 women met the inclusion criteria. In our meta‐analysis to compare HDR and LDR ICBT, the pooled risk ratios (RRs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.15), 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.04) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.20) for 3‐, 5‐ and 10‐year overall survival rates respectively; and 0.95 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) and 1.02 (0.88 to 1.19) for 5‐ and 10‐year disease‐specific survival (DSS) rates respectively. The RR for RFS was 1.04 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.52) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.14) at 3‐ and 5‐ years. For local control rates the RR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.05) at 3‐ and 5‐ years; with a RR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.43) for locoregional recurrence, 0.79 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.53) for local and distant recurrence, 2.23 (95% CI 0.78 to 6.34) for para‐aortic lymph node metastasis, and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.35) for distance metastasis. For bladder, rectosigmoid and small bowel complications, the RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.34), 1.00 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.91) and 3.37 (95% CI 1.06 to 10.72) respectively. These results indicated that there were no significant differences except for increased small bowel complications with HDRs (P = 0.04). Authors' conclusions Since the last version of this review, no new studies were identified for inclusion in this review to provide additional information. This review showed no significant differences between HDR and LDR ICBT when considering OS, DSS, RFS, local control rate, recurrence, metastasis and treatment related complications for women with cervical carcinoma. Due to some potential advantages of HDR ICBT (rigid immobilization, outpatient treatment, patient convenience, accuracy of source and applicator positioning, individualized treatment) we recommend the use of HDR ICBT for all clinical stages of cervix cancer. The overall risk of bias was high for the included studies as many of the items were either of high or unclear risk. The GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.","High dose rate versus low dose rate intracavity brachytherapy for locally advanced uterine cervix cancer Background Radiotherapy has been successfully used to treat cervical cancer for nearly a century as cervical tissue is very sensitive to radiation. Improved survival and local control rates of the disease have made the combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intracavity brachytherapy (ICBT) the standard treatment for locally advanced uterine cervix cancer. ICBT is divided into three modalities, low dose rate (LDR), high dose rate (HDR), and medium dose rate (MDR). Many studies have concluded that the LDR was superior to the HDR as the post‐treatment repair of normal tissue was better. Nevertheless, due to some potential advantages of HDRs in modern afterloading ICBT, HDR ICBT has increasingly been used, instead of LDR ICBT, over the past 20 years. Review question Despite the practical advantages of HDR, controversy still persists regarding the efficacy and safety of HDR compared to LDR brachytherapy. We conducted this review to assess the efficacy and safety of HDR versus LDR ICBT for women with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Main findings Four studies involving 1265 women were included in our meta‐analysis to compare HDR and LDR ICBT. The pooled results indicated there were no significant difference with regard to 3‐, 5‐ and 10‐year overall survival rates; 5‐ and 10‐year disease‐specific survival rates; 3‐ and 5‐year relapse‐free survival; 3‐ and 5‐year local control rates; and local and distant recurrence. Only in respect to complications did HDR ICBTshow mildly increased numbers of small bowel complications. These results confirmed that there were no significant differences in the efficacy and safety of HDR versus LDR ICBT for women with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Quality of the evidence We included three randomised controlled trials and one quasi‐randomised controlled trial. The way that randomisation was carried out was described in only two trials but they did not give details regarding allocation concealment and blinding. However, all trials had a low risk bias for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias). The different methodological approaches used in the trials prevented any clear conclusion being reached regarding the quality of the evidence. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.",CD007563
"Background Anaemia occurs when blood contains fewer red blood cells and lower haemoglobin levels than normal, and is a common complication among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although a number of approaches are applied to correct anaemia in adults with CKD, the use of androgen therapy is controversial. Objectives The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and harms of androgens for the treatment of anaemia in adult patients with CKD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM), CNKI, VIP and reference lists of articles without language restriction. The most recent search was conducted in August 2014. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the use of androgens for treating anaemia of CKD in adults were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. Meta‐analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included eight studies that reported data from 181 participants. Study quality was assessed as moderate in six studies, one was low quality, and one was high quality. The small number of included studies, and low participant numbers adversely influenced evidence quality overall. We found limited evidence (1 study, 24 participants) to indicate that oxymetholone can increase haemoglobin (Hb) (MD 1.90 g/dL, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.14), haematocrit (HCT) (MD 27.10%, 95% CI 26.49 to 27.71), change in albumin (MD 4.91 g/L, 95% CI 3.69 to 6.13), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MD 54.50 U/L, 95% CI 43.94 to 65.06), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD 47.33 U/L, 95% CI 37.69 to 56.97); and decrease high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD ‐15.66 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐24.84 to ‐6.48). We also found that compared with erythropoietin alone, nandrolone decanoate plus erythropoietin may increase HCT (3 studies, 73 participants: MD 2.54%, 95% Cl 0.96 to 4.12). Compared with erythropoietin (1 study, 27 participants), limited evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase plasma total protein (MD 0.40 g/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67), albumin (MD 0.20 g/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39), and transferrin (MD 45.00 mg/dL, 95% CI 12.61 to 77.39) levels. Compared with no therapy (remnant kidney), evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (2 studies, 33 participants: MD 1.04 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.66 to 1.41) and HCT (1 study, 24 participants: MD 3.70%, 95% Cl 0.68 to 6.72). Compared with no therapy (anephric), evidence was found (1 study, 5 participants) to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (MD 1.30 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.57 to 2.03), but nandrolone decanoate did not increase HCT (MD 2.00%, 95% Cl ‐0.85 to 4.85). However, oxymetholone was not found to reduce blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), cholesterol, or triglycerides; or increase plasma total protein, prealbumin, or transferrin. No evidence was found to indicate that nandrolone decanoate increased prealbumin or decreased BUN, SCr, AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL or low‐density lipoprotein (LDL). Adverse events associated with androgen therapy were reported infrequently. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to confirm that use of androgens for adults with CKD‐related anaemia is beneficial.","Androgens for the anaemia of chronic kidney disease in adults Anaemia, which occurs when red blood cell and haemoglobin levels fall below normal, is a common problem among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anaemia can cause breathlessness, dizziness and chest pain (angina); reduce ability to think clearly; limits ability to exercise; and contributes to sexual problems, poor appetite and reduced quality of life. Anaemia may also cause longer hospital stays, and sometimes death. There are several approaches to correct anaemia in people with CKD, including drugs to stimulate red blood cell production, dialysis to remove waste and excess water from the blood, blood transfusions, dietary management, and supplementary iron and folate agents. Other drugs, such as androgens ‐ which are male steroid hormones ‐ may be given in some settings to help reduce undesirable effects of treatments. Another possible benefit of androgen therapy for people with CKD, especially in regions with limited health resources, is that these drugs have lower costs than some other treatments. We assessed eight small studies that presented data from 181 adults with CKD‐related anaemia that investigated use of androgen therapy. Limitations and flaws in the evidence lead to our conclusion that androgen therapy for adults with CKD‐related anaemia was not associated with substantial benefits.",CD006881
"Background Incontinence after prostatectomy for benign or malignant disease is a well‐known and often a feared outcome. Although small degrees of incidental incontinence may go virtually unnoticed, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life. Conceptually, post‐prostatectomy incontinence may be caused by sphincter malfunction or bladder dysfunction, or both. Most men with post‐prostatectomy incontinence (60% to 100%) have stress urinary incontinence, which is involuntary urinary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. This may be due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency and may be treated with surgery for optimal management of incontinence. Detrusor dysfunction is more common after surgery for benign prostatic disease. Objectives To determine the effects of surgical treatment for urinary incontinence related to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery for: ‐ men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) ‐ transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), photo vaporisation of the prostate, laser enucleation of the prostate or open prostatectomy ‐ and ‐ men with prostate cancer ‐ radical prostatectomy (retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic, or robotic). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 31 March 2014); MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2014); EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2014); and LILACS (January 1982 to April 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. We contacted investigators to locate studies. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials that include surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the trials identified, appraised quality of papers, and extracted data. Main results Only one study with 45 participants met the inclusion criteria. Men were divided in two sub‐groups (minimal or total incontinence) and each group was randomised to artificial urethral sphincter (AUS) implantation or Macroplastique injection. Follow‐up ranged from six to 120 months. In the trial as a whole, the men treated with AUS were more likely to be dry (18/20, 82%) than those who had the injectable treatment (11/23, 46%) (odds ratio (OR) 5.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 25.10). However, this effect was only statistically significant for the men with more severe ('total') incontinence (OR 8.89, 95% CI 1.40 to 56.57) and the CIs were wide. There were more severe complications in the group undergoing AUS, and the costs were higher. AUS implantation was complicated in 5/22 (23%) men: the implant had to be removed from one man because of infection and in one man due to the erosion of the cuff, in one man the pump was changed due to mechanical failure, in one man there was migration to the intraperitoneal region, and one man experienced scrotal erosion. In the injectable group, 3/23 (13%) men had a complication: one man treated with Macroplastique injection had to be catheterised because of urinary retention and two men developed urinary tract infections. Authors' conclusions The evidence available at present was of very low quality because we identified only one small randomised clinical trial. Although the result was favourable for the implantation of AUS in the group with severe incontinence, this result should be considered with caution due to the small sample size and uncertain methodological quality of the study found.","Surgery for urinary incontinence due to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery Background Urinary leakage (incontinence) after surgery to remove the prostate (prostatectomy) for benign or malignant disease is a well‐known and often feared outcome. Although a small amount of incontinence may not cause a problem, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life. Improvement in urinary leakage may occur six to 12 months after the prostatic surgery, but for men with persistent bothersome leakage despite conservative therapy such as pelvic floor exercises, surgery may be offered. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for trials that had considered the effectiveness of the surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery in men. The trials had to compare surgical treatment versus no treatment, non‐surgical treatment, or another surgical treatment. The evidence is current to April 2014. Key results and quality of the evidence There are five main types of surgery and, despite some of them being in use since the 1990s, we found only one trial that met the inclusion criteria. There was very low quality evidence that the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (a manufactured device to prevent urine leaking out) might be more effective than injectable treatment, but with more adverse effects and higher costs. There was no evidence about the other types of surgery.",CD008306
"Background Chronic cough (a cough lasting longer than four weeks) is a common problem internationally. Chronic cough has associated economic costs and is distressing to the child and to parents; ignoring cough may lead to delayed diagnosis and progression of serious underlying respiratory disease. Clinical guidelines have been shown to lead to efficient and effective patient care and can facilitate clinical decision making. Cough guidelines have been designed to facilitate the management of chronic cough. However, treatment recommendations vary, and specific clinical pathways for the treatment of chronic cough in children are important, as causes of and treatments for cough vary significantly from those in adults. Therefore, systematic evaluation of the use of evidence‐based clinical pathways for the management of chronic cough in children would be beneficial for clinical practice and for patient care. Use of a management algorithm can improve clinical outcomes; such management guidelines can be found in the guidelines for cough provided by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS). Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of using a clinical pathway in the management of children with chronic cough. Search methods The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest search was conducted in January 2014. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of parallel‐group design comparing use versus non‐use of a clinical pathway for treatment of chronic cough in children (< 18 years of age). Data collection and analysis Results of searches were reviewed against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction in duplicate. Main results One study was included in the review. This multi‐centre trial was based in five Australian hospitals and recruited 272 children with chronic cough. Children were randomly assigned to early (two weeks) or delayed (six weeks) referral to respiratory specialists who used a cough management pathway. When an intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed, clinical failure at six weeks post randomisation (defined as < 75% improvement in cough score, or total resolution for fewer than three consecutive days) was significantly less in the early pathway arm compared with the control arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.58). These results indicate that one additional child will be cured for every five children treated via the cough pathway (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5, 95% CI 3 to 9) at six weeks. Cough‐specific parent‐reported quality of life scores were significantly better in the early‐pathway group; the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.01). Duration of cough post randomisation was significantly shorter in the intervention group (early‐pathway arm) compared with the control group (delayed‐pathway arm) (MD ‐2.70 weeks, 95% CI ‐4.26 to ‐1.14). Authors' conclusions Current evidence suggests that using a clinical algorithm for the management of children with chronic cough in hospital outpatient settings is more effective than providing wait‐list care. Futher high‐quality randomised controlled trials are needed to perform ongoing evaluation of cough management pathways in general practitioner and other primary care settings.","Clinical pathways for chronic cough in children Background Clinical pathways serve as a tool or algorithm (like a flow chart) that can be used in the treatment of patients with various chronic diseases. They provide a clear guide that assists doctors in diagnosing an illness and in making decisions with the patient about what treatment is needed or which specialists should be seen or tests ordered at each stage of progression of the disease. Overall the aim of clinical pathways is to provide efficient care for patients. Examples of patient decision aids are provided by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK at http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/shared‐decision‐making/about‐the‐pdas/. Chronic cough in children is a significant medical problem that in some situations warrants thorough investigation. This review examined whether using clinical pathways was effective for evaluating and managing children with chronic cough (cough lasting longer than 4 weeks). Study characteristics Only a single multi‐centre study could be included in this review. Evidence is current to January 2014. This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Key results This study of 272 children in five Australian hospitals reported that those randomly assigned to earlier treatment according to a clinical pathway showed improved clinical outcomes (cough resolved earlier and quality of life was better) compared with those who were randomly assigned to later use of the pathway. No adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence was graded as moderate. Evidence is limited, as only one study could be included in this review. This study was unable to completely blind participants to the clinical pathway.",CD006595
"Background Pancreas or kidney‐pancreas transplantation improves survival and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and kidney failure. Immunosuppression after transplantation is associated with complications. Steroids have adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia, increase risk of infection, obesity, cataracts, myopathy, bone metabolism alterations, dermatologic problems and cushingoid appearance. Whether avoiding steroids changes outcomes is unclear. Objectives We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of steroid early withdrawal (treatment for less than 14 days after transplantation), late withdrawal (after 14 days after transplantation) or steroid avoidance in patients receiving a pancreas (including a vascularized organ) alone (PTA), simultaneous with a kidney (SPK) or after kidney transplantation (PAK). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 June 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator. We handsearched: reference lists of nephrology textbooks, relevant studies, recent publications and clinical practice guidelines; abstracts from international transplantation society scientific meetings; and sent emails and letters seeking information about unpublished or incomplete studies to known investigators. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies of steroid avoidance (including early withdrawal) versus steroid maintenance or versus late withdrawal in pancreas or pancreas with kidney transplant recipients. We defined steroid avoidance as complete avoidance of steroid immunosuppression, early steroid withdrawal as steroid treatment for less than 14 days after transplantation and late withdrawal as steroid withdrawal after 14 days after transplantation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts, and where necessary the full text reports to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Authors of included studies were contacted to obtain missing information. Statistical analyses were performed using random effects models and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Cohort studies were not meta‐analysed, but their findings summarised descriptively. Main results Three RCTs enrolling 144 participants met our inclusion criteria. Two compared steroid avoidance versus late steroid withdrawal and one compared late steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance. All studies included SPK and only one also included PTA. All studies had an overall moderate risk of bias and presented only short‐term results (six to 12 months). Two studies (89 participants) compared steroid avoidance or early steroid withdrawal versus late steroid withdrawal. There was no clear evidence of an impact on mortality (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 12.75), risk of kidney loss censored for death (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.09), risk of pancreas loss censored for death (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.04), or acute kidney rejection (1 study, 49 participants: RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.20 to 21.50), however results were uncertain and consistent with no difference or important benefit or harm of steroid avoidance/early steroid withdrawal. The study that compared late steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance observed no deaths, no graft loss or acute kidney rejection at six months in either group and reported uncertain effects on acute pancreas rejection (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.35). Of the possible adverse effects only infection was reported by one study. There were significantly more UTIs reported in the late withdrawal group compared to the steroid avoidance group (1 study, 25 patients: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66). We also identified 13 cohort studies and one RCT which randomised tacrolimus versus cyclosporin. These studies in general showed that steroid‐sparing and withdrawal strategies had benefits in lowering HbAc1 and risk of infections (BK virus and CMV disease) and improved blood pressure control without increasing the risk of rejection. However, two studies found an increased incidence of acute pancreas rejection (HR 2.8, 95% CI 0.89 to 8.81, P = 0.066 in one study and 43.3% in the steroid withdrawal group versus 9.3% in the steroid maintenance, P < 0.05 at three years in the other) and one study found an increased incidence of acute kidney rejection (18.7% in the steroid withdrawal group versus 2.8% in the steroid maintenance, P < 0.05) at three years. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence for the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal in pancreas transplantation in the three RCTs (144 patients) identified. The results showed uncertain results for short‐term risk of rejection, mortality, or graft survival in steroid‐sparing strategies in a very small number of patients over a short period of follow‐up. Overall the data was sparse, so no firm conclusions are possible. Moreover, the 13 observational studies findings generally concur with the evidence found in the RCTs.","Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for pancreas and pancreas with kidney transplant recipients People with type 1 diabetes and kidney failure have a poor survival. In the clinical course, they suffer from several diabetic vascular complications and usually have progressive kidney impairment. Pancreas transplantation improves survival and quality of life and controls blood glucose without the need for insulin therapy, making pancreas with kidney transplantation the treatment of choice in most patients with type 1 insulin‐dependent diabetes and kidney failure. More than 95% of transplant recipients are treated with steroids as part of their immunosuppression. Steroid treatment has complications including: hypertension, hyperglycaemia or hyperlipidaemia, increase risk of infection, obesity, cataracts, muscle disease, bone metabolism alterations and skin problems. However, without adequate immunosuppression, transplant patients are at risk of transplant rejection and transplant failure. This review looked at two strategies ‐ steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal ‐ to investigate their impact on short‐ and long‐term outcomes. These strategies could be used in adults in the first few days after transplantation when used in combination with more powerful immunosuppressive agents. Twenty‐one studies were identified and evaluated in this review although only three RCTs enrolling 144 participants met our inclusion criteria. Steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal strategies in pancreas and pancreas with kidney transplantation were not apparently associated with increased mortality, graft loss or acute rejection, although more studies are needed.",CD007669
"Background Automated systems use closed‐loop control to enable ventilators to perform basic and advanced functions while supporting respiration. SmartCare™ is a unique automated weaning system that measures selected respiratory variables, adapts ventilator output to individual patient needs by operationalizing predetermined algorithms and automatically conducts spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) when predetermined thresholds are met. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to compare weaning time (time from randomization to extubation as defined by study authors) between invasively ventilated critically ill adults weaned by automated weaning and SBT systems versus non‐automated weaning strategies. As secondary objectives, we ascertained differences between effects of alternative weaning strategies on clinical outcomes (time to successful extubation, time to first SBT and first successful SBT, mortality, ventilator‐associated pneumonia, total duration of ventilation, lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, use of non‐invasive ventilation (NIV), adverse events and clinician acceptance). The third objective of our review was to use subgroup analyses to explore variations in weaning time, length of ICU stay, mortality, ventilator‐associated pneumonia, use of NIV and reintubation according to (1) the type of clinician primarily involved in implementing the automated weaning and SBT strategy, (2) the ICU (as a reflection of the population involved) and (3) the non‐automated (control) weaning strategy utilized. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate variations in weaning time based on (4) the methodological quality (low or unclear versus high risk of bias) of the included studies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 5; MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2013); EMBASE (1988 to 31 May 2013); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 31 May 2013), Evidence‐Based Medicine Reviews and Ovid HealthSTAR (1999 to 31 May 2013), as well as conference proceedings and trial registration websites; we also contacted study authors and content experts to identify potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials comparing automated weaning and SBT systems versus non‐automated weaning strategies in intubated adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were planned to assess the impact on selected outcomes of the following: (1) the type of clinician primarily involved in implementing automated weaning and SBT systems, (2) the ICU (as a reflection of the population involved) and (3) the non‐automated (control) weaning strategy utilized. Main results We pooled summary estimates from 10 trials evaluating SmartCare™ involving 654 participants. Overall, eight trials were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and two trials were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared with non‐automated strategies, SmartCare™ decreased weaning time (mean difference (MD) ‐2.68 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.99 to ‐1.37; P value < 0.0001, seven trials, 495 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), time to successful extubation (MD ‐0.99 days, 95% CI ‐1.89 to ‐0.09; P value 0.03, seven trials, 516 participants, low‐quality evidence), length of ICU stay (MD ‐5.70 days, 95% CI ‐10.54 to ‐0.85; P value 0.02, six trials, 499 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) and proportions of participants receiving ventilation for longer than seven and 21 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; P value 0.01 and RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86; P value 0.02). SmartCare™ reduced the total duration of ventilation (MD ‐1.68 days, 95% CI ‐3.33 to ‐0.03; P value 0.05, seven trials, 521 participants, low‐quality evidence) and the number of participants receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.00; P value 0.05); however the estimated effects were imprecise. SmartCare™ had no effect on time to first successful SBT, mortality or adverse events, specifically reintubation. Subgroup analysis suggested that trials with protocolized (versus non‐protocolized) control weaning strategies reported significantly shorter ICU stays. Sensitivity analysis excluded two trials with high risk of bias and supported a trend toward significant reductions in weaning time favouring SmartCare™. Authors' conclusions Compared with non‐automated weaning strategies, weaning with SmartCare™ significantly decreased weaning time, time to successful extubation, ICU stay and proportions of patients receiving ventilation for longer than seven days and 21 days. It also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days; however the estimated effect was imprecise. Summary estimates from our review suggest that these benefits may be achieved without increasing the risk of adverse events, especially reintubation; however, the quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate, and evidence was derived from 10 small randomized controlled trials.","SmartCare™ versus non‐automated weaning strategies for weaning time in invasively ventilated critically ill adults The process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation is known as weaning. During weaning, the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator to the patient. Weaning is typically achieved by clinicians reducing ventilator support and/or conducting tests to determine whether a patient can breathe on his/her own. SmartCare™ is a unique system that automates this process by measuring selected respiratory variables, adapting ventilator output to meet individual patient needs and automatically conducting tests of spontaneous breathing to determine the earliest time when patients can breathe on their own. We identified 10 trials of moderate quality involving 654 participants and comparing SmartCare™ versus non‐automated weaning strategies. Compared with non‐automated strategies, SmartCare™ significantly decreased weaning time, time to successful removal from breathing machines and time spent in the ICU, with fewer patients receiving breathing machine support for longer than seven days and 21 days, and no increase in adverse events. SmartCare™ also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days, with no increase in adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggested more beneficial effects on weaning time in trials comparing SmartCare™ to a protocolized weaning strategy versus a non‐protocolized control strategy. Sensitivity analyses, which excluded two trials with high risk of bias, supported significant reductions in weaning time with SmartCare™.",CD008638
"Background One of the most important adverse effects of anthracyclines is cardiotoxicity. A well‐informed decision on the use of anthracyclines in the treatment of childhood cancers should be based on evidence regarding both antitumour efficacy and cardiotoxicity. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives To compare antitumour efficacy (survival and tumour response) and cardiotoxicity of treatment including or not including anthracyclines in children with childhood cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2013). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings, the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2002 to 2012) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2002 to 2013). We have searched for ongoing trials in the ISRCTN register and the National Institute of Health register (both screened August 2013) ( http://www.controlled‐trials.com ). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without anthracyclines and reporting outcomes concerning antitumour efficacy or cardiotoxicity. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Main results We identified RCTs for seven types of tumour, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (three trials; 912 children), Wilms' tumour (one trial; 316 children), rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma (one trial; 413 children), Ewing's sarcoma (one trial; 94 children), non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (one trial; 284 children), hepatoblastoma (one trial; 255 children) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (one trial; 394 children). All studies had methodological limitations. For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in antitumour efficacy was identified in the meta‐analyses, but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better antitumour efficacy in patients treated with anthracyclines. For both Wilms' tumour and Ewing's sarcoma a significant difference in event‐free and overall survival in favour of treatment with anthracyclines was identified, although for Wilms' tumour the significant difference in overall survival disappeared with long‐term follow‐up. For rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatoblastoma no difference in antitumour efficacy between the treatment groups was identified. The same was true for AML, with the exception of overall survival in a post hoc analysis in a subgroup of patients with relapsed core binding factor (CBF)‐AML in which patients treated with anthracyclines did better. Clinical cardiotoxicity was evaluated in four RCTs; no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical cardiotoxicity in patients who did not receive anthracyclines. None of the studies evaluated asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. No RCTs were identified for other childhood cancers. Authors' conclusions At the moment no evidence from RCTs is available which underscores the use of anthracyclines in ALL. However, 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatoblastoma and AML only one RCT was available for each type and, therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified and therefore no conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours.","Treatment with or without anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer Anthracyclines are used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. Unfortunately, one of the most important adverse effects of anthracyclines is damage to the heart. This can become manifest not only during treatment but also years after the end of treatment. A well‐informed decision on the use of anthracyclines in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer should be based on the available evidence on both the antitumour effects of anthracyclines and the risk of damage to the heart. This systematic review focused on randomised studies evaluating the antitumour effects of anthracycline therapy. The authors found that at the moment no high quality evidence is available which shows that the use of anthracyclines has an increased antitumour effect in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) as compared to treatment without anthracyclines, but there was some suggestion that this might be the case. Further high quality studies are needed to provide a definitive conclusion. For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatoblastoma and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the review authors found only limited data and were unable to draw conclusions. Also, there were no data for other childhood cancers. More high quality research is needed. At the moment there are five ongoing or unpublished randomised studies evaluating the use of anthracyclines in the following types of childhood cancer, hepatoblastoma, ALL (two studies), rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms' tumour.",CD006647
"Background Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long‐term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti‐inflammatory agents. Objectives To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration. Search methods We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate‐quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66). FEV 1 , measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD ‐1.22 days; 95% CI ‐2.26 to ‐0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94). Authors' conclusions There is high‐quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.","Do systemic corticosteroids improve treatment outcomes in flare‐ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Why is this question important? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also referred to as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, is a long‐term lung condition commonly associated with smoking. People with COPD usually have persistent symptoms of breathlessness and may experience flare‐ups (exacerbations) on occasion, often precipitated by infection, in which symptoms become markedly worse and further medical intervention is required beyond regular treatment by inhalers. Systemic (i.e. not inhaled corticosteroids) such as prednisolone, prednisone and cortisone, are anti‐inflammatory drugs commonly used in the treatment of exacerbations. We wanted to assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids and whether different routes of administration have impacts on response to treatment of COPD exacerbations. How did we answer the question? We looked for all studies that compared corticosteroid, given either by injections (parenterally) or tablets (orally), with matching dummy injections or tablets and all studies that compared corticosteroid given by injections with corticosteroid given by tablets. What did we find? We found 16 studies including over 1700 people with COPD who experienced a flare‐up that required additional medical treatment that compared corticosteroid given by injections or tablets with dummy treatment. Four studies with nearly 300 people compared corticosteroid injections with corticosteroid tablets. More men than women took part in the studies and they were usually in their late 60s, with moderately severe symptoms of COPD. Most studies took place in hospitals, two in intensive care units with people who needed breathing support, and three studies involved people who were treated at home. The last search for studies to include in the review was done in May 2014. There were three studies where people knew which treatment they were getting, but otherwise studies were generally well designed. People treated with either corticosteroid injections or tablets compared with dummy treatment were less likely to experience treatment failure, 122 fewer people per 1000 treated, with a lower rate of relapse by one month. They had shorter stays in hospital if they did not require assisted ventilation in an intensive care unit, and their lung function and breathlessness improved more quickly during treatment. However, they had more adverse events while taking treatment, especially a temporary increase in glucose levels in blood. Corticosteroid treatment did not reduce the number of people who died within one month of their flare‐up. In studies comparing two ways of giving corticosteroid, either by injections or tablets, there were no differences in treatment failure, the time in hospital or number of deaths after discharge; however, a temporary increase in glucose levels in blood was more likely with injections than tablets. Conclusion There is high‐quality evidence that is unlikely to be changed by future research that people who experience flare‐ups of COPD benefit from treatment with corticosteroid given by injections or tablets with the increased risk of some temporary side effects.",CD001288
"Background Inhaled anticholinergics given in addition to β 2 ‐agonists are effective in reducing hospital admissions in children presenting to the emergency department with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. It seems logical to assume a similar beneficial effect in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of anticholinergics added to β 2 ‐agonists as inhaled or nebulised therapy in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. To investigate the characteristics of patients or therapy, if any, that would influence the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of anticholinergics. Search methods We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. The search is current to November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing the combination of inhaled or nebulised anticholinergics and short‐acting β 2 ‐agonists versus short‐acting β 2 ‐agonists alone in children one to 18 years of age hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation were eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted data; disagreement was resolved by consensus or with the input of a third review author, when needed. Primary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included admission and duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), ventilation assistance, time to short‐acting β 2 ‐agonists spaced at four hours or longer, supplemental asthma therapy, duration of supplemental oxygen, change from baseline in asthma severity, relapse after discharge, adverse health effects and withdrawals. Main results Seven randomised trials were included, four of which reported usable data on 472 children with asthma one to 18 years of age who were admitted to paediatric wards. No trials included patients admitted to the ICU. The anticholinergic used, ipratropium bromide 250 μg, was given every one to eight hours over a period from four hours to the entire length of the hospital stay. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. The addition of anticholinergics to β 2 ‐agonists showed no evidence of effect on the duration of hospital admission (mean difference (MD) ‐0.28 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.07 to 4.52, 3 studies, 327 participants, moderate quality evidence) and no serious or non‐serious adverse events were reported in any included trials. As a result of the similarity of trials, we could not explore the influence of age, admission site, intensity of anticholinergic treatment and co‐interventions on primary outcomes. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other secondary outcomes, including the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short‐acting β 2 ‐agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. Authors' conclusions In children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, no evidence of benefit for length of hospital stay and other markers of response to therapy was noted when nebulised anticholinergics were added to short‐acting β 2 ‐agonists. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevent firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in ICUs, no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with impending respiratory failure. These findings support current national and international recommendations indicating that healthcare practitioners should refrain from using anticholinergics in children hospitalised for acute asthma.","Are inhaled anticholinergics added to β 2 ‐agonists beneficial in children hospitalised with acute asthma? Background:  Anticholinergics (e.g. ipratropium bromide, atropine sulfate) are inhaled drugs. They relax the airway muscles and decrease secretions. Anticholinergics are sometimes used in addition to beta 2 ‐agonists (such as salbutamol and terbutaline), which are potent drugs given to relax smooth muscles in the airways in children with acute asthma. We do not know whether the addition of inhaled anticholinergics to beta 2 ‐agonists is beneficial for children hospitalised with acute asthma. Review question:  We wished to examine the efficacy and safety of inhaled or nebulised (mist inhaled into the lungs) anticholinergics added to beta 2 ‐agonists compared with beta 2 ‐agonists alone in children one to 18 years of age hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. Study characteristics:  In reviewing evidence available until November 2013, we found seven eligible studies of children hospitalised with acute asthma; four of these studies (472 children one to 18 years of age) contributed data to the review. Four studies compared the combination of anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide) and beta 2 ‐agonists versus the same dose of beta 2 ‐agonists alone. Included studies enrolled both girls and boys, with a gender ratio ranging from 59% to 73% males. Results:  No additional benefit was noted by adding anticholinergics to β 2 ‐agonists in terms of duration of hospital stay in patients compared to those who received beta 2 ‐agonists alone. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. No trial reported information on serious adverse events. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other markers of response to therapy, that is, the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short‐acting beta 2 ‐agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. Conclusion:  No apparent benefit is derived from adding anticholinergics to beta 2 ‐agonists in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, that is, beyond initial treatment in the emergency department. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevents firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with very severe exacerbations who are admitted to the ICU. Our findings support the ongoing recommendations provided by national and international guidelines. Quality of the results:  This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with acute asthma. All trials contributing to the primary outcome are of high methodological quality, but they are few. As the addition of new trials may change the conclusion, the quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate. Additional and larger trials are needed.",CD010283
"Background Securing the endotracheal tube is a common procedure in the neonatal intensive care unit. Adequate fixation of the tube is essential to ensure effective ventilation of the infant whilst minimising potential complications secondary to the intervention. Methods used to secure the endotracheal tube often vary between units and sometimes even between healthcare providers in the same nursery. Objectives To compare the different methods of securing the endotracheal tube in the ventilated neonate and their effects on the risk of accidental extubation and other potential complications that can result from an unstable endotracheal tube. Search methods A literature search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 2013), CINAHL (from 1982 to June 2013) and CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  was conducted to identify relevant trials to be analysed. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of infants who were intubated for mechanical ventilation in a neonatal intensive care nursery where methods of stabilising the endotracheal tube were being compared. Data collection and analysis Data were collected from individual studies to determine the methods being compared, the methodology of the trial, and whether there were areas of bias that could significantly affect the results of the studies. In particular, studies were assessed for blinding of randomisation and allocation, blinding of the intervention, completeness of follow up, blinding of outcome assessments and selective reporting. Main results Five randomised controlled trials were identified and included for review. Accidental extubation was the most common outcome measured (five studies). None of the studies reported on the need for re‐intubation or the rate of tube malposition, however one study did report on endotracheal tube slippage. A variety of other adverse effects were reported including mortality, incidence of perioral skin trauma and tube re‐taping. All five studies were of poor methodological quality, small size, contained significant risks of bias and compared methods of securing the endotracheal tube that were too dissimilar for the data to be collated or included in a meta‐analysis. We have not reported these further. Authors' conclusions This review highlighted the need for further well designed and completed studies to be conducted for this common neonatal procedure. Evidence is lacking to determine the most effective and safe method to stabilise the endotracheal tube in the ventilated neonate.","Methods for securing endotracheal tubes in newborn infants Review question Over the years, there have been multiple different ways an endotracheal tube has been secured in the ventilated newborn. We reviewed the evidence for the most effective method to secure an endotracheal tube in infants requiring mechanical ventilation. We found five randomised controlled trials which compared different methods of securing an endotracheal tube and studied their effects on outcomes such as accidental extubation. Background As neonatal care and the survival rates of premature infants continues to improve, there will be an ongoing need for newborns to be intubated and ventilated. These are often the sickest babies in the nursery, so optimising practice in this area could impact outcomes. The aim of effectively securing an endotracheal tube is to provide continuous optimal ventilation whilst minimising the risk of developing complications from an unstable tube. Search date The evidence was current to June 2013. Study characteristics The five studies included in this review enrolled patients from a neonatal intensive care nursery who were intubated and ventilated. Trial durations ranged from the time required to enrol the small recruitment targets up to 10 months. Numbers of participants in the studies ranged from 30 to 203 ventilated infants. Key results Accidental extubation was the outcome measured in all five studies and was the outcome of interest in this review. Other secondary outcomes included skin trauma, tube slippage and rates of preventive re‐taping. All five studies compared methods of securing the endotracheal tube that were too dissimilar for the data to be collated or included in a meta‐analysis. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was low. Limitations in design and implementation were evident to different degrees in all five studies. None of the studies indicated whether allocation was concealed. Due to the nature of the intervention the studies were unable to be blinded, however none of the studies indicated whether data were collected in a blinded fashion therefore conferring risks of bias. One study had a large group of neonates that were excluded from the analysis and publication bias. Conclusive results from well designed and conducted trials could help to optimise current practice.",CD007805
"Background PRO 140 (a humanized form of the PA14 antibody, a monoclonal CCR5 antibody) inhibits CCR5‐tropic (R5) type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This may be an effective new treatment with the potential to address the limitations of currently available therapies for HIV‐infected patients. Objectives We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, clinical disease progression and immunologic (CD4 count/percentage) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA viral load) markers of PRO 140 for HIV‐infected patients in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized controlled trials (quasi‐RCTs). Search methods We searched databases including  The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (PubMed, January 1966 to April 2014), EMBASE (January 1978 to April 2014) and ISI Web of Knowledge (January 1966 to April 2014) , online trials registries and other sources. We also screened the reference lists of related literature and eligible studies, and presentations from major HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) conferences. Selection criteria We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing PRO 140 with placebo or other antiretroviral drugs, or different doses of PRO 140 for individuals infected with HIV. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers (L Li and JH Tian) independently screened all retrieved citations and selected eligible studies. Two authors (P Zhang and WQ Jia) independently extracted data. Any disagreements when selecting studies and extracting data were adjudicated by the review mentor (KH Yang). We used Review Manager (RevMan) software for statistical analysis based on an intention‐to‐treat analysis. We examined heterogeneity using the Chi 2  statistic. We regarded I 2  estimates greater than 50% as moderate or high levels of heterogeneity. According to the level of heterogeneity, we used either a fixed or random‐effects model.If significant heterogeneity existed and the reasons could not be found, we reported the results qualitatively. Main results We included three trials comparing PRO 140 with placebo in adult patients with HIV infection. Our review indicates that PRO 140 may offer significant dose‐dependent HIV‐1 RNA suppression with tolerable side effects. PRO 140 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 162 mg weekly, 324 mg biweekly, and 324 mg weekly showed statistically significant differences in the changes of HIV‐1 RNA levels. HIV‐1 RNA levels were reduced by intravenous (IV) infusion of PRO 140 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg on day 10, 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg on day 12, 162 mg weekly, 324 mg biweekly, or 324 mg weekly on day 22. PRO 140 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 162 mg weekly, 324 mg biweekly, and 324 mg weekly demonstrated greater antiviral response. PRO 140 324 mg weekly, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg showed more patients with ≦ 400 copies/mL HIV‐1 RNA. Only PRO 140 5 mg/kg showed greater change in CD4 +  cell count on day eight. Headache, lymphadenopathy, diarrhoea, fatigue, hypertension, nasal congestion and pruritus were reported to be the most frequent adverse events. Authors' conclusions Limited evidence from three small trials suggests that PRO 140 might demonstrate potent, short‐term, dose‐dependent, highly significant antiviral activity. However, as the evidence is insufficient, recommendations cannot yet be made. Larger, longer‐term, double‐blind RCTs are required to provide conclusive evidence.","PRO 140 for treatment of people with HIV infection PRO 140 (a humanized form of the PA14 antibody, a monoclonal CCR5 antibody) is a laboratory made antibody that blocks the CCR5 receptor on CD4 cells. By blocking CCR5, PRO 140 prevents the HIV virus from infecting healthy cells. PRO 140 may be an effective new treatment drug because it has the potential to address the limitations of currently available therapies for HIV‐infected patients. PRO 140 has emerged as an important new therapy and has entered testing. We reviewed the efficacy, safety, clinical disease progression and immunologic (CD4 count/percentage) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA viral load) markers of PRO 140 for HIV‐infected patients. We included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The evidence is current to April, 2014. These three RCTs were of unclear risk of bias, as the details of methodological items were not adequately reported. All patients in these three studies were adult HIV‐infected patients, PRO 140 was adminstrated subcutaneous or intravenous infusion with different doses. These three studies adressed the immunologic (CD4 count/percentage) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA viral load) markers. There may be potential conflicts of interest in all studies, as some of the authors are current or past employees of Progenics Pharmaceuticals, the producer of PRO 140. Our systematic review showed that PRO 140 may offer significant short‐term dose‐dependent HIV‐1 RNA suppression with tolerable side effects. PRO 140 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 162 mg weekly, 324 mg biweekly, and 324 mg weekly could reduce HIV‐1 RNA levels and demonstrate antiviral response. And PRO 140 5 mg/kg showed greater change in CD4 +  cell count on day eight. Headache, lymphadenopathy, diarrhoea, fatigue, hypertension, nasal congestion and pruritus were reported to be the most frequent adverse events. Even though available evidence from the three trials suggests that PRO 140 may be effective, the number of patients in these three studies was very small, and the results of these three studies may be influenced by potential biases. So the quality of the evidence from available RCTs was low. PRO 140 has been granted fast‐track approval status by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the efficacy of PRO 140 still needs to be proven in large, long‐term high quality RCTs. The three studies reviewed here only evaluated the short‐term (58 or 59 days) efficacy. The long‐term efficacy was not evaluated, and adverse events data were not reported adequately for each group. So any recommendations cannot yet be made for applying this evidence. Whether PRO 140 could be used in clinical practice as first‐line treatment for HIV‐infected patients or not depends on the results of high quality future RCTs.",CD008439
"Background Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between any other antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Objectives To review the effects in response to treatment of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (November 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing trifluoperazine with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported.    Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low‐potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56,  moderate quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17, low quality evidence ). There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low‐potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74,  moderate quality evidence ). However, at least one movement disorder was significantly more frequent in the trifluoperazine group (trifluoperazine 23%, low‐potency antipsychotics 13%, 2 RCTs, n = 123, RR 2.08 CI 0.78 to 5.55,  very low quality evidence ) as well as incoordination (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 5%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 7.00, CI 1.60 to 30.66) and rigor (trifluoperazine 45%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 4.50, CI 1.58 to 12.84). No data were available for other outcomes of interest death, sedation and quality of life. Authors' conclusions The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Trifluoperazine produced more movement disorders. The number of randomised studies as well as their quality is low, the quality of evidence for outcomes of interest ranged from moderate to very low quality, so more, newer studies would be needed for conclusions about the relative effects of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics.","Trifluoperazine versus low‐potency first‐generation drugs for schizophrenia Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high‐potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side‐effects. The classification into high‐potency and low‐potency medication means that low‐potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side‐effects that are common to most high‐potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low‐potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high‐potency drugs with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high‐potency antipsychotic) with low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low‐potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine. The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people. It compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality. Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things. They differ slightly in their side‐effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low‐potency antipsychotics was found. Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

"Background The high mortality rate among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) remains an unsolved problem in intensive care medicine, despite the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Increasing evidence from clinical studies in adults and children suggests that the new peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids may allow for better long‐term preservation of peritoneal morphology and function. Formation of glucose degradation products (GDPs) can be reduced and even avoided with the use of newer ""biocompatible"" solutions. However, it is still unclear if there are any differences in using conventional (lactate) solutions compared with low GDP (bicarbonate) solutions for acute PD. Objectives To look at the benefits and harms of bicarbonate versus lactate solutions in acute PD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database LILACS (from 1982), and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: 6 May 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bicarbonate to lactate solution for acute PD. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assess the methodological quality of studies. One author abstracted data onto a standard form, and a second author checked data extraction. We used the random‐effects model and expressed the results as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included one study (20 patients) in this review. In shock patients, bicarbonate did not differ from lactate with respect to mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.91); however there were significant differences in blood lactate (MD ‐1.60 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐1.16), serum bicarbonate (MD 5.00 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.26 to 6.74) and blood pH (MD 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.18). In non‐shock patients there was a significance difference in blood lactate (MD ‐0.60 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.35) but not in serum bicarbonate (MD 1.10 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 2.47) or blood pH (MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.02 to ‐0.06). Other outcomes could not be analysed because of the limited data available. Authors' conclusions There is no strong evidence that any clinical advantage for patients requiring acute PD for AKI when comparing conventional (lactate) with low GDP dialysis solutions (bicarbonate).","Two dialysis solutions for acute peritoneal dialysis Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be treated with either bicarbonate or lactate in acute peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of bicarbonate versus lactate solution. We identified only one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) (20 patients) after an extensive literature search, and we found no difference between bicarbonate and lactate for clinically important outcomes, such as mortality and adverse events. An initial reported benefit of bicarbonate over lactate was not confirmed by subsequent studies. In this systematic review of one RCT of patients with AKI, no significance difference was demonstrable between these two dialysis solutions.",CD007034
"Background People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often become transiently hypoxaemic (low oxygen levels in blood) on exercise, necessitating oxygen therapy to improve breathlessness and exercise capacity and to reduce disability. Ambulatory oxygen therapy refers to provision of oxygen therapy during exercise and activities of daily living. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is often used by patients on long‐term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during exercise or by non‐LTOT users with or without resting hypoxaemia when they show evidence of exercise de‐saturation and demonstrate improvement in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen. Objectives To determine the longer‐term efficacy of ambulatory oxygen therapy only in patients with COPD who do not meet the criteria for LTOT, with respect to improvement in exercise capacity, mortality, quality of life and other relevant measures of improvement. Search methods The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, was searched. Online clinical trial registers, including Controlled Clinical Trials (www.controlled‐trials.com), government registries (clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) registries (www.who.int/trialsearch), were screened for ongoing and recently completed studies. Bibliographies of included studies were searched for additional trials that may meet the inclusion criteria and were not retrieved by the above search strategy. Authors of identified trials were contacted to provide other published and unpublished studies. Searches were current as of November 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare ambulatory oxygen therapy provided through portable oxygen cylinders/battery‐powered devices or liquid oxygen canisters versus placebo air cylinders, usual medical care or co‐intervention in study participants with COPD who did not meet criteria for LTOT. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Four studies met the inclusion criteria (331 participants), with two studies producing a statistically and clinically significant benefit in favour of the intervention for dyspnoea post exercise.The quality of life domain for all four included studies produced a statistically significant benefit for the subcategories of dyspnoea and fatigue, in favour of the oxygen group (dyspnoea mean difference (MD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.45; P value 0.002; fatigue MD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.31; P value 0.009). No evidence of any effect was reported for survival, and limited benefits were observed for exercise capacity (as measured by step test and distance walk test), with one study showing a statistically significant improvement in the number of steps taken in the oxygen group for group N‐of‐1 studies only. No other statistically significant benefits were observed for exercise capacity among the other trials or individual N‐of‐1 studies. Authors' conclusions In patients with COPD with moderate hypoxia, current evidence on ambulatory oxygen therapy reveals improvements in dyspnoea post exercise and in the dyspnoea and fatigue domain of quality of life. However, evidence for the clinical utility and effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen in improving mortality and exercise capacity was not evident in this review. Methodologically rigorous RCTs with sufficient power to detect a difference are required to investigate the role of ambulatory oxygen in the management of COPD.","Portable oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Background   Some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have low oxygen levels in their blood when they are resting or when moving. Low oxygen levels are known as hypoxaemia. These patients can carry around an oxygen supply (oxygen in small cylinders, portable liquid oxygen systems or battery‐powered oxygen concentrators) so that they have oxygen to breathe to make simple tasks such as getting dressed, leaving the house, doing chores or even walking around their own home easier, and to help them to breathe. This portable oxygen device is referred to as 'ambulatory oxygen.' Review question   We conducted this review to find out the long‐term benefit of ambulatory oxygen therapy for people who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest. Study characteristics   We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air). We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years. Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada. The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light‐weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. Final follow‐up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study. Key results   We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired. However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change. Quality of the evidence   The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was moderate. The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported in all cases. Most studies were lacking the pre‐published study plan (protocol). Bottom line   From this review, it is not possible to know whether ambulatory oxygen therapy should be provided during exercise or for day‐to‐day activities for patients with COPD who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest. This Cochrane plain language summary is up‐to‐date as of November 2012.",CD000238
"Background Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that is characterised by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue and leakage of intracellular myocyte contents into circulating blood. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and is a potentially life‐threatening condition. Studies have indicated that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis by removing potentially damaging myoglobin and stabilising haemodynamic and metabolic status. Objectives We aimed to: i) assess the efficacy of CRRT in removing myoglobin; ii) investigate the influence of CRRT on mortality and kidney‐related outcomes; and iii) evaluate the safety of CRRT for the treatment of people with rhabdomyolysis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 January 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure (from 1 January 1979 to 16 April 2013) and the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (to 16 April 2013). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that investigated clinical outcomes of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main results Of the three included studies (101 participants), one evaluated continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis and two investigated continuous venovenous haemofiltration; all included conventional therapy as control. We found significant decreases in myoglobin in patients among whom CRRT therapy was initiated on days four, eight, and 10 (day 4: MD ‐11.00 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐20.65 to ‐1.35; Day 8: MD ‐23.00 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐30.92 to ‐15.08; day 10: MD ‐341.87 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐626.15 to ‐57.59) compared with those who underwent conventional therapy. Although CRRT was associated with improved serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; reduced duration of the oliguria phase; and was associated with reduced time in hospital, no significant differences were found in mortality rates compared with conventional therapy (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.37). The included studies did not report on long‐term outcomes or prevention of AKI. Overall, we found that study quality was suboptimal: blinding and randomisation allocation were not reported by any of the included studies, leading to the possibility of selection, performance and detection bias. Authors' conclusions Although CRRT may provide some benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis, the poor methodological quality of the included studies and lack of data relating to clinically important outcomes limited our findings about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis. There was insufficient evidence to discern any likely benefits of CRRT over conventional therapy for people with rhabdomyolysis and prevention of rhabdomyolysis‐induced AKI.","Is continuous renal replacement therapy beneficial for people with rhabdomyolysis? Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life‐threatening condition where damaged muscle tissue breaks down quickly, and products of damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream. Of these products, a protein called myoglobin is harmful to kidney health and can lead to acute kidney injury. There is some evidence to suggest that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis. We searched the literature published before 6 January 2014, and after assessment, included three small studies that involved 101 participants. Our analysis found that although CRRT showed limited advantages over conventional treatment to improve some aspects of kidney function and muscle tissue loss, we found no significant benefits in reducing risk of death. The small body of available evidence demonstrated poor methodological quality, and was insufficient to enable us to make any robust conclusions about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis. Larger and better designed studies would be needed to investigate if CRRT is beneficial for people with rhabdomyolysis.",CD008566
"Background Breastfeeding is known to be the biological norm. Despite this, many women wean their babies because of perceived insufficient breast milk production. Mothers are sometimes advised to increase their fluid intake in the hope that this could improve breast milk production. The effect of extra fluid on human breast milk production is not well established, however. Objectives To assess the effect of extra fluid for breastfeeding mothers on milk production/supply and infant growth. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 April 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to 27 April 2014), African Journals Online (27 April 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials on extra fluids for breastfeeding mothers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the potential studies for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Main results Five trial reports were retrieved using the search strategies. Four trials were excluded. We did not identify any randomised controlled trials for inclusion but we included one quasi‐randomised study (involving 210 women) that evaluated the effect of extra fluid for breastfeeding mothers on breastfeeding outcomes. The study was considered to be at a high risk of bias. Only one of this review's primary outcomes was reported (breast milk production (as defined by the trialist)) but data were not in a suitable format for analysis (no standard deviations or standard errors were reported). The trialist reported that advising women to drink extra fluids did not improve breast milk production. No data were reported for the review's other primary outcomes: satisfactory weight gain in the infant (as defined by the trialists) and duration of exclusive breastfeeding (months). Similarly, no data were reported for any of this review's secondary outcomes: duration of any breastfeeding; mother's satisfaction with breastfeeding; hydration in mother; dehydration in the infant; or episodes of gastrointestinal illness. Authors' conclusions This review only identified one small quasi‐randomised controlled trial of low quality and high risk of bias. The study provided limited data on only one of this review's primary outcomes, breast milk production, but the data were not reported in a format that permitted further analysis. The trialist reported that extra fluids did not improve breast milk production. However, this outcome was measured by using test feeds (also known as test weighing). In the 1950s, when the study was conducted, it was common for babies in developed countries to be weighed before and after a feed, known as test weighing or test feeding. However, this practice is not now routinely practiced for term infants due to concerns about lack of precision as a measure of breast milk production. The included study did not report on this review's other primary outcomes (satisfactory weight gain in the infant or duration of exclusive breastfeeding) nor any of the review's secondary outcomes. The effect of additional fluids for breastfeeding mothers remains unknown, due to a lack of well‐conducted trials. However, because the physiological basis for any such improvement remains unclear, the conduct of further clinical trials may not be a priority. There is not enough evidence to support an increased fluid intake beyond what breastfeeding mothers are likely to require to meet their physiological needs.","Extra fluids for breastfeeding mothers for increasing milk production The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for infants during the first six months of life. Despite this, many women wean their babies because of their perceived insufficient breast milk production. In many cases where mothers are concerned about their milk production they are encouraged to increase their fluid intake. The mother also needs water to meet her own needs. Water and all the constituents of body fluid are continually being lost in urine, stool and sweat and, therefore need to be replaced. This review aimed to assess whether increasing fluid intake of breastfeeding mothers has a beneficial effect on breast milk production and infant growth. However, the review only identified one small quasi‐randomised controlled trial (involving 210 women). The trial was of low quality and did not report on two of this review's important outcomes (satisfactory weight gain in the infant or duration of exclusive breastfeeding). The study did report on breast milk production (this review's other main outcome), but the data were not in a format that would permit further analysis in this review. The trial reported that advising women to consume extra fluids did not result in increased breast milk production, as measured by test feeds (also known as test weighing). In the 1950s, when the study was conducted, it was common for babies in developed countries to be weighed before and after a feed, known as test weighing or test feeding. However, this practice is not now routinely practiced for term infants due to concerns about lack of precision as a measure of breast milk production. The included study did not report any of this review's secondary outcomes: duration of any breastfeeding; mother's satisfaction with breastfeeding; hydration in mother; dehydration in the infant; or episodes of gastrointestinal illness. The effect of additional fluids for breastfeeding mothers remains unknown, due to a lack of well‐conducted trials. However, because the physiological basis for any such improvement remains unclear, the conduct of further clinical trials may not be a priority. There is not enough evidence to support an increased fluid intake beyond what breastfeeding mothers are likely to require to meet their physiological needs.",CD008758
"Background A cholesterol‐lowering diet and several other dietary interventions have been suggested as a management approach either independently or as an adjuvant to drug therapy in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). However, a consensus has yet to be reached on the most appropriate dietary treatment. Plant sterols are commonly used in FH although patients may know them by other names like phytosterols or stanols. Objectives To examine whether a cholesterol‐lowering diet is more effective in reducing ischaemic heart disease and lowering cholesterol than no dietary intervention in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Further, to compare the efficacy of supplementing a cholesterol‐lowering diet with either omega‐3 fatty acids, soya proteins, plant sterols or plant stanols. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated with each new issue of  The Cochrane Library ), quarterly searches of MEDLINE and the prospective handsearching of one journal ‐  Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease.  Most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 22 August 2013. We also searched PubMed to 05 February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, both published and unpublished, where a cholesterol‐lowering diet in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia has been compared to other forms of dietary treatment or to no dietary intervention were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility and risk of bias and one extracted the data, with independent verification of data extraction by a colleague. Main results In the 2014 update of the review, 15 trials have been included, with a total of 453 participants across seven comparison groups. The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the parameters used for risk assessment. Only short‐term outcomes could be assessed due to the short duration of follow up in the included trials. None of the primary outcomes, (incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death) were evaluated in any of the included trials. No significant differences were noted for the majority of secondary outcomes for any of the planned comparisons. However, a significant difference was found for the following comparisons and outcomes: for the comparison between plant sterols and cholesterol‐lowering diet (in favour of plant sterols), total cholesterol levels, mean difference 0.30 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48); decreased serum LDL cholesterol, mean difference ‐0.60 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.31). Fasting serum HDL cholesterol levels were elevated, mean difference ‐0.04 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.03) and serum triglyceride concentration was reduced, mean difference ‐0.03 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.15 to ‐0.09), although these changes were not statistically significant. Similarly, guar gum when given as an add on therapy to bezafibrate reduced total cholesterol and LDL levels as compared to bezafibrate alone. Authors' conclusions No conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of a cholesterol‐lowering diet, or any of the other dietary interventions suggested for familial hypercholesterolaemia, for the primary outcomes: evidence and incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death,due to the lack of data on these. Large, parallel, randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol‐lowering diet and the addition of omega‐3 fatty acids, plant sterols or stanols, soya protein, dietary fibers to a cholesterol‐lowering diet.","Dietary modifications for managing familial hypercholesterolaemia Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited disorder characterised by a raised blood cholesterol, and premature ischaemic heart disease. Changing diet is an important management option to reduce low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) levels. Recently, certain lipid‐lowering drugs have shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of children with familial hypercholesterolaemia. However, dietary management remains important either on its own or combined with drug therapy. Several strategies are used to modify diet. This review aimed to compare cholesterol‐lowering dietary interventions either in combination with each other or alone. These interventions included adding omega‐3 fatty acids or plant sterols or plant stanols or soya proteins to diet. Fifteen trials were included in this updated review. The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the domains used for risk assessment. All the trials were short term and the majority were cross‐over in design. For most of the comparisons there was no significant difference in the various intervention strategies when compared to cholesterol‐lowering diet. However, for total cholesterol levels, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, a significant benefit was obtained with plant sterols. However, before drawing any conclusions, methodological problems with pooling results from cross‐over trials should be considered. There is a need for long‐term trials with parallel group design to assess the potential benefits and harms of a cholesterol‐lowering diet.",CD001918
"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders, that occurs in about 2.2 per 1000 births worldwide. Increasingly, some people with SCD develop secondary iron overload due to occasional red blood cell transfusions or are on long‐term transfusion programmes for e.g. secondary stroke prevention. Iron chelation therapy can prevent long‐term complications. Deferoxamine and deferiprone have been found to be efficacious. However, questions exist about the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with SCD and secondary iron overload. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: date of most recent search:13 March 2014. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Biosis Previews, Web of Science, Derwent Drug File, XTOXLINE, EBMR and  The Cochrane Library , respectively; date of most recent searches: 02 August 2013. We searched four trial registries:  www.controlled‐trials.com ;  www.clinicaltrials.gov ;  www.who.int./ictrp/en/ ;  www.drks.de ; date of most recent searches: 03 June 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron chelating treatment schedule. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the corresponding study authors for additional information. Main results Two studies (with 203 and 212 people) comparing the efficacy and safety of deferasirox and deferoxamine after 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively, were included. The overall quality, according to GRADE, for the main outcomes was moderate to low. Only limited data were available on mortality and end‐organ damage, although one study did assess mortality, relative risk 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 30.41), the 24‐week follow up was too short to allow us to draw firm conclusions. One study reported a relative risk of 1.26 for the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 30.41). Serum ferritin reduction was significantly greater with deferoxamine, mean difference of change of 440.69 µg/l (95% confidence interval 11.73 to 869.64). Liver iron concentration (reported in one study) measured by superconduction quantum interference device showed no significant difference for the overall group of patients adjusted for transfusion category, mean difference ‐0.20 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% confidence interval ‐3.15 to 2.75). The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ between drugs. Nausea, diarrhoea and rash occurred significantly more often in people treated with deferasirox, while adverse events of any kind were more often reported for patients treated with deferoxamine (one study). The mean increase of creatinine was also significantly higher with deferasirox, mean difference 3.24 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 6.03). Long‐term adverse events could not be measured in the included studies (follow up 52 weeks and 24 weeks). Patient satisfaction and the likelihood of continuing treatment, were significantly better with deferasirox. Authors' conclusions Deferasirox appears to be of similar efficacy to deferoxamine depending on depending on the appropriate ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. However, only limited evidence is available assessing the efficacy regarding patient‐important outcomes. The short‐term safety of deferasirox seems to be acceptable, however, follow up in the available studies was too short to assess long‐term side effects. Long‐term safety and efficacy data are available from a non‐controlled extension phase not included in our review; however, no valid comparative conclusions can be drawn and future studies should assess comparatively long‐term outcomes both for safety and efficacy.","Deferasirox for managing transfusional iron overload in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of deferasirox on secondary iron load in people with sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder. An increasing number of people with this disorder show secondary iron overload (an accumulation of excess iron in the body) due to repeated red blood cell transfusions. Since the human body is not able to actively get rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (known as iron chelators) is needed. Several years ago, a new oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. However, it is not known whether deferasirox offers advantages compared to other iron chelators (deferoxamine or deferiprone) with regard to effectiveness and safety. Study characteristics Two randomised studies, with moderate overall quality of evidence, comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine were identified. The evidence is current to 02 August 2013. The studies with 203 and 212 participants lasted for 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively. Key results Only little data on patient‐important outcomes such as mortality (limited by a short study follow up) and end‐organ damage (incidence of diabetes mellitus) were available. Iron removal, as measured by the surrogate marker serum ferritin was significantly greater with deferoxamine. In one study, both drugs were reported to work equally well in reducing liver iron concentration. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; the main side effects when compared to deferoxamine were increased frequency of nausea, diarrhoea and rash as well as a mean increase of creatinine, while adverse events of any kind were observed more often in people treated with deferoxamine. Patient satisfaction and compliance with therapy was significantly greater with deferasirox. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of evidence rated according to the GRADE criteria was moderate due to issues with study design. For four outcomes, namely liver iron concentration, serum ferritin, creatinine increase and satisfaction with treatment, it was judged as 'moderate' quality; for one outcome (discontinuations) was judged as 'low' quality. Summary In summary, the evidence from the two included studies suggests that deferasirox is similarly effective as deferoxamine depending on the appropriate ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the short term, deferasirox appears to have an acceptable safety profile, but there are no comparative data based on randomised controlled trials available looking at long‐term safety. Further data on long‐term efficacy on patient‐relevant outcomes and long‐term adverse effects are needed to decide whether deferasirox should be used as alternative to the first‐line option of deferoxamine. Currently, its use seems to be mainly warranted as a treatment option for people with sickle cell disease who cannot tolerate or comply with deferoxamine.",CD007477
"Background Antidepressants are widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage), usually in doses below those at which they exert antidepressant effects. An earlier review that included all antidepressants for neuropathic pain is being replaced by new reviews of individual drugs examining individual neuropathic pain conditions. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is occasionally used to treat neuropathic pain. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy of imipramine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and to assess the associated adverse events. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE on 18 November 2013, as well as the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also used our own handsearched database for older studies, and two clinical trials databases. Selection criteria We included randomised, double‐blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing imipramine with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only articles with full journal publication and extended trial abstracts and summaries. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence was derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention‐to‐treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks duration, parallel design); second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants which was considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. Main results Five studies treated 168 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy or polyneuropathy. The mean age in individual studies was between 47 and 56 years. Four studies used a cross‐over, and one a parallel group design; 126 participants were randomised to receive imipramine 25 mg to 350 mg daily (most took 100 mg to 150 mg daily). Comparators were placebo (an active placebo in one study), paroxetine, mianserin, venlafaxine, and amitriptyline, and treatment was given for 2 to 12 weeks. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias. No study provided first or second tier evidence for any outcome. No data were available on the proportion of people with at least 50% or 30% reduction in pain or equivalent, and data were available from only one study for our other primary outcome of Patient Global Impression of Change, reported as patient evaluation of pain relief of complete or good. No pooling of data was possible, but third tier evidence in individual studies indicated some improvement in pain relief with imipramine compared with placebo, although this is was very low quality evidence, derived mainly from group mean data and completer analyses, in small, short duration studies where major bias is possible. Four studies reported some information about adverse events, but reporting was inconsistent and fragmented, and the quality of evidence was very low. Participants taking imipramine generally experienced more adverse events, notably dry mouth, and a higher rate of withdrawal due to adverse events, than did participants taking placebo. Authors' conclusions This review found little evidence to support the use of imipramine to treat neuropathic pain. There was very low quality evidence of benefit but this came from studies that were methodologically flawed and potentially subject to major bias. Effective medicines with much greater supportive evidence are available.","Imipramine for neuropathic pain in adults Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (as in a fall, a cut, or an arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated with different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are usually not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Imipramine is from the same class of medicines as amitriptyline, which is widely recommended for treating neuropathic pain; imipramine may also be useful in these painful conditions. In 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials in which imipramine was used to treat neuropathic pain. We found five studies involving 168 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy or polyneuropathy. Studies were randomised and double‐blind, but all had one or more sources of potential major bias that could lead to overestimation of efficacy. It was not possible to combine information from the different studies, but individually they indicated some benefit from imipramine (usually at a dose between 100 mg and 150 mg daily) compared with placebo, at the expense of increased adverse events. There was too little information, which was of inadequate quality, to be sure that imipramine works as a pain medicine in neuropathic pain due to diabetes or due to damage to multiple nerves. There was no information about other types of neuropathic pain. Other medicines have been shown to be effective.",CD010769
"Background Horticultural therapy is defined as the process of utilising fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants facilitated by a trained therapist or healthcare provider, to achieve specific treatment goals or to simply improve a person's well‐being. It can be used for therapy or rehabilitation programs for cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and recreational benefits, thus improving the person's body, mind and spirit. Between 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication, and may also develop undesirable adverse effects, horticultural therapy may be of value for these people. Objectives To evaluate the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with standard care or other additional psychosocial interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (Janurary 2013) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing horticultural therapy plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and for binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results We included one single blind study (total n = 24). The overall risk of bias in the study was considered to be unclear although the randomisation was adequate. It compared a package of horticultural therapy which consisted of one hour per day of horticultural activity plus standard care with standard care alone over two weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. Only two people were lost to follow‐up in the study, both in the horticultural therapy group (1 RCT n = 24,RR 5.00 95% CI 0.27 to 94.34,  very low quality evidence ). There was no clear evidence of a difference in Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI‐C) change scores between groups, however confidence intervals were wide (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐0.90 95% CI ‐10.35 to 8.55,  very low quality evidence ). At the end of treatment, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) change scores in horticultural therapy group were greater than that in the control group (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐23.70 CI ‐35.37 to ‐ 12.03, very low quality evidence). The only included study did not report on adverse effects of interventions. Authors' conclusions Based on the current very low quality data, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. This therapy remains unproven and more and larger randomised trials are needed to increase high quality evidence in this area.","Gardening activity as a therapy for schizophrenia Horticultural therapy is based on the therapeutic value of participating in garden activities such as growing fruit or vegetables and/or flowers. Gardening is thought to improve people's well‐being through being a recreational and sociable activity which may lead to improvements in people's thinking, new friendships and more positive emotions. The benefits of gardening can also apply to people with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Gardening reduces stress, which is important because stress can often lead to mental illness. Gardening is also hard work and a physical activity, and so motivates people with mental illness who often feel tired and apathetic. Weight gain is common for people with mental illness and gardening is good physical exercise. Since 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia experience symptoms in spite of taking antipsychotic drugs and also because these drugs have debilitating side effects, horticultural therapy may be of value to these people. This review focuses on the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. An electronic search for relevant randomised trials was run in January 2013. Only one trial was included, it randomised a total of 24 people with schizophrenia to received either their standard care plus horticultural therapy or standard care only. The trial only lasted 2 weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. There are few results and the quality of evidence was rated by the review authors to be  very low quality.  Some of the information from this one study favoured horticultural therapy but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. More large, better conducted and reported trials are required to determine the effectiveness and benefits of horticultural therapy.

"Background A sedentary lifestyle and stress are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since yoga involves exercise and is thought to help in stress reduction it may be an effective strategy in the primary prevention of CVD. Objectives To determine the effect of any type of yoga on the primary prevention of CVD. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11) in  The Cochrane Library ; MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to November Week 3 2013); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2013 Week 48); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) (1970 to 4 December 2013); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 4 of 4, 2013) in  The Cochrane Library . We also searched a number of Asian databases and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2012). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles, and approached experts in the field. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of yoga and the comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest were clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include any trials that involved multifactorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Main results We identified 11 trials (800 participants) and two ongoing studies. Style and duration of yoga differed between trials. Half of the participants recruited to the studies were at high risk of CVD. Most of studies were at risk of performance bias, with inadequate details reported in many of them to judge the risk of selection bias. No study reported cardiovascular mortality, all‐cause mortality or non‐fatal events, and most studies were small and short‐term. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies making it impossible to combine studies statistically for systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. Yoga was found to produce reductions in diastolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) ‐2.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.52 to ‐1.28), which was stable on sensitivity analysis, triglycerides (MD ‐0.27 mmol/l, 95% CI ‐0.44 to ‐0.11) and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD 0.08 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14). However, the contributing studies were small, short‐term and at unclear or high risk of bias. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups for low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD ‐0.09 mmol/l, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.30), although there was moderate statistical heterogeneity. Adverse events, occurrence of type 2 diabetes and costs were not reported in any of the included studies. Quality of life was measured in three trials but the results were inconclusive. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence comes from small, short‐term, low‐quality studies. There is some evidence that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and uncertain effects on LDL cholesterol. These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution.","Yoga to prevent cardiovascular disease Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global health burden. Nevertheless, it is thought that the risk of CVD can be lowered by changing a number of risk factors, such as by increasing physical activity and using relaxation to reduce stress, both of which are components of yoga. This review assessed the effectiveness of any type of yoga in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD. Study Characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of yoga on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013. Key Results We found 11 trials (800 participants), none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of yoga on decreasing death or non‐fatal endpoints.There were variations in the style and duration of yoga and the follow‐up of the interventions ranged from three to eight months.The results showed that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (a blood lipid), and uncertain effects on low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. None of the included trials reported adverse events, the occurrence of type 2 diabetes or costs. Longer‐term, high‐quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of yoga for CVD prevention. Quality of the Evidence These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution. This is because the included studies were of short duration, small and at risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).",CD010072
"Background Mucus retention in the lungs is a prominent feature of bronchiectasis. The stagnant mucus becomes chronically colonised with bacteria, which elicit a host neutrophilic response. This fails to eliminate the bacteria, and the large concentration of host‐derived protease may contribute to the airway damage. The sensation of retained mucus is itself a cause of suffering, and the failure to maintain airway sterility probably contributes to the frequent respiratory infections experienced by many patients. Hypertonic saline inhalation is known to accelerate tracheobronchial clearance in many conditions, probably by inducing a liquid flux into the airway surface, which alters mucus rheology in a way favourable to mucociliary clearance. Inhaled dry powder mannitol has a similar effect. Such agents are an attractive approach to the problem of mucostasis, and deserve further clinical evaluation. Objectives To determine whether inhaled hyperosmolar substances are effective in the treatment of bronchiectasis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, trials registries, and the reference lists of included studies and review articles. Searches are current up to April 2014. Selection criteria Any randomised controlled trial (RCT) using hyperosmolar inhalation in patients with bronchiectasis not caused by cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed studies for suitability. We used standard methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria of the review (1021 participants). Five studies on 833 participants compared inhaled mannitol with placebo but poor outcome reporting meant we could pool very little data and most outcomes were reported by only one study. One 12‐month trial on 461 participants provided results for exacerbations and demonstrated an advantage for mannitol in terms of time to first exacerbation (median time to exacerbation 165 versus 124 days for mannitol and placebo respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.96, P = 0.022) and number of days on antibiotics for bronchiectasis exacerbations was significantly better with mannitol (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95%CI 0.58 to 1.00, P = 0.0496). However, exacerbation rate per year was not significantly different between mannitol and placebo (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08). The quality of this evidence was rated as moderate. There was also an indication, from only three trials, again based on moderate quality evidence, that mannitol improves health‐related quality of life (mean difference (MD) ‐2.05; 95% CI ‐3.69 to ‐0.40). An analysis of adverse events data, also based on moderate quality evidence, revealed no difference between mannitol and placebo (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.51). Two additional small trials on 25 participants compared mannitol versus no treatment and the data from these studies were inconclusive. Four studies (combined N = 113) compared hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline. On most outcomes there were conflicting results and the opportunities for the statistical aggregation of data from studies was very limited. It is not possible to draw robust conclusions for this comparison and judgments should be reserved until further data are available. Authors' conclusions There is an indication from a single, large, unpublished study that inhaled mannitol increases time to first exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis. In patients with near normal lung function, spirometry does not change dramatically with mannitol and adverse events are not more frequent than placebo. Further investigation is required in a patient population with impaired lung function. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect of nebulised hypertonic saline due to significant differences in the methodology, patient groups, and findings amongst the limited data available. The data suggest that it is unlikely to have benefit over isotonic saline in patients with milder disease, and hence future studies should test its use in those with more severe disease","Inhaled hyperosmolar agents for bronchiectasis Review question We wanted to know if inhaled hyperosmolar agents ‐ treatments which help people cough up sputum ‐ may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis. We only included trials on people who had bronchiectasis and who did not have cystic fibrosis. Therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions for people with cystic fibrosis. Background Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in the lung structure, tuberculosis, and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties and make people very ill by causing recurring lung infections that are difficult to clear with antibiotics. Breathing in (inhaling) hypertonic saline (salt solutions with a greater salt content than blood) liquids may help clear this mucus, as may the drug mannitol (inhaled in dry powder form). This is because the concentrated salt or sugar (mannitol) draws water into the mucus in the lung and makes it thinner and easier to cough out. Study characteristics We found 11 randomised controlled trials on 1021 participants that compared inhaled hyperosmolar agents versus no mucolytic treatment. Five studies compared inhaled mannitol versus placebo (with a total of 883 participants) and two very small studies (with a total of just 25 participants) compared inhaled mannitol with no treatment. We also found four studies (with a total of 113 participants) that compared hypertonic saline with isotonic (normal) saline. Key results For the comparison between mannitol and placebo only one study (a 12‐month trial with 461 participants) provided information on the number of people who had an exacerbation (or flare up) over the course of a year. This study showed that people who were treated with mannitol had 8% fewer exacerbations on average compared with placebo. Overall, we felt the quality of this evidence was moderate and new trials would be likely to change either how effective we think the treatment is or how confident we are about it. Three trials assessed the effect of mannitol on health‐related quality of life, and again the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. An analysis of adverse events data, also based on moderate quality evidence, revealed no difference between mannitol and placebo The trials comparing hypertonic saline with isotonic saline had conflicting results for most of the outcomes of interest. Because we were unable to combine the data, it is not possible to draw robust conclusions for this comparison and judgments should be reserved until further data are available. Our analysis of adverse events between hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline showed no significant difference however this was based on a single study and the quality of the evidence was moderate. Quality of the evidence Details of how the patients in the trials were allocated to receive mannitol or not was clearly described in only one of the studies, and similarly only one of the hypertonic saline versus isotonic saline studies provided this information. The general lack of information on this point was considered carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. Taking this into account, the quality of evidence was generally regarded as moderate both for the mannitol and hypertonic saline studies.",CD002996

For the update of this review we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013. We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotic use in elective and emergency colorectal surgery, with surgical wound infection as an outcome. Data collection and analysis Data were abstracted and reviewed by one review author and checked by another only for the single, dichotomous outcome of surgical wound infection. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE methods. Main results This updated review includes 260 trials and 68 different antibiotics, including 24 cephalosporins and 43,451 participants. Many studies had multiple variables that separated the two study groups; these could not be compared to other studies that tested one antibiotic and had a single variable separating the two groups. We did not consider the risk of bias arising from attrition and lack of blinding of outcome assessors to affect the results for surgical wound infection. Meta‐analyses demonstrated a statistically significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection when prophylactic antibiotics were compared to placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.41, high quality evidence). This translates to a reduction in risk from 39% to 13% with prophylactic antibiotics. The slightly higher risk of wound infection with short‐term compared with long‐term duration antibiotic did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30). Similarly risk of would infection was slightly higher with single‐dose antibiotics when compared with multiple dose antibiotics, but the results are compatible with benefit and harm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.10). Additional aerobic coverage and additional anaerobic coverage both showed statistically significant improvements in surgical wound infection rates (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68 and RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71, respectively), as did combined oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to intravenous alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.74), or oral alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76). Comparison of an antibiotic with anaerobic specificity to one with aerobic specificity showed no significant advantage for either one (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.36). Two small studies compared giving antibiotics before or after surgery and no significant difference in this timing was found (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.15). Established gold‐standard regimens recommended in major guidelines were no less effective than any other antibiotic choice. Authors' conclusions This review has found high quality evidence that antibiotics covering aerobic and anaerobic bacteria delivered orally or intravenously (or both) prior to elective colorectal surgery reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Our review shows that antibiotics delivered within this framework can reduce the risk of postoperative surgical wound infection by as much as 75%. It is not known whether oral antibiotics would still have these effects when the colon is not empty. This aspect of antibiotic dosing has not been tested. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and the frequency of longer‐term adverse effects such as  Clostridium difficile  pseudomembranous colitis.","Antibiotics administered to patients prior to colorectal surgery When people undergo surgical operations of their abdomen they are at risk of infection which will often be cured by an antibiotic. However, it might be better to give this before the operation to prevent the infection (prophylaxis or prophylactic use), rather than wait until an infection occurs before giving it. This review looks at the evidence for giving an antibiotic before surgery takes place. The review found 260 studies which had recruited over 43 thousand people undergoing abdominal surgery. The studies had some limitations in relation to the number of people who remained in the studies and the possibility that the results were affected because some of the researchers in the studies knew which people had received antibiotics before surgery. However, when the results were analysed effect of prophylactic antibiotics was consistently beneficial meaning that these limitations were unlikely to have had a major impact on the nature of the overall results. Abdominal surgical wound infection in patients having operations on the large intestine occurs in about 40% of patients if antibiotics are not given. This risk can be greatly diminished by the administration of antibiotics prophylactically before surgery. The antibiotic(s) given usuallly needs to cover different types of bacteria some of which need oxygen (aerobic bacteria) and others which do not need oxygen (anaerobic bacteria).. They are usually given via a canula injected into a vein, though there is evidence that a combination of oral and intravenous antibiotics may provide more protection. This last finding raises a problem in that current clinical practice is to avoid mechanical cleansing of the colon because it is not thought to be necessary before surgery (and not popular with patients). Studies that found a benefit to oral antibiotics were done at a time when mechanical cleansing of the colon was routinely done. In the light of current practice regarding mechanical cleansing before surgery of the colon, the benefit of oral antibiotics is uncertain.",CD001181
"Background Various approaches to physical rehabilitation may be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate surround the effectiveness of relative approaches. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use a mixture of components from several different approaches. Objectives To determine whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach. For the previous versions of this review, the objective was to explore the effect of 'physiotherapy treatment approaches' based on historical classifications of orthopaedic, neurophysiological or motor learning principles, or on a mixture of these treatment principles. For this update of the review, the objective was to explore the effects of approaches that incorporate individual treatment components, categorised as functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskeletal intervention (passive), neurophysiological intervention, cardiopulmonary intervention, assistive device or modality. In addition, we sought to explore the impact of time after stroke, geographical location of the study, dose of the intervention, provider of the intervention and treatment components included within an intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2012), EMBASE (1980 to December 2012), AMED (1985 to December 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2012). We searched reference lists and contacted experts and researchers who have an interest in stroke rehabilitation. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function, balance, gait velocity and length of stay. We included trials comparing physical rehabilitation approaches versus no treatment, usual care or attention control and those comparing different physical rehabilitation approaches. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently categorised identified trials according to the selection criteria, documented their methodological quality and extracted the data. Main results We included a total of 96 studies (10,401 participants) in this review. More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China. Generally the studies were heterogeneous, and many were poorly reported. Physical rehabilitation was found to have a beneficial effect, as compared with no treatment, on functional recovery after stroke (27 studies, 3423 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.97, for Independence in ADL scales), and this effect was noted to persist beyond the length of the intervention period (nine studies, 540 participants; SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.04). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value < 0.0001, for independence in ADL), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week is effective. This evidence principally arises from studies carried out in China. Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.003, for independence in ADL). We found physical rehabilitation to be more effective than usual care or attention control in improving motor function (12 studies, 887 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), balance (five studies, 246 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56) and gait velocity (14 studies, 1126 participants; SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value 0.02 for motor function), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes delivered five to seven days a week provides significant benefit. Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.05, for independence in ADL). No one physical rehabilitation approach was more (or less) effective than any other approach in improving independence in ADL (eight studies, 491 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.71) or motor function (nine studies, 546 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.41). These findings are supported by subgroup analyses carried out for comparisons of intervention versus no treatment or usual care, which identified no significant effects of different treatment components or categories of interventions. Authors' conclusions Physical rehabilitation, comprising a selection of components from different approaches, is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Evidence related to dose of physical therapy is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions. No one approach to physical rehabilitation is any more (or less) effective in promoting recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Therefore, evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation should not be limited to compartmentalised, named approaches, but rather should comprise clearly defined, well‐described, evidenced‐based physical treatments, regardless of historical or philosophical origin.","Physical rehabilitation approaches for recovery of function, balance and walking after stroke Question We wanted to know whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach. Background Stroke can cause paralysis of some parts of the body and other difficulties with various physical functions. Physical rehabilitation is an important part of rehabilitation for people who have had a stroke. Over the years, various approaches to physical rehabilitation have been developed, according to different ideas about how people recover after a stroke. Often physiotherapists will follow one particular approach, to the exclusion of others, but this practice is generally based on personal preference rather than scientific rationale. Considerable debate continues among physiotherapists about the relative benefits of different approaches; therefore it is important to bring together the research evidence and highlight what best practice ought to be in selecting these different approaches. Study characteristics We identified 96 studies, up to December 2012, for inclusion in the review. These studies, involving 10,401 stroke survivors, investigated physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke compared with no treatment, usual care or attention control or in comparisons of different physical rehabilitation approaches. The average number of participants in each study was 105: most studies (93%) included fewer than 200 participants, one study had more than 1000 participants, six had between 250 and 100 participants and 10 had 20 or fewer participants. Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function (functional movement), balance, walking speed and length of stay. More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China. These studies showed many differences in relation to the type of stroke and how severe it was, as well as differences in treatment, which varied according to both treatment type and duration. Key results This review brings together evidence confirming that physical rehabilitation (often delivered by a physiotherapist, physical therapist or rehabilitation therapist) can improve function, balance and walking after stroke. It appears to be most beneficial when the therapist selects a mixture of different treatments for an individual patient from a wide range of available treatments. We were able to combine the results from 27 studies (3243 stroke survivors) that compared physical rehabilitation versus no treatment. Twenty‐five of these 27 studies were carried out in China. Results showed that physical rehabilitation improves functional recovery, and that this improvement may last long‐term. When we looked at studies that compared additional physical rehabilitation versus usual care or a control intervention, we found evidence to show that the additional physical treatment improved motor function (12 studies, 887 stroke survivors), standing balance (five studies, 246 stroke survivors) and walking speed (14 studies, 1126 stroke survivors). Very limited evidence suggests that, for comparisons of physical rehabilitation versus no treatment and versus usual care, treatment that appeared to be effective was given between 30 and 60 minutes per day, five to seven days per week, but further research is needed to confirm this. We also found evidence of greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke, but again further research is needed to confirm this. We found evidence showing that no one physical rehabilitation approach was more effective than any other approach. This finding means that physiotherapists should choose each individual patient's treatment according to the evidence available for that specific treatment, and should not limit their practice to a single 'named' approach. Quality of the evidence It was difficult for us to judge the quality of evidence because we found poor, incomplete or brief reporting of information. We determined that less than 50% of the studies were of good quality, and for most studies, the quality of the evidence was unclear from the information provided.",CD001920
"Background Granulosa cell tumour is a rare gynaecological tumour of the ovary with recurrences many years after initial diagnosis and treatment. Evidence‐based management of granulosa cell tumour of the ovary is limited, and treatment has not been standardised. Surgery, including fertility‐sparing procedures for young women, has traditionally been the standard treatment. Adjuvant treatments following surgery have been based on non‐randomised trials. A combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) has traditionally been used for treatment of advanced and/or recurrent disease that cannot be optimally managed surgically. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment modalities offered in current practice for the management of primary, residual and recurrent adult‐onset granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 2013. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and observational studies that examined women with adult‐onset granulosa cell tumours of the ovary (primary and recurrent). For non‐randomised studies, we included studies that used multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline characteristics. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to treatment comparisons, so data were not synthesised in meta‐analyses, and methods for assessing heterogeneity were not needed. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed by using the six core items used to assess RCTs and by evaluating four additional criteria specifically addressing risk of bias in non‐randomised studies. Main results Five retrospective cohort studies (535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) that used appropriate statistical methods for adjustment were included in the review. Two studies, which carried out multivariate analyses that attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), reported no apparent evidence of a difference in overall survival between surgical approaches, whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study. One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent surgery alone (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 0.6, P value 0.04). Three studies reportedthat there was no evidence of differences in disease recurrence based on execution and type of adjuvant chemotherapy or on type of surgery or surgical approach, other than that surgical staging may be important. One study described no apparent evidence of a difference in disease recurrence between fertility‐sparing surgery and conventional surgery. Recurrence‐free survival was not reported in one study. Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life (QoL). All studies were at very high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions One study showed a lower recurrence rate with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, although this study was at high risk of bias and the results should be interpreted with caution. After evaluating the five small retrospective studies, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery, including conservative surgery, as well as adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for management of GCTs of the ovary. The available evidence is very limited, and the review provides only low‐quality evidence. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may alter our findings. Ideally, multinational RCTs are needed to answer these questions. The disease is relatively rare and generally has a good prognosis. RCTs are challenging to conduct, but three ongoing trials have been identified, demonstrating that they are feasible, although two of these studies are single‐arm trials. The study that may be able to provide answers to the question of which chemotherapeutic regimen should be selected for management of sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing, randomised, phase 2 study, led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group to compare the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel versus standard BEP. These investigators are also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers. Additional trials are required to assess toxicity and QoL associated with different treatment regimens as well as the safety of conservative surgical options.","Are any effective treatment options available for the management of granulosa cell tumour of the ovary? Background Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are rare ovarian tumours (2% to 5% of all ovarian cancers). Most ovarian tumours arise from the outer surface layer of the ovary, but GCTs arise from granulosa cells (sex cord cells) within the ovaries that produce oestrogen (primary female sex hormones). These tumours grow relatively slowly and can recur 10 to 15 years after primary treatment. If women with these tumours want to have children, the surgeon usually removes only the diseased ovary. However, standard treatment has consisted of surgery to remove tubes, ovaries and uterus, as most women develop GCTs around the time of the menopause, when fertility is no longer a matter of concern. Review question Previous studies have assessed chemotherapy (different combination regimens) with or without radiotherapy following surgery. This review aimed to examine the effects of various treatment methods, including fertility‐sparing surgery, on the survival of women with GCT of the ovary. Main findings Five retrospective studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria. Two studies, which attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), suggested that no apparent evidence could be found of differences in overall survival between surgical approaches (including whether the surgery was keyhole or open) whether a patient underwent lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all women combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study. One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent only surgery. In three studies, no apparent evidence to suggest that disease recurrence was associated with type of adjuvant chemotherapy or type of surgery, although surgical staging may be important. In one study, disease recurrence was not noted to be different between patients who underwent fertility‐sparing surgery, where only the affected fallopian tube and ovary were removed, and those treated with conventional surgery, in which both tubes and ovaries were removed. Given the high overall survival rate, fertility‐sparing surgery may be an important treatment option for young patients wishing to have children in the future. Recurrence‐free survival was not reported in one study. Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life. All studies were at very high risk of bias (low quality). Quality of the evidence All five studies were retrospective (looked at past findings) and were at very high risk of bias (low quality); therefore future studies should look at current evidence in randomised studies on adult GCT of the ovary. Three randomised studies comparing chemotherapy are ongoing. The study that may be able to answer the question regarding best choice of chemotherapy in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised study comparing the efficacy of two drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus standard chemotherapy (BEP ‐ bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin). Overall, the evidence in this review is of low quality, which may seriously weaken confidence in the results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on evidence provided in the future. The effectiveness and safety of different ways of treating patients with adult‐onset granulosa cell tumour of the ovary have not yet been assessed by high‐quality studies. Such trials are required to assess toxicity and quality of life associated with different treatments and to assess the safety of the types of surgery used. Generally, current evidence is not robust enough to allow recommendations for changes in clinical practice.",CD006912
"Background Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As tai chi involves exercise and can help in stress reduction, it may be effective in the primary prevention of CVD. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to November week 3, 2013); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 6 December 2013); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) (1970 to 6 December 2013); PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to December week 1, 2013); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 4, 2013). We also searched the Allied and complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and OpenGrey (inception to October 2012) and several Asian databases. We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of tai chi lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD. The comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and CVD risk factors. We excluded trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions or focusing on weight loss to avoid confounding. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Main results We identified 13 small trials (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies). Duration and style of tai chi differed between trials. Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney yin deficiency syndrome. No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all‐cause mortality or non‐fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow‐up of one year or less). There was also considerable heterogeneity between studies, which meant that it was not possible to combine studies statistically for cardiovascular risk (I 2  statistic for systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 96%, for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 96%, for total cholesterol 96%, low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) 95%, high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (HDL‐C) 98%, triglycerides 75%). Nine trials measured blood pressure, six individual trials found reductions in SBP (reductions ranged from ‐22.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐26.3 to ‐17.7) to ‐11.5 mmHg (95% CI ‐21.5 to ‐1.46)), two trials found no clear evidence of a difference (however, CIs were wide and an increase or decrease in SBP cannot be ruled out), and one trial found an increase in SBP with tai chi (increase 5.2 mmHg, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.67). A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from ‐12.2 mmHg (95% CI ‐15.8 to ‐8.7) to ‐4.43 mmHg (95% CI ‐7.14 to ‐1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs. Three trials reported lipid levels and two found reductions in total cholesterol, LDL‐C and triglycerides (total cholesterol reductions ranged from ‐1.30 mmol/L (95% CI ‐1.57 to ‐1.03) to ‐0.50 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.26): LDL‐C reductions ranged from ‐0.76 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.59) to ‐0.59 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.38): triglyceride reductions ranged from ‐0.46 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.62 to ‐0.30) to ‐0.37 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.67 to‐0.07)) and increased HDL‐C with the intervention (HDL‐C increases ranged from 0.61 mmol/L (95% CI 0.51 to 0.71) to 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.30)), while the third study found no clear evidence of a difference between groups on lipid levels. Quality of life was measured in one trial: tai chi improved quality of life at three months. None of the included trials reported on adverse events, costs or occurrence of type 2 diabetes. Authors' conclusions There are currently no long‐term trials examining tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD. Due to the limited evidence available currently no conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of tai chi on CVD risk factors. There was some suggestion of beneficial effects of tai chi on CVD risk factors but this was not consistent across all studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias. Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer‐term, high‐quality trials are needed.","Tai Chi to prevent cardiovascular disease Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels that are a worldwide health burden. However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi. This review assessed the effectiveness of tai chi interventions for healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD at reducing cardiovascular death, all‐cause death, non‐fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of tai chi on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013. Key results We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non‐fatal endpoints. There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow‐up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months. Due to the small number of short‐term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies. None of the included studies reported on adverse events. Longer‐term, high‐quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention. Quality of the evidence The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).",CD010366
"Background Osteoporosis is a bone mineralisation disorder occurring in about one third of adults with cystic fibrosis. Bisphosphonates can increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of new fractures in post‐menopausal women and people receiving long‐term oral corticosteroids. Objectives To assess the effects of bisphosphonates on the frequency of fractures, bone mineral density, quality of life, adverse events, trial withdrawals, and survival in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register of references (identified from electronic database searches and handsearches of journals and abstract books) on 13 January 2014. Additional searches of PubMed were performed on 13 January 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least six months duration studying bisphosphonates in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data. Trial investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Main results Nine trials were identified and seven (with a total of 237 adult participants) were included. Data were combined (when available) from six included studies in participants without a lung transplant. Data showed that there was no significant reduction in fractures between treatment and control groups at 12 months, odds ratio 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 3.80). No fractures were reported in studies with follow‐up at 24 months. However, in patients taking bisphosphonates after six months the percentage change in bone mineral density increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 4.61 (95% confidence interval 3.90 to 5.32) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 3.35 (95% confidence interval 1.63 to 5.07); but did not significantly change at the distal forearm, mean difference ‐0.49 (95% confidence interval ‐2.42 to 1.45). In patients taking bisphosphonates, at 12 months the percentage change in bone mineral density increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 6.10 (95% confidence interval 5.10 to 7.10) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 4.35 (95% confidence interval 2.99 to 5.70). At 24 months, in patients treated with bisphosphonates the percentage change in bone mineral density also increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 5.49 (95% confidence interval 4.38 to 6.60) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 6.05 (95% confidence interval 3.74 to 8.36). There was clinical heterogeneity between studies and not all studies reported all outcomes. Bone pain was the most common adverse event with intravenous agents. Flu‐like symptoms were also increased in those taking bisphosphonates. In participants with a lung transplant (one study), intravenous pamidronate did not change the number of new fractures. At axial sites, bone mineral density increased with treatment compared to controls: percentage change in bone mineral density at lumbar spine, mean difference 6.20 (95% confidence interval 4.28 to 8.12); and femur mean difference 7.90 (95% confidence interval 5.78 to 10.02). Authors' conclusions Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density in people with cystic fibrosis. Severe bone pain and flu‐like symptoms may occur with intravenous agents. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the more potent zoledronate and if corticosteroids ameliorate or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials are also required to further assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. Trials in larger populations are needed to determine effects on fracture rate and survival.","Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that affects many organs (e.g. lung and pancreas). It commonly leads to reduced bone mineral density, known as osteoporosis, which increases the likelihood of fractures. The short‐term and long‐term effects of fractures (e.g .  rib and vertebral) may make lung disease worse. Bisphosphonates are drugs that increase bone mineral density by slowing down bone resorption. They are used to treat osteoporosis caused by menopause or the use of corticosteroid drugs. The evidence available was limited to six trials with participants who had not undergone lung transplants (total of 203 adults) and one trial with 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation. Bisphosphonates consistently increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip regions. The rates of fractures (vertebral and non‐vertebral) or deaths were not reduced by bisphosphonate therapy. However, this may be related to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials. Severe bone pain and flu‐like symptoms were commonly linked to intravenous bisphosphonates, especially in people not using corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effect of pre‐treatment with corticosteroids. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the stronger drug zoledronate and if corticosteroids lessen or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials are also required to further assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates.

"Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) may be caused by the formation of extracellular senile plaques comprised of beta‐amyloid (Aß). In vitro and mouse model studies have demonstrated that metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) promote the solubilisation and clearance of Aß. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACs) for the treatment of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's dementia. Search methods We searched  ALOIS , the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 29 July 2010 using the terms: Clioquinol OR PBT1 OR PBT2 OR ""metal protein"" OR MPACS OR MPAC. Selection criteria Randomised double‐blind trials in which treatment with an MPAC was administered to participants with Alzheimer's dementia in a parallel group comparison with placebo were included. Data collection and analysis Three review authors (RM, LJ, ELS) independently assessed the quality of trials according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . The primary outcome measure of interest was cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests). The secondary outcome measures of interest were in the following areas: quality of life, functional performance, effect on carer, biomarkers, safety and adverse effects, and death. Main results Two MPAC trials were identified. One trial compared clioquinol (PBT1) with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognition (ADAS‐Cog)) between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change from baseline ADAS‐Cog score in the clioquinol arm compared with the placebo arm at weeks 24 and 36 was a difference of 7.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 13.24) and 6.36 (95% CI ‐0.50 to 13.23), respectively.There was no significant impact on non‐cognitive symptoms or clinical global impression. One participant in the active treatment group developed neurological symptoms (impaired visual acuity and colour vision) which resolved on cessation of treatment and were possibly attributable to the drug. In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. There was no significant difference in the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite or memory between placebo and PBT2 in the least squares mean change from baseline at week 12. However, two executive function component tests of the NTB showed significant improvement over placebo in the PBT2 250 mg group from baseline to week 12: category fluency test (2.8 words, 95% CI 0.1 to 5.4; P = 0.041) and trail making part B (‐48.0 s, 95% CI ‐83.0 to ‐13.0; P = 0.009). In the executive factor  Z  score, the difference in least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 for PBT2 250 mg compared with placebo was 0·27 (0·01 to 0·53; p=0·042).There was no significant effect on cognition on Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) or ADAS‐Cog scales. PBT2 had a favourable safety profile. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (PBT1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with AD, or whether the drug is safe. We have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre‐morbid IQ) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. The planned phase III trial of PBT1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. Larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy.","There is no evidence that MPACs (PBT1 or PBT2) are of benefit in Alzheimer's dementia The protein amyloid‐β (Aß) is strongly implicated in the development of Alzheimer's dementia, where it aggregates in clumps causing damage and death of brain cells. This clumping is encouraged by copper and zinc (metal ions) in the brain. Metal protein attenuating compounds (MPACS) bind strongly to copper and zinc (this is known as chelation), both preventing the clumping together of Aß and promoting processes which may cause it to dissolve and so be cleared from brain cells. Therefore MPACS may be a potential therapy for Alzheimer's dementia. Two different types of MPAC have been used in clinical trials and the drugs are known as PBT1 and PBT2. The trial of PBT1 compared with placebo (in 36 patients) showed no statistically significant difference in cognition or memory between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. We therefore conclude that there is no current evidence that treatment with clioquinol (PBT1) has any significant effect on cognition and in particular memory (as measured by the ADAS‐Cog scale) in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. This drug has now been withdrawn from development. The trial of PBT2 showed it was safe after 12 weeks of treatment but demonstrated no overall significant effect on cognition or memory.",CD005380
"Background Automated systems use closed‐loop control to enable ventilators to perform basic and advanced functions while supporting respiration. Selected automated systems can now not only measure selected respiratory variables and adapt ventilator output to individual patient needs by operationalizing predetermined algorithms but also automate the conduct of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). Objectives To summarize the evidence comparing automated weaning and SBT systems to non‐automated mechanical ventilation strategies on time to mechanical ventilation discontinuation in adult postoperative patients. In secondary objectives we ascertained differences between automated weaning and SBT systems and non‐automated mechanical ventilation discontinuation strategies on clinical outcomes (time to successful extubation, time to first SBT and first successful SBT, mortality, total duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay, use of non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) following extubation, and adverse events). Search methods We searched CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to May 2013); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to May 2013); CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to May 2013), Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and Ovid Health Star (1999 to May 2013), conference proceedings, trial registration websites, and contacted authors and content experts to identify potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials comparing automated weaning and SBT systems to non‐automated mechanical ventilation discontinuation strategies in intubated adults in the postoperative setting. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were planned to assess the impact of the type of (i) clinician primarily involved in implementing the automated weaning and SBT systems, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU), and (iii) non‐automated discontinuation (control) strategy utilized on selected outcomes. Main results We identified one randomized controlled trial of high quality, involving 300 patients , comparing SmartCare™ to a written protocol. In this trial, SmartCare™ had no effect on discontinuation time. While SmartCare™ significantly reduced the time to the first SBT (mean difference (MD) ‐0.34 days, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.08; P = 0.01) it did not reduce the time to the first successful SBT (MD ‐0.25 days, 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.05; P = 0.10) and other clinically important outcomes. SmartCare™ did not demonstrate beneficial effects on most clinically important outcomes including time to successful extubation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and the requirement for tracheostomy. Moreover, SmartCare™ did not favourably impact reintubation, mortality, self‐extubation, and the proportion of patients undergoing protracted mechanical ventilation, with a small numbers of events in this single trial. Authors' conclusions There is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute use of automated weaning and SBT systems in discontinuing invasive mechanical ventilation in adult postoperative patients. In a single large trial of high methodologic quality, while the use of SmartCare™ to adjust ventilator settings and conduct SBTs shortened the time to undergoing the first SBT, it did not reduce the time to the first successful SBT or the rate of tracheostomy compared to a written protocol implemented by physicians. SmartCare™ did not demonstrate beneficial effects on clinically important outcomes including time to mechanical ventilation discontinuation, time to successful discontinuation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay. Additional well‐designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the role for SmartCare™ on important outcomes in patients who predominantly require short term ventilation and in specific postoperative patient populations.","Use of SmartCare™ to aid discontinuing mechanical ventilation of adults in the postoperative period We searched the medical literature databases to May 2013. In a single large trial of high methodologic quality that involved 300 patients, use of a system (SmartCare™) that automatically adjusted ventilator settings and conducted tests of patients' ability to breathe spontaneously there was no clear benefit of SmartCare™. While it reduced the time to undergo the first test of spontaneous breathing, it did not reduce the time to the first successful spontaneous breathing test compared to a written weaning protocol applied by physicians. There was no clear benefit of SmartCare™ on other clinically important outcomes including the time to successful discontinuation of artificial ventilation , the total duration of mechanical ventilation, the time spent in the intensive care unit and hospital, and the requirement for tracheostomy (an airway inserted into the trachea). Further studies are needed to clarify the role of SmartCare™ in the postoperative setting, in general, and in specific patient populations.",CD008639
"Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in  The Cochrane Library  2008, Issue 3. Upper abdominal surgical procedures are associated with a high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The risk and severity of postoperative pulmonary complications can be reduced by the judicious use of therapeutic manoeuvres that increase lung volume. Our objective was to assess the effect of incentive spirometry compared to no therapy or physiotherapy, including coughing and deep breathing, on all‐cause postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality in adult patients admitted to hospital for upper abdominal surgery. Objectives Our primary objective was to assess the effect of incentive spirometry (IS), compared to no such therapy or other therapy, on postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality in adults undergoing upper abdominal surgery. Our secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of IS, compared to no therapy or other therapy, on other postoperative complications, adverse events, and spirometric parameters. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (from inception to August 2013). There were no language restrictions. The date of the most recent search was 12 August 2013. The original search was performed in June 2006. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IS in adult patients admitted for any type of upper abdominal surgery, including patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants in this updated review. The methodological quality of the included studies was difficult to assess as it was poorly reported, so the predominant classification of bias was 'unclear'; the studies did not report on compliance with the prescribed therapy. We were able to include data from only 1160 patients in the meta‐analysis. Four trials (152 patients) compared the effects of IS with no respiratory treatment. We found no statistically significant difference between the participants receiving IS and those who had no respiratory treatment for clinical complications (relative risk (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.18). Two trials (194 patients) IS compared incentive spirometry with deep breathing exercises (DBE). We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS and those receiving DBE in the meta‐analysis for respiratory failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.04 to 10.50). Two trials (946 patients) compared IS with other chest physiotherapy. We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS compared to those receiving physiotherapy in the risk of developing a pulmonary condition or the type of complication. There was no evidence that IS is effective in the prevention of pulmonary complications. Authors' conclusions There is low quality evidence regarding the lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well‐designed trials in this field. There is a case for large RCTs with high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the use of incentive spirometry regarding mortality.","Incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after upper abdominal surgery Background Previous studies have suggested that between 17% and 88% of people having surgery on the upper abdomen will suffer complications that affect their lungs after the operation (postoperative pulmonary complications). The lung volume tends to fall after such surgeries. These complications can be made less likely and less severe with the careful use of treatments designed to encourage breathing in (inspiration) and thus increasing the volume of the lungs, as these volumes tend to fall after such surgeries. Incentive spirometers are mechanical devices developed to help people take long, deep, and slow breaths to increase lung inflation. Objective We reviewed the evidence about the effect of incentive spirometry (IS), compared to no intervention or other therapy, to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications (for example, pneumonia, fever, death) in people following upper abdominal surgery. Study characteristics We included adults (aged 18 years and above) admitted for any type of upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to August 2013. We found 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants. The maximum period of time that a patient was followed by the doctor was seven days postoperatively. The quality of the included studies was uncertain because of poor reporting in the published articles. Key results The following results were examined in this review: clinical complications, respiratory failure (that is, inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system), and pulmonary complications. The results from participants receiving IS were the same as for those receiving either no treatment, deep breathing exercises (DBE) or physiotherapy in the meta‐analyses for clinical complications, respiratory failure, and pulmonary complications. Quality of evidence Because of poorly conducted studies (results not similar across studies; some issues with study design and; not enough data collected and organized) we ranked the overall quality of the evidence reported in this review as low. Conclusion and future research There is low quality evidence showing a lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well‐designed trials in this field.",CD006058
"Background Various beneficial effects derived from neuraxial blocks have been reported. However, it is unclear whether these effects have an influence on perioperative mortality and major pulmonary/cardiovascular complications. Objectives Our primary objective was to summarize Cochrane systematic reviews that assess the effects of neuraxial blockade on perioperative rates of death, chest infection and myocardial infarction by integrating the evidence from all such reviews that have compared neuraxial blockade with or without general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for different types of surgery in various populations. Our secondary objective was to summarize the evidence on adverse effects (an adverse event for which a causal relation between the intervention and the event is at least a reasonable possibility) of neuraxial blockade. Within the reviews, studies were selected using the same criteria. Methods A search was performed in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on July 13, 2012. We have (1) included all Cochrane systematic reviews that examined participants of any age undergoing any type of surgical (open or endoscopic) procedure, (2) compared neuraxial blockade versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia or neuraxial blockade plus general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia and (3) included death, chest infection, myocardial infarction and/or serious adverse events as outcomes. Neuraxial blockade could consist of epidural, caudal, spinal or combined spinal‐epidural techniques administered as a bolus or by continuous infusion. Studies included in these reviews were selected on the basis of the same criteria. Reviews and studies were selected independently by two review authors, who independently performed data extraction when data differed from one of the selected reviews. Data were analysed by using Review Manager Version 5.1 and Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.044. Main results Nine Cochrane reviews were selected for this overview. Their scores on the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire varied from four to six of a maximal possible score of seven. Compared with general anaesthesia, neuraxial blockade reduced the zero to 30‐day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 0.94; I 2  = 0%) based on 20 studies that included 3006 participants. Neuraxial blockade also decreased the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79; I 2  = 0%) based on five studies that included 400 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between the two techniques (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.37; I 2  = 0%) based on six studies with 849 participants. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia did not affect the zero to 30‐day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.51; I 2  = 0%) based on 18 studies with 3228 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between combined neuraxial blockade‐general anaesthesia and general anaesthesia alone (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; I 2  = 0%) based on eight studies that included 1580 participants. The addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia reduced the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98; I 2  = 9%) after adjustment for publication bias and based on nine studies that included 2433 participants. The quality of the evidence was judged as moderate for all six comparisons. No serious adverse events (seizure or cardiac arrest related to local anaesthetic toxicity, prolonged central or peripheral neurological injury lasting longer than one month or infection secondary to neuraxial blockade) were reported. The quality of the reporting score of complications related to neuraxial blocks was nine (four to 12 (median range)) of a possible maximum score of 14. Authors' conclusions Compared with general anaesthesia, a central neuraxial block may reduce the zero to 30‐day mortality for patients undergoing surgery with intermediate to high cardiac risk (level of evidence, moderate). Further research is required.","Effects of spinals and epidurals on perioperative death, myocardial infarction and pneumonia: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews Epidurals and spinals are anaesthetic techniques that block the transmission of painful stimuli from a surgical site to the brain at the level of the spinal cord. They allow the surgeon to perform surgery on the lower part of the abdomen (below the umbilicus) or on the lower limbs with no painful sensation while the person remains conscious. In this Cochrane overview, we summarized relevant randomized controlled trials from nine Cochrane systematic reviews, in which epidurals or spinals were compared as a method of replacing general anaesthesia or were added to general anaesthesia to reduce the quantity of narcotics or muscle relaxants required during general anaesthesia. The types of surgery included were caesarean section, abdominal surgery, repair of hip fracture, replacement of hip and knee joints and surgery to improve circulation in the legs. When epidurals or spinals were used to replace general anaesthesia, the risk of dying during the surgery or within the following 30 days was reduced by approximately 29% (from 20 studies with 3006 participants). Also, the risk of developing pneumonia (chest infection) was reduced by 55% (from five studies with 400 participants). However, the risk of developing a myocardial infarction (heart attack) was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from six studies with 849 participants). When epidurals (and less frequently spinals) were used to reduce the quantity of other drugs required while general anaesthesia was used, the risk of dying during the surgery or within 30 days was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from 18 studies with 3228 participants). Also, a difference was not detected for the risk of developing myocardial infarction (from eight studies with 1580 participants). The risk of developing pneumonia was reduced by approximately 30% when a correction was made for possible missing studies (from nine studies with 2433 participants). No serious side effects (seizures, cardiac arrest, nerve damage lasting longer than one month or infection) were reported from the use of epidurals or spinals in these studies. The quality of the evidence for all six comparisons was rated as moderate because of some imperfections in how the studies were carried out. Therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may even change the results. .",CD010108
"Background The prevalence of obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m 2 ) is increasing in both developed and developing countries, leading to a rise in the numbers of obese patients requiring general anaesthesia. Obese patients are at increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and tracheal intubation can be more difficult. Flexible intubation scopes (FISs) are recommended as an alternative method of intubation in these patients. Intubation with an FIS is considered an advanced method, requiring training and experience; therefore it may be underused in clinical practice. Patient outcomes following intubation with these scopes compared with other devices have not been systematically reviewed. Objectives We wished to compare the safety and effectiveness of a flexible intubation scope (FIS) used for tracheal intubation in obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ) with other methods of intubation, including conventional direct laryngoscopy, non‐standard laryngoscopy and the use of intubating supraglottic airway devices. We aimed to compare the frequency of complications, as well as process indicators, such as time taken for intubation and the proportion of first attempts that were successful, between groups using the different methods of intubation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and two trial registers on 18 January 2013, and performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants aged 16 years and older with a BMI > 30 kg/m 2  that had compared the use of an FIS for tracheal intubation  with  any one of three comparison groups: direct laryngoscopy; non‐standard laryngoscopy (including indirect laryngoscopy using a videolaryngoscope (VLS) or a rigid or semi‐rigid stylet); or intubation of supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological approaches expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, including independent review of titles, data extraction and risk of bias assessment by two investigators. Main results Three eligible studies were identified, all comparing the use of an FIS with a VLS. All studies were small, with only 131 participants in total across all trials. It was impossible for the intubators to be unaware of the device used, so all studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes related to intubation. Because of substantial differences in design between the studies, we did not combine their results in meta‐analyses. The results for all outcomes were inconclusive, with no differences noted between FIS and VLS. Two studies with experienced intubators reported first attempt success rates greater than 70% in both groups and less than 5% of participants requiring a change of intubation device. No evidence was found of any difference in difficulty or time taken between FIS and VLS intubation. No serious complications or airway trauma was reported, so we were unable to address these outcomes. Bleeding was uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of participants, and we found no evidence that it was more likely in the FIS group. One small study with a novice intubator reported no successful intubations using an FIS and compared with the use of an intubating SAD and stylet, as well as with a VLS. With only five participants in each group, no conclusions can be drawn from these additional comparisons. Authors' conclusions The evidence base is sparse, and the existing literature does not address the clinical questions of patient safety posed by this review. We are therefore unable to draw any conclusions on safety or effectiveness. More primary research is needed to investigate optimal intubation techniques in obese patients, and new studies should be powered to detect differences in complications and in success rates rather than process measures such as speed, which are of limited clinical importance.","Intubation methods for obese patients requiring general anaesthesia Patients requiring general anaesthesia need assistance with breathing during the operation. To provide this, the anaesthetist may insert a tube through the mouth or nose and down the trachea (windpipe) into the lungs. This is known as tracheal intubation, and usually the intubator uses a metal instrument called a laryngoscope to position the patient so s/he can see the vocal cords directly (direct laryngoscopy). This can be a difficult procedure in obese men and women for various reasons, including fatty tissue in the neck and throat. Guidelines suggest the use of flexible intubation scopes (FISs) for tracheal intubation in obese people. These scopes allow the intubator to see the airway via a camera, but no reviews have examined the use of an FIS in this situation. Intubation with an FIS is considered an advanced method, requiring training and experience; therefore it may be underused in clinical practice. We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of an FIS used for tracheal intubation in obese patients with direct laryngoscopy and other intubation methods that give the intubator an indirect view of the larynx. These other methods include videolaryngoscopes (VLSs)—metal laryngoscopes that contain a camera. We found three small studies, with a total of 131 patients, that compared an FIS with a VLS. The results for all patient safety outcomes were inconclusive, and no differences were noted between intubation with a flexible scope and intubation with a videolaryngoscope. We are unable to make any recommendations for practice based on this review. More research is needed to identify the technique for intubating obese people that would offer the best success rate with the fewest complications.",CD010320
"Background Between 10% to 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones. Treatment of the bile duct stones can be conducted as open cholecystectomy plus open common bile duct exploration or laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LC + LCBDE) versus pre‐ or post‐cholecystectomy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in two stages, usually combined with either sphincterotomy (commonest) or sphincteroplasty (papillary dilatation) for common bile duct clearance. The benefits and harms of the different approaches are not known. Objectives We aimed to systematically review the benefits and harms of different approaches to the management of common bile duct stones. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 2013) in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (1974 to August 2013), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to August 2013). Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials which compared the results from open surgery versus endoscopic clearance and laparoscopic surgery versus endoscopic clearance for common bile duct stones. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models meta‐analyses, performed with Review Manager 5. Main results Sixteen randomised clinical trials with a total of 1758 randomised participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Eight trials with 737 participants compared open surgical clearance with ERCP; five trials with 621 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with pre‐operative ERCP; and two trials with 166 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with postoperative ERCP. One trial with 234 participants compared LCBDE with intra‐operative ERCP. There were no trials of open or LCBDE versus ERCP in people without an intact gallbladder. All trials had a high risk of bias. There was no significant difference in the mortality between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 5/371 (1%) versus 10/358 (3%) OR 0.51;95% CI 0.18 to 1.44). Neither was there a significant difference in the morbidity between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 76/371 (20%) versus 67/358 (19%) OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.62). Participants in the open surgery group had significantly fewer retained stones compared with the ERCP group (seven trials; 609 participants; 20/313 (6%) versus 47/296 (16%) OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.62), P = 0.0002. There was no significant difference in the mortality between LC + LCBDE versus pre‐operative ERCP +LC (five trials; 580 participants; 2/285 (0.7%) versus 3/295 (1%) OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.12 to 4.33). Neither was there was a significant difference in the morbidity between the two groups (five trials; 580 participants; 44/285 (15%) versus 37/295 (13%) OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.80 to 2.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of participants with retained stones (five trials; 580 participants; 24/285 (8%) versus 31/295 (11%) OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.39). There was only one trial assessing LC + LCBDE versus LC+intra‐operative ERCP including 234 participants. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity, retained stones, procedure failure rates between the two intervention groups. Two trials assessed LC + LCBDE versus LC+post‐operative ERCP. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 13/81 (16%) versus 12/85 (14%) OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.72). There was a significant difference in the retained stones between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 7/81 (9%) versus 21/85 (25%) OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.72; P = 0.008. In total, seven trials including 746 participants compared single staged LC + LCBDE versus two‐staged pre‐operative ERCP + LC or LC + post‐operative ERCP. There was no significant difference in the mortality between single and two‐stage management (seven trials; 746 participants; 2/366 versus 3/380 OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.12 to 4.33). There was no a significant difference in the morbidity (seven trials; 746 participants; 57/366 (16%) versus 49/380 (13%) OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.89). There were significantly fewer retained stones in the single‐stage group (31/366 participants; 8%) compared with the two‐stage group (52/380 participants; 14%), but the difference was not statistically significantOR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94). There was no significant difference in the conversion rates of LCBDE to open surgery when compared with pre‐operative, intra‐operative, and postoperative ERCP groups. Meta‐analysis of the outcomes duration of hospital stay, quality of life, and cost of the procedures could not be performed due to lack of data. Authors' conclusions Open bile duct surgery seems superior to ERCP in achieving common bile duct stone clearance based on the evidence available from the early endoscopy era. There is no significant difference in the mortality and morbidity between laparoscopic bile duct clearance and the endoscopic options. There is no significant reduction in the number of retained stones and failure rates in the laparoscopy groups compared with the pre‐operative and intra‐operative ERCP groups. There is no significant difference in the mortality, morbidity, retained stones, and failure rates between the single‐stage laparoscopic bile duct clearance and two‐stage endoscopic management. More randomised clinical trials without risks of systematic and random errors are necessary to confirm these findings.","Surgical versus endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones Background     Gallstones are a common problem in the general population and commonly cause problems with pain (biliary colic) and gallbladder infections (acute cholecystitis). Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder and become trapped in the tube between the gallbladder and the small bowel (common bile duct). Here, they obstruct the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel and cause pain, jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the eyes, dark urine, and pale stools), and sometimes severe infections of the bile (cholangitis). Between 10% and 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones. Treatment involves removal of the gallbladder as well as the gallstones from this tube. There are several methods to achieve this. Surgery is performed to remove the gallbladder. In the past, this was performed through a single large incision through the abdomen (open cholecystectomy). Newer keyhole techniques (laparoscopic surgery) are now the most common methods of removal of the gallbladder. Removal of the trapped gallstones in the common bile duct can be performed at the same time as the open or keyhole surgery. Alternatively, an endoscope (a narrow flexible tube equipped with a camera) is inserted through the mouth and into the small bowel to allow removal of the trapped gallstones from the common bile duct. This procedure can be performed before, during, and after the surgery to remove the gallbladder. This systematic review attempts to answer the question of the safest and most effective method to remove these trapped gallstones (in terms of open surgery or laparoscopic surgery compared with endoscopic removal), whether removal of the common bile duct stones should be performed during surgery to remove the gallbladder as a single‐stage treatment or as a separate treatment before or after surgery (two‐stage treatment). Review questions   We analysed results from randomised clinical trials in the literature to assess the benefits and harms of these procedures Quality of evidence     We identified a total of 16 trials including 1758 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias (defects in study design which may result in overestimation of benefits or underestimation of harms). Overall the quality of the evidence is moderate because of the risk of systematic errors or bias (defects in study design) and random errors (insufficient number of participants were included in the trials) which can result in wrong conclusions. Key results     Our analysis suggests open surgery to remove the gallbladder and trapped gallstones appears to be as safe as endoscopy and may even be more successful than the endoscopic technique in clearing the duct stones. Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery to remove the gallbladder and trapped gallstones appears to be as safe as and as effective as the endoscopic technique. More randomised clinical trials conducted with low risks of systematic errors (trials) and low risks of random errors (play of chances) are required to confirm or refute the present findings.",CD003327
"Background Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of back pain that can also give rise to pain in the buttock, thigh or leg, particularly when walking. Several possible treatments are available, of which surgery appears to be best at restoring function and reducing pain. Surgical outcome is not ideal, and a sizeable proportion of patients do not regain good function. No accepted evidence‐based approach to postoperative care is known—a fact thathas prompted this review. Objectives To determine whether active rehabilitation programmes following primary surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis have an impact on functional outcomes and whether such programmes are superior to 'usual postoperative care'. Search methods We searched the following databases from their first issues to March 2013: CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library,  most recent issue), the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDro. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of active rehabilitation versus usual care in adults (> 18 years of age) with confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis who had undergone spinal decompressive surgery (with or without fusion) for the first time. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials by using a predeveloped form. We contacted authors of original trials to request additional unpublished data as required. We recorded baseline characteristics of participants, interventions, comparisons, follow‐up and outcome measures to enable assessment of clinical homogeneity. Clinical relevance was independently assessed by using the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), and risk of bias within studies was determined by using CBRG criteria. We pooled individual study results in a meta‐analysis when appropriate. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) when the same measurement scales were used in all studies and the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measurement scales were used. Whenreported means and standard deviations of the outcomes showed that outcome data were skewed, we log‐transformed data for all studies in the comparison and performed a meta‐analysis on the log‐scale. Results of analyses performed on the log‐scale were converted back to the original scale. We used a fixed‐effect inverse variance model to measure treatment effect when no substantial evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found. When we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random‐effects inverse variance model. The primary outcome measure was functional status as measured by a back‐specific functional scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of leg pain, low back pain and global improvement/general health. We considered statistical significance and clinical relevance of outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome on the basis of five criteria, for which evidence was ranked from high to very low quality, depending on the number of criteria met. Main results Our searches yielded 1,726 results, and a total of three studies (N = 373 participants) were included in the review and meta‐analysis. All studies were deemed to have low risk of bias; no study had unacceptably high dropout rates. Also, no unacceptably unbalanced dropout rates, unacceptably low adherence rates or non‐adherence to the protocol or clearly significant unbalanced baseline differences were noted for the primary outcome. Outcomes in the short term (within six months postoperative) Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 340) shows that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD ‐0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.44 to 0.00, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 20%, 95% CI 0% to 36%) and for reported low back pain (log MD ‐0.18, 95% CI‐0.35 to ‐0.02, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 2% to 30%). In contrast, evidence of low quality suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care for leg pain (log MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.19, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 21% worsening to 41% improvement). Low‐quality evidence from two RCTs (N = 238) indicates that rehabilitation has no additional benefit on general health status as compared to usual care (MD 1.30, 95% CI ‐4.45 to 7.06). Outcomes in the long term (at 12 months postoperative) Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 373) shows that rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 23%, 95% CI 5% to 37%), for reported low back pain (log MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.36 to ‐0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 18%, 95% CI 5% to 30%]. Evidence of moderate quality (N = 373) and for leg pain (log MD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.01, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 21%, 95% CI 1% to 37%). In contrast, evidence of low quality from two studies (N = 273) suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care with respect to improvement in general health (MD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐6.41 to 5.4). None of the included papers reported any relevant adverse events. Authors' conclusions Evidence suggests that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care in improving both short‐ and long‐term (back‐related) functional status. Similar findings were noted for secondary outcomes, including short‐term improvement in low back pain and long‐term improvement in both low back pain and leg pain, although limited impact was observed in relation to improvements in general health status. The clinical relevance of these effects is medium to small. Our evaluation is limited by the small number of relevant studies identified, and further research is required.","Can exercise give better results after spinal surgery for spinal stenosis? Spinal stenosis occurs when the canal that the spinal nerves go through narrows and presses on nerves, causing pain in the back or legs. It tends to happen more often in older people. Surgery can help reduce the pressure, but although most patients find that their leg pain improves, back pain isn't always helped, and people still have problems carrying out everyday tasks. This review was done to find out whether a supervised  programme of exercise (a rehabilitation programme) after surgery was more helpful for patients in their everyday lives than the usual advice to stay active. We found that very little work had been done in this area; only three studies were suitable for inclusion. More than 300 participants were included in all. Each study involved a rehabilitation programme between 30 and 90 minutes long, provided once or twice weekly and starting six to 12 weeks after surgery. We found that specially designed exercise programmes for people who have had back decompression surgery can help to reduce back pain and can improve their ability to carry out everyday tasks. This was true both in the short term (within six months of surgery) and over the long term (at 12 months). Because only three studies were suitable to be included, we cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.",CD009644
"Background Thyrotropin‐releasing hormones (TRH) added to prenatal corticosteroids has been suggested as a way to further reduce breathing problems and neonatal lung disease in infants born preterm. Objectives To assess the effects of giving prenatal TRH in addition to corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth for the prevention of neonatal respiratory disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted trial authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in women at sufficient risk of preterm birth to warrant the use of prenatal corticosteroids to promote lung maturity. TRH and corticosteroids were compared with corticosteroids, with or without placebo. Data collection and analysis All assessments of trial eligibility, risk of bias and data extractions were independently carried out by at least two review authors. Main results Over 4600 women were recruited into the 15 trials included in the review, however two trials did not contribute any outcome data to the review. The trials had a moderate risk of bias. Overall, prenatal TRH, in addition to corticosteroids, did not reduce the risk of death prior to hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.27, six trials, 3694 infants), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22, nine trials, 3833 infants), or chronic lung disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19, five trials, 2511 infants), and did not improve any of the secondary fetal, neonatal or childhood outcomes assessed by intention‐to‐treat analyses. Indeed, the data showed prenatal TRH to have adverse effects for women and their infants. All side effects reported (nausea, vomiting, light headedness, urgency of micturition, facial flushing) were significantly more likely to occur in women receiving TRH. In the infants, prenatal TRH increased the risk of needing respiratory support (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, three trials, 1969 infants), and of having a low Apgar score at five minutes (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.92, three trials, 1969 infants). Only three trials provided data on childhood follow‐up, and while one trial suggested poorer outcomes for infants who were exposed to prenatal TRH, the other two trials, that assessed infants using an established developmental instrument, showed no clear differences between groups in follow‐up outcomes. Sensitivity analyses by trial quality, or subgroups with differing times from entry to birth, or different dose regimens of TRH, did not change these findings. Authors' conclusions Prenatal TRH in addition to corticosteroids, given to women at risk of preterm birth, does not improve infant outcomes and can cause maternal side effects.","Thyrotropin‐releasing hormone added to corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease Thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) given with corticosteroids does not improve the benefit of corticosteroids on the lungs of babies born too early, and may increase harm. Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are at risk of breathing difficulties (such as respiratory distress syndrome). TRH increases thyroid hormones in the baby and it has been thought that adding TRH to corticosteroids for women giving birth early may increase the benefit of corticosteroids on the baby's lungs. This review included 15 trials, of a moderate risk of bias, that involved over 4600 women and their babies. In this review, TRH, given with corticosteroids to women at risk of early birth, was not shown to further reduce the breathing difficulties for the babies. Babies born to mothers who had received TRH with corticosteroids, were more likely to require support for breathing than babies born to mothers who received only corticosteroids. Women receiving TRH were more likely to experience adverse side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and flushing than women who only received corticosteroids. Therefore, based on the current available evidence, TRH is not recommended to be given to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease.",CD000019
"Background Antiepileptic drugs have been used for treating different types of neuropathic pain, and sometimes fibromyalgia. Our understanding of quality standards in chronic pain trials has improved to include new sources of potential bias. Individual Cochrane reviews using these new standards have assessed individual antiepileptic drugs. An early review from this group, originally published in 1998, was titled 'Anticonvulsants for acute and chronic pain'. This overview now covers the neuropathic pain aspect of that original review, which was withdrawn in 2009. Objectives To provide an overview of the relative analgesic efficacy of antiepileptic drugs that have been compared with placebo in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to report on adverse events associated with their use. Methods We included reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  up to August 2013 (Issue 7). We extracted information from each review on measures of efficacy and harm, and methodological details concerning the number of participants, the duration of studies, and the imputation methods used, in order to judge potential biases in available data. We analysed efficacy data for each painful condition in three tiers, according to outcome and freedom from known sources of bias. The first tier met current best standards ‐ at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent), without the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) for dropouts, an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, in parallel group studies with at least 200 participants lasting eight weeks or more. The second tier used data from at least 200 participants where one or more of the above conditions were not met. The third tier of evidence related to data from fewer than 200 participants, or with several important methodological problems that limited interpretation. Main results No studies reported top tier results. For gabapentin and pregabalin only we found reasonably good second tier evidence for efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. In addition, for pregabalin, we found evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTs) were in the range of 4 to 10 for the important outcome of pain intensity reduction over baseline of 50% or more. For other antiepileptic drugs there was no evidence (clonazepam, phenytoin), so little evidence that no sensible judgement could be made about efficacy (valproic acid), low quality evidence likely to be subject to a number of biases overestimating efficacy (carbamazepine), or reasonable quality evidence indicating little or no effect (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate). Lacosamide recorded such a trivial statistical superiority over placebo that it was unreliable to conclude that it had any efficacy where there was possible substantial bias. Any benefits of treatment came with a high risk of adverse events and withdrawal because of adverse events, but serious adverse events were not significantly raised, except with oxcarbazepine. Authors' conclusions Clinical trial evidence supported the use of only gabapentin and pregabalin in some neuropathic pain conditions (painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain) and fibromyalgia. Only a minority of people achieved acceptably good pain relief with either drug, but it is known that quality of life and function improved markedly with the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction. For other antiepileptic drugs there was no evidence, insufficient evidence, or evidence of a lack of effect; this included carbamazepine. Evidence from clinical practice and experience is that some patients can achieve good results with antiepileptics other than gabapentin or pregabalin. There is no firm evidence to answer the important pragmatic questions about which patients should have which drug, and in which order the drugs should be used. There is a clinical effectiveness research agenda to provide evidence about strategies rather than interventions, to produce the overall best results in a population, in the shortest time, and at the lowest cost to healthcare providers.","Antiepileptic drugs to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia‐ an overview of Cochrane reviews Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (eg a fall, cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen are probably not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is lacking, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain. Antiepileptic drugs (previously called anticonvulsants) are used for treating epilepsy, but have also been used for treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Many of the drugs have been the subject of individual Cochrane reviews. In August 2013 we collected all these Cochrane reviews on antiepileptic drugs together to provide an overview. Individual antiepileptic drugs work in different ways, and there is no expectation that they are equally effective. We found that only for gabapentin and pregabalin was there some evidence that they worked in long‐term nerve pain with diabetes (painful diabetic neuropathy) and pain after shingles (postherpetic neuralgia). Pregabalin also had evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain (typically pain after stroke) and in fibromyalgia. The drugs work very well in some people with these painful conditions, with pain reduced by half. However, only between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 people will get this level of benefit, depending on the pain condition and the drug. Most people will get no pain relief. The antiepileptic drugs produced side effects in most people taking them, and for about 1 in 4 these could not be tolerated so they stopped taking the drug. Serious side effects were no more common with antiepileptic drugs than with a harmless placebo. The evidence we found did not meet current best standards, and as a result it may overestimate benefit. The biggest concern is a lack of any evidence for most drugs in most types of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For lacosamide and lamotrigine there is evidence of a lack of effect; for other antiepileptic drugs (including carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, valproate) there is no evidence of effect or insufficient evidence of effect.",CD010567
"Background Calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy is one of the types of tocolytic therapy that may be used after an episode of threatened preterm labour (and usually an initial dose of tocolytic therapy) in an attempt to prevent the onset of further preterm contractions. Objectives To assess the effects of calcium channel blockers as maintenance therapy on preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of calcium channel blockers used as maintenance therapy to prevent preterm birth after threatened preterm labour, compared with placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Main results We included six trials that enrolled 794 women and their babies and all assessed nifedipine as calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy. The six trials were judged to be at a moderate risk of bias overall. No differences in the incidence of preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.09; five trials, 681 women), birth within 48 hours of treatment (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.07 to 3.00; two trials, 128 women) or neonatal mortality (average RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.05 to 11.76; two trials, 133 infants) were seen when nifedipine maintenance therapy was compared with placebo or no treatment. No stillbirths were reported in the one trial that provided data for this outcome. No trials reported on longer‐term follow‐up of infants. Women receiving nifedipine maintenance therapy were significantly more likely to have their pregnancy prolonged (mean difference (MD) 5.35 days; 95% CI 0.49 to 10.21; four trials, 275 women); however, no differences between groups were shown for birth at less than 34 weeks' gestation, birth at less than 28 weeks' gestation, birth within seven days of treatment, or gestational age at birth. No significant differences were shown between the nifedipine and control groups for any of the secondary neonatal morbidities reported. Similarly, no significant differences were seen for the outcomes relating to the use of health services, except for in one trial, where infants whose mothers received nifedipine were significantly more likely to have a longer length of hospital stay as compared with infants born to mothers who received a placebo (MD 14.00 days; 95% CI 4.21 to 23.79; 60 infants). Authors' conclusions Based on the current available evidence, maintenance treatment with a calcium channel blocker after threatened preterm labour does not prevent preterm birth or improve maternal or infant outcomes.","Maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers for preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour Calcium channel blockers have not been shown to reduce preterm birth or improve the outcomes for babies when given to women after contractions of preterm labour have been stopped. Babies born premature (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) may not survive, or may have serious long‐term problems if they do survive. Women who have had their preterm labour stopped with tocolytic treatment (medication to reduce uterine contractions), remain at risk of giving birth preterm. After this initial tocolytic treatment has been given to stop early labour, a maintenance tocolytic treatment may be given to try to prevent further early contractions and early birth. Calcium channel blockers are one of the types of tocolytic therapy that have been used in an attempt to prevent the onset of further preterm contractions. We identified six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 794 women and their babies for this review. The trials were of moderate risk of bias overall. The trials did not demonstrate differences between calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy and placebo or no treatment in the prevention of preterm birth or perinatal death (fetal or neonatal deaths). None of the trials included any follow‐up of the infants to assess longer‐term development. Calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy (with a drug called nifedipine) was more likely than placebo or no treatment to prolong pregnancy, however the infants of these mothers were more likely to have a longer hospital stay. Based on the current studies, we found no convincing evidence that calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy prevents preterm birth for women after threatened preterm labour, or that it improves outcomes for babies.",CD004071
"Background Urodynamic tests are used to investigate people who have urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms in order to make a definitive, objective diagnosis. The aim is to help select the treatment most likely to be successful. The investigations are invasive and time consuming. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine if treatment according to a urodynamic‐based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of people with urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes. The intention was to test the following hypotheses in predefined subgroups of people with incontinence:  (i) urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes; (ii) urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making; (iii) one type of urodynamic test is better than another in improving the outcomes of management of incontinence or influencing clinical decisions, or both. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 19 February 2013), and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes in groups of people who were and were not investigated using urodynamics, or comparing one type of urodynamic test against another were included. Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Eight trials involving around 1100 people were included but data were only available for 1036 women in seven trials, of whom 526 received urodynamics. There was some evidence of risk of bias. The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained. There was significant evidence that the tests did change clinical decision making. Women in the urodynamic arms of three trials were more likely to have their management changed (proportion with change in management compared with the control arm 17% versus 3%, risk ratio (RR) 5.07, 95% CI 1.87 to 13.74), although there was statistical heterogeneity. There was evidence from two trials that women treated after urodynamic investigations were more likely to receive drugs (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.31). On the other hand, in five trials women undergoing treatment following urodynamic investigation were not more likely to undergo surgery (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12). There was no statistically significant difference however in the number of women with urinary incontinence if they received treatment guided by urodynamics (37%) compared with those whose treatment was based on history and clinical findings alone (36%) (for example, RR for the number with incontinence after the first year 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21). It was calculated that the number of women needed to treat was 100 women (95% CI 86 to 114 women) undergoing urodynamics to prevent one extra individual being incontinent at one year. One trial reported adverse effects and no significant difference was found (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50). Authors' conclusions While urodynamic tests did change clinical decision making, there was some evidence that this did not result in better outcomes in terms of a difference in urinary incontinence rates after treatment. There was no evidence about their use in men, children, or people with neurological diseases. Larger definitive trials are needed in which people are randomly allocated to management according to urodynamic findings or to management based on history and clinical examination to determine if performance of urodynamics results in higher continence rates after treatment.","Urodynamic studies (tests) for the management of urinary incontinence in children and adults Urinary incontinence is defined as the involuntary loss of urine and is the inability to retain urine in the bladder between voluntary acts of urination. It has a number of different causes. Urodynamic tests are used to measure nerve and muscle function, pressure around and in the bladder, flow rates, and other factors which might help to explain why someone leaks urine or what type of leakage they have. Some people find these tests embarrassing and uncomfortable. However, they might show what the cause of the incontinence is, or what sort of incontinence the person has, so that the correct treatment can be chosen. This might improve the success of the treatment. Eight trials were found, which included around 1100 people, although information was only available for 1036 women. There was not enough evidence to determine whether the urodynamic tests led to better outcomes. There was some evidence that urodynamic testing increased the number of people given drugs but not the number of people undergoing surgery. This did not result in any difference in the number of people who leaked urine, and it was not known whether they had a better quality of life. More research is needed in which people are randomised to having treatment decisions based on either their symptoms and examination alone or after taking into account the extra information provided by urodynamic tests.",CD003195
"Background Partner notification (PN) is the process whereby sexual partners of an index patient are informed of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the need to obtain treatment. For the person (index patient) with a curable STI, PN aims to eradicate infection and prevent re‐infection. For sexual partners, PN aims to identify and treat undiagnosed STIs. At the level of sexual networks and populations, the aim of PN is to interrupt chains of STI transmission. For people with viral STI, PN aims to identify undiagnosed infections, which can facilitate access for their sexual partners to treatment and help prevent transmission. Objectives To assess the effects of different PN strategies in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Search methods We searched electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE) without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists of potential studies and previous reviews and contacted experts in the field. We searched three trial registries. We conducted the most recent search on 31 August 2012. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing two or more PN strategies. Four main PN strategies were included: patient referral, expedited partner therapy, provider referral and contract referral. Patient referral means that the patient notifies their sexual partners, either with (enhanced patient referral) or without (simple patient referral) additional verbal or written support. In expedited partner therapy, the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. In provider referral, health service personnel notify the partners. In contract referral, the index patient is encouraged to notify partner, with the understanding that the partners will be contacted if they do not visit the health service by a certain date. Data collection and analysis We analysed data according to paired partner referral strategies. We organised the comparisons first according to four main PN strategies (1. enhanced patient referral, 2. expedited partner therapy, 3. contract referral, 4. provider referral). We compared each main strategy with simple patient referral and then with each other, if trials were available. For continuous outcome measures, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome re‐infection rate of the index patient by excluding studies with attrition of greater than 20%. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included 26 trials (17,578 participants, 9015 women and 8563 men). Five trials were conducted in developing countries. Only two trials were conducted among HIV‐positive patients. There was potential for selection bias, owing to the methods of allocation used and of performance bias, owing to the lack of blinding in most included studies. Seven trials had attrition of greater than 20%, increasing the risk of bias. The review found moderate‐quality evidence that expedited partner therapy is better than simple patient referral for preventing re‐infection of index patients when combining trials of STIs that caused urethritis or cervicitis (6 trials; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, I 2  = 39%). When studies with attrition greater than 20% were excluded, the effect of expedited partner therapy was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04, I 2  = 0%). In trials restricted to index patients with chlamydia, the effect was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35, I 2  = 22%). Expedited partner therapy also increased the number of partners treated per index patient (three trials) when compared with simple patient referral in people with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58) or trichomonas (MD 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), and people with any STI syndrome (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.67). Expedited partner therapy was not superior to enhanced patient referral in preventing re‐infection (3 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.53, I 2  = 33%, low‐quality evidence). Home sampling kits for partners (four trials) did not result in lower rates of re‐infection in the index case (measured in one trial), or higher numbers of partners elicited (three trials), notified (two trials) or treated (one trial) when compared with simple patient referral. There was no consistent evidence for the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods. In one trial among men with non‐gonococcal urethritis, more partners were treated with provider referral than with simple patient referral (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63). In one study among people with syphilis, contract referral elicited treatment of more partners than provider referral (MD 2.2, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.45), but the number of partners receiving treatment was the same in both groups. Where measured, there was no statistical evidence of differences in the incidence of adverse effects between PN strategies. Authors' conclusions The evidence assessed in this review does not identify a single optimal strategy for PN for any particular STI. When combining trials of STI causing urethritis or cervicitis, expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral for preventing re‐infection of the index patient but was not superior to enhanced patient referral. Expedited partner therapy interventions should include all components that were part of the trial intervention package. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective components of an enhanced patient referral strategy. There are too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More high‐quality RCTs of PN strategies for HIV and syphilis, using biological outcomes, are needed.","Strategies for partner notification for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are a major global cause of acute illness, infertility and death. Every year there are an estimated 499 million new cases of the most common curable STIs (trichomoniasis, chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea), and between two and three million new cases of HIV. The presence of several STIs, including syphilis and herpes can increase the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Partner notification (PN) is a process whereby sexual partners of patients given a diagnosis of STI are informed of their exposure to infection and the need to receive treatment. PN for curable STI may prevent re‐infection of the patient and reduce the risk of complications and further spread. A review update of the research of the strategies of partner notification in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was conducted by researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 26 studies. This review covers four main PN strategies: 1) Patient referral means that the patient tells their sexual partners that they need to be treated, either with (enhanced) or without (simple) additional support to enhance outcomes. 2) Expedited partner therapy means that the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. 3) Provider referral means that health service personnel notify the partners. 4) Contract referral means that the patient is encouraged to notify partners but health service personnel will contact them if they do not visit the health service by a certain date. The 26 trials in this review included 17,578 participants. Five trials were conducted in developing countries and only two trials were performed among HIV‐positive patients. Expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral in reducing repeat infection in patients with gonorrhoea, chlamydia or non‐gonococcal urethritis (six trials). Expedited partner therapy and enhanced patient referral resulted in similar levels of repeat infection (three trials). Evidence about the effects of home sampling, where patients with chlamydia received a sample kit for the partner, was inconsistent (three trials). There were too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More studies need to be performed on HIV and syphilis and harms need to be measured and reported.",CD002843
"Background Depression is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Depression is commonly treated with antidepressants and/or psychological therapy, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. There are a number of theoretical reasons why exercise may improve depression. This is an update of an earlier review first published in 2009. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression in adults compared with no treatment or a comparator intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group’s Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 13 July 2012. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years); MEDLINE (1950 to date); EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched www.controlled‐trials.com, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No date or language restrictions were applied to the search. We conducted an additional search of the CCDANCTR up to 1st March 2013 and any potentially eligible trials not already included are listed as 'awaiting classification.' Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in which exercise (defined according to American College of Sports Medicine criteria) was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment, pharmacological treatment, psychological treatment or other active treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We included cluster trials and those that randomised individuals. We excluded trials of postnatal depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data on primary and secondary outcomes at the end of the trial and end of follow‐up (if available). We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Hedges'  g  method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random‐effects model risk ratio for dichotomous data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta‐analysis. Where trials provided several 'doses' of exercise, we used data from the biggest 'dose' of exercise, and performed sensitivity analyses using the lower 'dose'. We performed subgroup analyses to explore the influence of method of diagnosis of depression (diagnostic interview or cut‐off point on scale), intensity of exercise and the number of sessions of exercise on effect sizes. Two authors performed the 'Risk of bias' assessments. Our sensitivity analyses explored the influence of study quality on outcome. Main results Thirty‐nine trials (2326 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 37 provided data for meta‐analyses. There were multiple sources of bias in many of the trials; randomisation was adequately concealed in 14 studies, 15 used intention‐to‐treat analyses and 12 used blinded outcome assessors. For the 35 trials (1356 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD for the primary outcome of depression at the end of treatment was ‐0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.81 to ‐0.42), indicating a moderate clinical effect. There was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 63%). When we included only the six trials (464 participants) with adequate allocation concealment, intention‐to‐treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD for this outcome was not statistically significant (‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.11). Pooled data from the eight trials (377 participants) providing long‐term follow‐up data on mood found a small effect in favour of exercise (SMD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.03). Twenty‐nine trials reported acceptability of treatment, three trials reported quality of life, none reported cost, and six reported adverse events. For acceptability of treatment (assessed by number of drop‐outs during the intervention), the risk ratio was 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.04). Seven trials compared exercise with psychological therapy (189 participants), and found no significant difference (SMD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.26). Four trials (n = 300) compared exercise with pharmacological treatment and found no significant difference (SMD ‐0.11, ‐0.34, 0.12). One trial (n = 18) reported that exercise was more effective than bright light therapy (MD ‐6.40, 95% CI ‐10.20 to ‐2.60). For each trial that was included, two authors independently assessed for sources of bias in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool. In exercise trials, there are inherent difficulties in blinding both those receiving the intervention and those delivering the intervention. Many trials used participant self‐report rating scales as a method for post‐intervention analysis, which also has the potential to bias findings. Authors' conclusions Exercise is moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression, but analysis of methodologically robust trials only shows a smaller effect in favour of exercise. When compared to psychological or pharmacological therapies, exercise appears to be no more effective, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials.","Exercise for depression Why is this review important? Depression is a common and disabling illness, affecting over 100 million people worldwide. Depression can have a significant impact on people’s physical health, as well as reducing their quality of life. Research has shown that both pharmacological and psychological therapies can be effective in treating depression. However, many people prefer to try alternative treatments. Some NHS guidelines suggest that exercise could be used as a different treatment choice. However, it is not clear if research actually shows that exercise is an effective treatment for depression. Who may be interested in this review? Patients and families affected by depression.  General Practitioners.  Mental health policy makers.  Professionals working in mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2010 which suggested that exercise can reduce symptoms of depression, but the effect was small and did not seem to last after participants stopped exercising. We wanted to find out if more trials of the effect of exercise as a treatment for depression have been conducted since our last review that allow us to answer the following questions: Is exercise more effective than no therapy for reducing symptoms of depression?  Is exercise more effective than antidepressant medication for reducing symptoms of depression?  Is exercise more effective than psychological therapies or other non‐medical treatments for depression?  How acceptable to patients is exercise as a treatment for depression? Which studies were included in the review? We used search databases to find all high‐quality randomised controlled trials of how effective exercise is for treating depression in adults over 18 years of age. We searched for studies published up until March 2013. We also searched for ongoing studies to March 2013. All studies had to include adults with a diagnosis of depression, and the physical activity carried out had to fit criteria to ensure that it met with a definition of ‘exercise’. We included 39 studies with a total of 2326 participants in the review. The reviewers noted that the quality of some of the studies was low, which limits confidence in the findings. When only high‐quality trials were included, exercise had only a small effect on mood that was not statistically significant. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Exercise is moderately more effective than no therapy for reducing symptoms of depression.  Exercise is no more effective than antidepressants for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on a small number of studies.   Exercise is no more effective than psychological therapies for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on small number of studies.  The reviewers also note that when only high‐quality studies were included, the difference between exercise and no therapy is less conclusive.  Attendance rates for exercise treatments ranged from 50% to 100%.  The evidence about whether exercise for depression improves quality of life is inconclusive. What should happen next? The reviewers recommend that future research should look in more detail at what types of exercise could most benefit people with depression, and the number and duration of sessions which are of most benefit. Further larger trials are needed to find out whether exercise is as effective as antidepressants or psychological treatments.",CD004366
"Background Physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy aims to improve work status for workers on sick leave due to back pain. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review (originally titled 'Work conditioning, work hardening and functional restoration for workers with back and neck pain') first published in 2003, updated in 2010, and updated again in 2013. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in reducing time lost from work and improving work status for workers with back pain. Further, to assess which aspects of physical conditioning are related to a faster return to work for workers with back pain. Search methods We searched the following databases to March 2012: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), PsycINFO (from 1967), and PEDro. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs that studied workers with work disability related to back pain and who were included in physical conditioning programmes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 41 articles reporting on 25 RCTs with 4404 participants. Risk of bias was low in 16 studies. Three studies involved workers with acute back pain, eight studies workers with subacute back pain, and 14 studies workers with chronic back pain. In 14 studies, physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy was compared to usual care. The physical conditioning mostly consisted of graded activity with work‐related exercises aimed at increasing back strength and flexibility, together with a set date for return to work. The programmes were divided into a light version with a maximum of five sessions, or an intense version with more than five sessions up to full time or as inpatient treatment. For acute back pain, there was low quality evidence that both light and intense physical conditioning programmes made little or no difference in sickness absence duration compared with care as usual at three to 12 months follow‐up (3 studies with 340 workers). For subacute back pain, the evidence on the effectiveness of intense physical conditioning combined with care as usual compared to usual care alone was conflicting (four studies with 395 workers). However, subgroup analysis showed low quality evidence that if the intervention was executed at the workplace, or included a workplace visit, it may have reduced sickness absence duration at 12 months follow‐up (3 studies with 283 workers; SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.18). For chronic back pain, there was low quality evidence that physical conditioning as part of integrated care management in addition to usual care may have reduced sickness absence days compared to usual care at 12 months follow‐up (1 study, 134 workers; SMD ‐4.42, 95% CI ‐5.06 to ‐3.79). What part of the integrated care management was most effective remained unclear. There was moderate quality evidence that intense physical conditioning probably reduced sickness absence duration only slightly compared with usual care at 12 months follow‐up (5 studies, 1093 workers; SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.03). Physical conditioning compared to exercise therapy showed conflicting results for workers with subacute and chronic back pain. Cognitive behavioural therapy was probably not superior to physical conditioning as an alternative or in addition to physical conditioning. Authors' conclusions The effectiveness of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in reducing sick leave for workers with back pain, compared to usual care or exercise therapy, remains uncertain. For workers with acute back pain, physical conditioning may have no effect on sickness absence duration. There is conflicting evidence regarding the reduction of sickness absence duration with intense physical conditioning versus usual care for workers with subacute back pain. It may be that including workplace visits or execution of the intervention at the workplace is the component that renders a physical conditioning programme effective. For workers with chronic back pain physical conditioning has a small effect on reducing sick leave compared to care as usual after 12 months follow‐up. To what extent physical conditioning as part of integrated care management may alter the effect on sick leave for workers with chronic back pain needs further research.","Physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy to reduce sickness absence for workers with back pain Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in people with low back pain. We found 25 studies. Background The main goal of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy, sometimes called work conditioning, work hardening or functional restoration and exercise programmes, is to return injured or disabled workers to work or improve the work status for workers performing modified duties. Such programmes may also simulate or duplicate work or functional tasks, or both, using exercises in a safe, supervised environment. These exercises or tasks are structured and progressively graded to increase psychological, physical and emotional tolerance and to improve endurance and work feasibility. In such environments, injured workers improve their general physical condition through an exercise programme aimed at increasing strength, endurance, flexibility and cardiovascular fitness. We wanted to discover whether physical conditioning was more or less effective than usual care and other types of interventions like exercise therapy. Study characteristics The evidence was current to March 2012. We analysed 17 comparisons of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy. Some trials examined physical conditioning in addition to care as usual versus care as usual only, and others compared physical conditioning to other types of interventions such as standard exercise therapy. Participants had either acute back pain (duration of symptoms less than six weeks), subacute back pain (duration of symptoms more than six but less than 12 weeks), or chronic back pain (duration of symptoms more than 12 weeks). Participants were followed for anywhere from three weeks to three years. We divided physical conditioning into light or intense, depending on its intensity and duration. Key results Results showed that light physical conditioning has no effect on sickness absence duration for workers with subacute or chronic back pain. We found conflicting results for intense physical conditioning for workers with subacute back pain. Intense physical conditioning probably had a small effect on reducing sick leave at 12 months follow‐up compared to usual care for workers with chronic back pain. Involving the workplace, or physical conditioning being part of integrated care management may have had a positive effect on reducing sick leave, but this needs further research. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Although 16 of the included studies were well designed and had no major flaws, some studies were poorly conducted and the small number of participants in most studies lowered the overall quality of the evidence.",CD001822
"Background Male factors leading to subfertility account for at least half of all cases of subfertility worldwide. Although some causes of male subfertility are treatable, treatment of idiopathic male factor subfertility remains empirical. Researchers have used gonadotrophins to improve sperm parameters in idiopathic male factor subfertility with the ultimate goal of increasing birth and pregnancy rates, but results have been conflicting. Objectives To determine the effect of systemic follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) on live birth and pregnancy rates when administered to men with idiopathic male factor subfertility . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (14 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library , Issue 12 of 12, 2012), Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 14 January 2013), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to week 2 of 2013), Ovid PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 of 2013), trial registers for ongoing and registered trials at ClinicalTrials.gov (19 January 2013), the World Health Organisation International Trials Registry Platform (19 January 2013), The Cochrane Library Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (19 January 2013) and OpenGrey for grey literature from Europe (19 January 2013). Searches were not limited by language. Bibliographies of included and excluded trials and abstracts of major meetings were searched for additional trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which gonadotrophins were compared with placebo or no treatment for participants with idiopathic male factor subfertility. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data on live birth, pregnancy and adverse effects. We included data on pregnancies that occurred during or after gonadotrophin therapy. Study authors and pharmaceutical companies were asked to provide missing and unpublished data and/or additional information. Main results Six RCTs with 456 participants and variable treatment and follow‐up periods were included. From the limited data, the live birth rate per couple randomly assigned (27% vs 0%; Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 73.75, one study, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence) and the spontaneous pregnancy rate per couple randomly assigned (16% vs 7%; Peto OR 4.94, 95% CI 2.13 to 11.44, five studies, 412 participants, I 2  = 0%, moderate‐quality evidence) were significantly higher in men receiving gonadotrophin treatment than in men receiving placebo or no treatment. No significant difference between groups was noted when intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) was performed. None of the included studies reported miscarriage rates, and adverse events data were sparse. Authors' conclusions Encouraging preliminary data suggest a beneficial effect on live birth and pregnancy of gonadotrophin treatment for men with idiopathic male factor subfertility, but because the numbers of trials and participants are small, evidence is insufficient to allow final conclusions. Large multi‐centre trials with adequate numbers of participants are needed.","Gonadotrophins for idiopathic male factor subfertility Background Male subfertility contributes to at least 50% of subfertility in couples. Around 39% of subfertile men have idiopathic subfertility (male subfertility with an unknown cause or origin). Gonadotrophins (hormones that stimulate sperm production) have been used in the treatment of men with this condition, but results have been inconsistent. We reviewed the evidence. Study characteristics We found six randomised controlled trials, with 456 participants. Key results There was a trend towards an increase in live birth and pregnancy rates during and within three months of gonadotrophin treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low. We did not find enough studies to allow final conclusions about the use of gonadotrophins in the treatment of men with idiopathic male factor subfertility. The quality of the evidence was very low. More studies on this subject are needed. The evidence is current to January 2013.",CD005071
"Background Traction has been used to treat low‐back pain (LBP), often in combination with other treatments. We included both manual and machine‐delivered traction in this review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, and previously updated in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of traction compared to placebo, sham traction, reference treatments and no treatment in people with LBP. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (January 2006 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2012), CINAHL (January 2006 to August 2012), and reference lists of articles and personal files. The review authors are not aware of any important new randomized controlled trial (RCTs) on this topic since the date of the last search. Selection criteria RCTs involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) non‐specific LBP with or without sciatica. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a descriptive analysis. We did not find any case series that identified adverse effects, therefore we evaluated adverse effects that were reported in the included studies. Main results We included 32 RCTs involving 2762 participants in this review. We considered 16 trials, representing 57% of all participants, to have a low risk of bias based on the Cochrane Back Review Group's 'Risk of bias' tool. For people with mixed symptom patterns (acute, subacute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica), there was low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work when compared to placebo, sham traction or no treatment. Similarly, when comparing the combination of physiotherapy plus traction with physiotherapy alone or when comparing traction with other treatments, there was very‐low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. For people with LBP with sciatica and acute, subacute or chronic pain, there was low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that traction probably has no impact on pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. This was true when traction was compared with controls and other treatments, as well as when the combination of traction plus physiotherapy was compared with physiotherapy alone. No studies reported the effect of traction on return to work. For chronic LBP without sciatica, there was moderate‐quality evidence that traction probably makes little or no difference in pain intensity when compared with sham treatment. No studies reported on the effect of traction on functional status, global improvement or return to work. Adverse effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies. These included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects. The remaining studies did not mention adverse effects. Authors' conclusions These findings indicate that traction, either alone or in combination with other treatments, has little or no impact on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement and return to work among people with LBP. There is only limited‐quality evidence from studies with small sample sizes and moderate to high risk of bias. The effects shown by these studies are small and are not clinically relevant. Implications for practice   To date, the use of traction as treatment for non‐specific LBP cannot be motivated by the best available evidence. These conclusions are applicable to both manual and mechanical traction. Implications for research   Only new, large, high‐quality studies may change the point estimate and its accuracy, but it should be noted that such change may not necessarily favour traction. Therefore, little priority should be given to new studies on the effect of traction treatment alone or as part of a package.","Traction for low‐back pain We reviewed the evidence on the effect of traction on pain intensity, ability to perform normal daily activities, overall improvement and return to work among people with low back pain (LBP) in the acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (from four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) phase. Some patients also had sciatica. We examined the effects of traction immediately after the traction session, in the short‐term (up to three months after traction) and in the long‐term (around one year after traction). LBP is a major health problem around the world and is a major cause of medical expenses, absenteeism and disability. One treatment option for LBP that has been used for thousands of years is traction, the application of a force that draws two adjacent bones apart from each other in order to increase their shared joint space. Various types of traction are used, often in combination with other treatments. The most commonly used traction techniques are mechanical or motorized traction (where the traction is exerted by a motorized pulley) and manual traction (in which the traction is exerted by the therapist, using his or her body weight to alter the force and direction of the pull). The evidence is current to August 2012. The review included 32 studies and 2762 people with LBP. Most studies included a similar population of people with LBP with and without sciatica. The majority of studies included people with acute, subacute and chronic LBP. Most studies reported follow‐up of one to 16 weeks, and a limited number of studies reported long‐term follow‐up of six months to one year. The included studies show that traction as a single treatment or in combination with physiotherapy is no more effective in treating LBP than sham (pretend) treatment, physiotherapy without traction or other treatment methods including exercise, laser, ultrasound and corsets. These conclusions are valid for people with and without sciatica. There was no difference regarding the type of traction (manual or mechanical). Side effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies and included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no side effects. The remaining studies did not mention side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. There was a scarcity of high‐quality studies, especially those that distinguished between people with different symptom patterns (with and without sciatica, with pain of different duration).",CD003010
"Background By improving two social determinants of health (poverty and unemployment) in low‐ and middle‐income families on or at risk of welfare, in‐work tax credit for families (IWTC) interventions could impact health status and outcomes in adults. Objectives To assess the effects of IWTCs on health outcomes in working‐age adults (18 to 64 years). Search methods We searched 16 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as six grey literature databases between July and September 2012 for records published between January 1980 and July 2012. We also searched key organisational websites, handsearched reference lists of included records and relevant journals, and contacted academic experts. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cohort, controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of IWTCs in working‐age adults. Included primary outcomes were: self rated general health; mental health/psychological distress; mental illness; overweight/obesity; alcohol use and tobacco use. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. Main results Five studies (one CBA and four ITS) comprising a total of 5,677,383 participants (all women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were synthesised narratively. The in‐work tax credit intervention assessed in all included studies is the permanent Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States, established in 1975. This intervention distributed nearly USD 62 billion to over 27 million individuals in 2011, and its administration costs were less than one per cent of its total costs. All included studies carried a high risk of bias (especially from confounding and insufficient control for underlying time trends). Due to the small number of (observational) studies and their high risk of bias, we judged this body of evidence to have very low overall quality. One study found that IWTC had no detectable effect on self rated general health and mental health/psychological distress five years after its implementation (i.e. a considerable change in the generosity of the permanent IWTC) and on overweight/obesity eight years after implementation. One study found no effect of IWTC on tobacco use five years after implementation, one a moderate reduction in tobacco use one year after implementation (odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.96), and one differential effects, with no effect in African‐Americans and a large reduction in European‐Americans two years after implementation (risk difference ‐11.1%, 95% CI ‐20.9% to ‐1.3%). No evidence was available for the effect of IWTC on mental illness and alcohol use. No adverse effects of IWTC were identified. One study also found no detectable effect of IWTC on the number of bad physical health days and of risky biomarkers for inflammation, cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions eight years after implementation. One study found that IWTC had a large, positive effect on income from wages or salaries one year after implementation. Two studies found no effect on employment two and five years after implementation, whereas two found a moderate increase five and eight years after implementation and one a large increase in employment due to IWTC one year after implementation. No differences in outcomes between groups with different educational status were found for self rated health and mental health/psychological distress. In one study European‐American women with lower levels of education were more likely to reduce tobacco use, while tobacco use did not change among African‐American women with lower levels of education. However, no differences in tobacco use by educational status were observed in a second study. Two studies found that the intervention may have reduced inequity with respect to employment, where women with less education were more likely to move into employment (although one did not establish whether this difference was statistically significant), while two studies found no such difference and no studies found differences by ethnic group on employment rates. Authors' conclusions In summary, the small and methodologically limited existing body of evidence with a high risk of bias provides no evidence for an effect of in‐work tax credit for families interventions on health status (except for mixed evidence for tobacco smoking) in adults.","Employment‐conditional tax credits for families and their impact on health status in adults For low‐ and middle‐income families, in‐work tax credit for families (IWTC) interventions to reduce poverty and unemployment (both of which are thought to harm health) could be expected to improve health status in adults. This review sought to assess the effects of IWTCs on health outcomes in working‐age adults (18 to 64 years). The review included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cohort, controlled before‐and‐after and interrupted time series studies of IWTCs in working‐age adults. We looked for studies which reported adult self rated general health; mental health/psychological distress; mental illness; overweight/obesity; alcohol use and tobacco use. Five studies comprising a total of 5,677,383 participants (all women) were included in the review. These studies were all based in the US. Because all of these non‐experimental studies had considerable systematic errors in the way they conducted their analysis, we judged this body of evidence to have very low overall quality. This review found weak evidence that in‐work tax credit for families interventions had no effect on health status, except for mixed evidence for tobacco use in adult women, where some studies suggested that rates of smoking reduced.",CD009963
"Background Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases, and may be linked to improved nutrition outcomes in children. Objectives To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. Search methods We searched 10 English‐language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese‐language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. Selection criteria Randomised (including cluster‐randomised), quasi‐randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross‐sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study‐level and individual‐level meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. Main results Fourteen studies (five cluster‐randomised controlled trials and nine non‐randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low‐ and middle‐income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age or height‐for‐age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants. Weight‐for‐age, weight‐for‐height and height‐for‐age z‐scores were available for five cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.12). Meta‐analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐height z‐score (MD 0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11). Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster‐randomised controlled trials. No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster‐randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. Authors' conclusions The available evidence from meta‐analysis of data from cluster‐randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9‐12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low‐income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.","The effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply, provide sanitation and promote handwashing with soap on physical growth in children In low‐income countries an estimated 165 million children under the age of five years suffer from chronic undernutrition causing them to be short in height and 52 million children suffer from acute undernutrition causing them to be very thin. Poor growth in early life increases the risks of illness and death in childhood. The two immediate causes of childhood undernutrition are inadequate dietary intake and infectious diseases such as diarrhoea. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases; this review evaluates the effect that WASH interventions may have on nutrition outcomes in children. The review includes evidence from randomised and non‐randomised interventions designed to (i) improve the microbiological quality of drinking water or protect the microbiological quality of water prior to consumption; (ii) introduce new or improved water supply or improve distribution; (iii) introduce or expand the coverage and use of facilities designed to improve sanitation; or (iv) promote handwashing with soap after defecation and disposal of child faeces, and prior to preparing and handling food, or a combination of these interventions, in children aged under 18 years. We identified 14 studies of such interventions involving 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children. Meta‐analyses of the evidence from the cluster‐randomised trials suggests that WASH interventions confer a small benefit on growth in children under five years of age. While potentially important, this conclusion is based on relatively short‐term studies, none of which is of high methodological quality, and should therefore be treated with caution. There are several large, robust studies underway in low‐income country settings that should provide evidence to inform these findings.",CD009382
"Background The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has long been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia. Physicians commonly prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle. Objectives To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed the risk of bias for included studies and extracted data. Main results This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined long‐term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen. Authors' conclusions There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short‐term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well‐designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long‐term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available.","Additional oxygen in the treatment of cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from breathing problems. Giving additional oxygen has long been a standard of care for people with chronic lung diseases. It is common for doctors to prescribe this treatment for people with CF when there is not enough oxygen in their blood. We looked for evidence that this treatment improves the length and quality of life for people with CF. We found eleven studies with 172 participants to include in the review. All studies compared low‐flow oxygen to room air. Ten of the studies were short‐term. Four of the studies looked at giving additional oxygen at night. At night, oxygen levels rose during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non‐REM sleep in those people breathing low‐flow oxygen. Participants breathing oxygen at night also spent less time in REM sleep and took less time to fall asleep. Six of the studies looked at the effect of extra oxygen on exercise. The levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of participants increased during or after exercise when they breathed in low‐flow oxygen. People were able to exercise for longer if they breathed in low‐flow oxygen. There was more regular attendance at school or work in those receiving long‐term oxygen. There is little evidence to support or oppose the long‐term use of oxygen therapy in people with advanced CF lung disease. In the short term, treatment has shown some improvement in blood oxygen levels in people with CF during sleep and exercise. This increase in oxygen also came with an increase in carbon dioxide levels, which is probably not clinically important. However, caution needs to be exercised in those with advanced lung disease where this may require further monitoring. There should be research into the effects of long‐term oxygen treatment on sleep quality and exercise in people with CF. Unfortunately, we do not expect that any such research will be undertaken any time soon, so we do not plan to update this review again until we find any new trials.",CD003884
"Background Although the use of enemas during labour usually reflects the preference of the attending healthcare provider, enemas may cause discomfort for women. Objectives To assess the effects of enemas applied during the first stage of labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 5), PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2013), LILACS (31 May 2013), the Search Portal of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 May 2013), Health Technology Assessment Program, UK (31 May 2013), Medical Research Council, UK (31 May 2013), The Wellcome Trust, UK (31 May 2013) and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which an enema was administered during the first stage of labour and which included assessment of possible neonatal or puerperal morbidity or mortality. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion.  Main results Four RCTs (1917 women) met the inclusion criteria. One study was judged as having a low risk of bias. In the meta‐analysis we conducted of two trials, we found no significant difference in infection rates for puerperal women (two RCTs; 594 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence (CI) 0.42 to 1.04). No significant differences were found in neonatal umbilical infection rates (two RCTs; 592 women; RR 3.16, 95% CI 0.50 to 19.82; I² 0%. In addition, meta‐analysis of two studies found that there were no significant differences in the degree of perineal tear between groups. Finally, meta‐analysis of two trials found no significant differences in the mean duration of labour. Authors' conclusions The evidence provided by the four included RCTs shows that enemas do not have a significant beneficial effect on infection rates such as perineal wound infection or other neonatal infections and women's satisfaction. These findings speak against the routine use of enemas during labour, therefore, such practice should be discouraged.","Enemas during labour Scientific research evidence does not support the routine use of enemas during the first stage of labour. Giving women enemas during labour has been routine practice in delivery wards of many countries and settings. Occasionally women leak from their back passage whilst giving birth and it was thought an enema in early labour would reduce this soiling and the consequent embarrassment for women. It was also thought that emptying the back passage would give more room for the baby to be born, would reduce the length of labour and would reduce the chance of infection for both the mother and the baby. It was also suggested it would reduce bowel movements after birth which often cause women concern. The disadvantages suggested were that it is a very unpleasant procedure and causes increased pain for women during labour and because enemas could produce a watery faecal soiling whilst giving birth, they could potentially increase the risk of infections. The review identified four studies involving 1917 women. These studies found no significant differences in any of the outcomes assessed either for the woman or the baby. However, none of the trials assessed pain for the woman during labour and there were insufficient data to assess rare adverse outcomes. Thus the evidence speaks against the routine use of enemas during labour.",CD000330
"Background Antipsychotic medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and is generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling positive symptoms. However, long‐term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra‐pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia and death. Intermittent drug techniques refers to the 'use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation rather than continuously'. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by 'reducing long‐term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse', with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic‐induced side effects Objectives To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalisation. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. For non‐skewed continuous endpoint data extracted from valid scales, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups with a 95% CI. Where data displayed heterogeneity, these were analysed using a random‐effects model. Skewed data are presented in tables. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Of 241 records retrieved by the search, 17 trials conducted between 1961 and 2011, involving 2252 participants with follow‐up from six weeks to two years, were included. Homogenous data demonstrated that instances of relapse were significantly higher in people receiving any intermittent drug treatment in the long term (n = 436, 7 RCTs, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54,  moderate quality evidence ). Intermittent treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo, however, and demonstrated that significantly less people receiving intermittent antipsychotics experienced full relapse by medium term (n = 290, 2 RCTs, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58,  very low quality evidence ). Hospitalisation rates were higher for people receiving any intermittent drug treatment by long term (n = 626, 5 RCTs, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06,  moderate quality evidence ). Results demonstrated little difference in instances of tardive dyskinesia in groups with any intermittent drug technique versus maintenance therapy, with equivocal results (displaying slight heterogeneity) at long term (n = 165, 4 RCTs, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.30,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Results of this review support the existing evidence that intermittent antipsychotic treatment is not as effective as continuous, maintained antipsychotic therapy in preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment regarding adverse effects typically associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment, as well as any cost‐effectiveness of this experimental treatment.","Intermittent drug techniques for schizophrenia Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment for schizophrenia and helps people cope with positive symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, long‐term exposure to these drugs has been associated with serious side effects, such as: weight gain; uncontrollable shaking of the head, body or hands; tremors; muscle stiffness; difficulties with walking and balance; sleepiness or apathy; and even death. Some people stop taking their medication as these side effects limit people’s quality of life. Not taking medication can be a contributory factor that leads to relapse and hospitalisation. Against this backdrop, there is cause to consider the role of intermittently administering antipsychotic medication compared to the continuous use of antipsychotic medication. Intermittent drug techniques refer to the use of medication only during periods close to relapse of symptoms rather than continuously taking antipsychotic drugs all the time. Intermittent drug techniques include: prodrome‐based intervention (which assesses the risk or early stage of relapse); crisis intervention during an acute episode or downturn in mental health; gradually increased drug‐free periods; and drug holidays. The aim is to reduce exposure to drugs and decrease side effects. This review assesses different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Seventeen studies with 2252 participants compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance on medication. Relapse was significantly higher in people receiving intermittent drug treatment. Hospitalisation was higher for people receiving intermittent drug treatment. Results suggest that intermittent treatment is not as effective as continuous or maintained treatment in preventing relapse. Although information favours maintenance and continuous treatment, this is not always the case in real settings, where people may stop their medication due to debilitating side effects that affect their quality of life. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment, particularly regarding the side effects commonly associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment. There was no exploration of economic/money savings, specifically relating to the potential cost‐effectiveness of intermittent techniques. Until further evidence is available concerning the potential benefits or harms of intermittent treatment, managers, psychiatrists and policy makers should consider it an experimental therapy.

"Background A major cause of failure to achieve spontaneous vaginal birth is delay in labour due to presumed inefficient uterine action. Oxytocin is given to increase contractions and high‐dose regimens may potentially increase the number of spontaneous vaginal births, but as oxytocin can cause hyperstimulation of the uterus, there is a possibility of increased adverse events. Objectives To compare starting dose and increment dose of oxytocin for augmentation for women delayed in labour to determine whether augmentation by high‐dose regimens of oxytocin improves labour outcomes and to examine the effect on both maternal/neonatal outcomes and women's birth experiences. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials for women in delayed labour requiring augmentation by oxytocin comparing high‐dose regimens (defined as starting dose and increment of equal to or more than 4 mU per minute) with low‐dose regimens (defined as starting dose and an increment of less than 4 mU per minute). Increase interval: between 15 and 40 minutes. The separation of low‐ and high‐dose regimens is based on an arbitrary decision. Data collection and analysis Four review authors undertook assessment of trial eligibility, risk of bias, and data extraction independently. Main results We included four studies involving 644 pregnant women. Three studies were randomised controlled trials and one trial was a quasi‐randomised study. A higher dose of oxytocin was associated with a significant reduction in length of labour reported from one trial (mean difference (MD) ‐3.50 hours; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.38 to ‐0.62; one trial, 40 women). There was a decrease in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.62; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86 four trials, 644 women) and an increase in the rate of spontaneous vaginal birth in the high‐dose group (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.62, three trials, 444 women), although for both of these outcomes there were inconsistencies between studies in the size of effect. When we carried out sensitivity analysis (temporarily removing a study at high risk of bias) the differences between groups were no longer statistically significant There were no significant differences between high‐ and low‐dose regimens for instrumental vaginal birth, epidural analgesia, hyperstimulation, postpartum haemorrhage, chorioamnionitis or women's perceptions of experiences. For neonatal outcomes, there was no significant difference between groups for Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, admission to special care baby unit, or neonatal mortality. The following outcomes were not evaluated in the included studies: perinatal mortality, uterine rupture, abnormal cardiotocography, women's pyrexia, dystocia and neonatal neurological morbidity. Authors' conclusions Higher‐dose regimens of oxytocin (4 mU per minute or more) were associated with a reduction in the length of labour and in caesarean section, and an increase in spontaneous vaginal birth. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that high‐dose regimens are advised routinely for women with delay in the first stage of labour. Further research should evaluate the effect of high‐dose regimens of oxytocin for women delayed in labour and should include maternal and neonatal outcomes as well as the effects on women.","Oxytocin in high versus low doses for augmentation of delayed labour Women have different lengths of labour, with first labours lasting on average eight hours (and unlikely to last more than 18 hours) and second and subsequent labours lasting an average of five hours and unlikely to last more than 12 hours. Assessment of progress in labour takes into account not just cervical dilatation, but also descent and rotation of the fetal head and the strength, duration and frequency of contractions. Some evidence suggests that up to one‐third of women in their first labour experience delay. They are often given a synthetic version of the hormone oxytocin  to increase uterine contractions and shorten labour. Surprisingly for such a routine treatment, the ideal dose at which it should be given is not known, although some comparisons suggest that higher‐dose regimens of oxytocin could shorten labour and reduce the chance of caesarean section with an increase in the numbers of women having a spontaneous vaginal birth compared with lower‐dose regimens. However, there are potentially harmful side effects as oxytocin may cause the uterus to contract too quickly, and the baby to become distressed. Clinicians attempt to mitigate these side effects by adjusting the dose of oxytocin with the contractions to reduce the chances of the baby being distressed in labour. From the four randomised controlled trials involving 644 pregnant women that we included in this review, results indicate that a higher dose of oxytocin (4‐7 mU per minute, compared with 1‐2 mU per minute) reduced the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections with increased spontaneous vaginal births, but the studies did not provide enough evidence on possible differences between the high‐ and low‐dose regimens on adverse events including hyperstimulation of the uterus, and outcomes for the newborn infant. Only one trial reported on the possible effect on women. The overall quality of the included trials was mixed, but this might reflect how clinical trials were reported in the past.   While the current evidence is promising and suggests that the high‐dose regimens reduce the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections, this evidence is not strong enough to recommend that high‐dose regimens are used routinely for women delayed in labour. We recommend that further research is carried out.",CD007201
"Background Achieving informed consent is a core clinical procedure and is required before any surgical or invasive procedure is undertaken.  However, it is a complex process which requires patients be provided with information which they can understand and retain, opportunity to consider their options, and to be able to express their opinions and ask questions.  There is evidence that at present some patients undergo procedures without informed consent being achieved. Objectives To assess the effects on patients, clinicians and the healthcare system of interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare treatments and procedures. Search methods We searched the following databases using keywords and medical subject headings: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library,  Issue 5, 2012), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to July 2011), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to July 2011) and PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to July 2011). We applied no language or date restrictions within the search. We also searched reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised trials of interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare procedures. We considered an intervention to be intended to promote informed consent when information delivery about the procedure was enhanced (either by providing more information or through, for example, using new written materials), or if more opportunity to consider or deliberate on the information was provided. Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed the search output independently to identify potentially‐relevant studies, selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the included trials, and meta‐analyses of outcomes where there were sufficient data. Main results We included 65 randomised controlled trials from 12 countries involving patients undergoing a variety of procedures in hospitals. Nine thousand and twenty one patients were randomised and entered into these studies. Interventions used various designs and formats but the main data for results were from studies using written materials, audio‐visual materials and decision aids. Some interventions were delivered before admission to hospital for the procedure while others were delivered on admission. Only one study attempted to measure the primary outcome, which was informed consent as a unified concept, but this study was at high risk of bias.  More commonly, studies measured secondary outcomes which were individual components of informed consent such as knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with the consent process.  Important but less commonly‐measured outcomes were deliberation, decisional conflict, uptake of procedures and length of consultation. Meta‐analyses showed statistically‐significant improvements in knowledge when measured immediately after interventions (SMD 0.53 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69) I 2  73%), shortly afterwards (between 24 hours and 14 days) (SMD 0.68 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.93) I 2  85%) and at a later date (15 days or more) (SMD 0.78 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.06) I 2  82%). Satisfaction with decision making was also increased (SMD 2.25 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.15) I 2  99%) and decisional conflict was reduced (SMD ‐1.80 (95% CI ‐3.46 to ‐0.14) I 2  99%). No statistically‐significant differences were found for generalised anxiety (SMD ‐0.11 (95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.13) I 2  82%), anxiety with the consent process (SMD 0.01 (95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.23) I 2  70%) and satisfaction with the consent process (SMD 0.12 (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.32) I 2  76%). Consultation length was increased in those studies with continuous data (mean increase 1.66 minutes (95% CI 0.82 to 2.50) I 2  0%) and in the one study with non‐parametric data (control 8.0 minutes versus intervention 11.9 minutes, interquartile range (IQR) of 4 to 11.9 and 7.2 to 15.0 respectively). There were limited data for other outcomes. In general, sensitivity analyses removing studies at high risk of bias made little difference to the overall results.  Authors' conclusions Informed consent is an important ethical and practical part of patient care.  We have identified efforts by researchers to investigate interventions which seek to improve information delivery and consideration of information to enhance informed consent.  The interventions used consistently improve patient knowledge, an important prerequisite for informed consent.  This is encouraging and these measures could be widely employed although we are not able to say with confidence which types of interventions are preferable. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the high levels of heterogeneity associated with many of the main analyses although we believe there is broad evidence of beneficial outcomes for patients with the pragmatic application of interventions. Only one study attempted to measure informed consent as a unified concept.","Interventions to promote informed consent for patients undergoing surgical and other invasive healthcare procedures Before patients have an operation or other invasive procedure (e.g. endoscopy) it is crucial for the healthcare professional to explain what the treatment involves, what alternatives exist and the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.  This process is known as ‘informed consent’ and aims to provide sufficient information to allow patients to understand their treatment options and to choose between them.  Research suggests that when informed consent is obtained, the information provided by healthcare professionals is often unclear or insufficient, leading to misunderstanding, a worse treatment response and even litigation.  A number of interventions have been developed to improve the quality of information provided to patients, including written pamphlets, videos and websites.  It is unclear whether these interventions work in clinical practice.  In this review we summarise studies of interventions designed to improve information delivery or to improve consideration of information for informed consent.  We searched the scientific literature to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions designed to improve informed consent in clinical practice.  We wanted to determine primarily whether these interventions improved all components of ‘informed consent’ (understanding, deliberation and communication of decision).  Other individual outcomes of direct relevance to patients (e.g. recall/knowledge, understanding, satisfaction and anxiety), those related to healthcare professionals (e.g. ease of use of intervention, satisfaction) and system outcomes (e.g. cost, rates of procedural uptake) were also assessed.  We included 65 studies involving a total of 9021 patients.  The studies varied according to the type of intervention, the procedure for which consent was sought, the clinical setting and the outcomes measured.  Most interventions were written or audio‐visual.  Only one study assessed all the elements of informed consent, but the design was not robust; all other studies assessed only components of informed consent.  When the results of multiple studies were combined, we found that interventions improved knowledge of the planned procedure, immediately (up to 24 hours), in the short term (1 to 14 days) and the long term (more than 14 days).  Satisfaction with decision making was increased; decisional conflict was reduced; and consultation length may be increased. There were no differences between the intervention and control for the outcomes of generalised anxiety, and either anxiety or satisfaction associated with the consent process. Limitations of the review include difficulties combining the results of studies due to variation in the procedures undergone by patients, the interventions used and outcomes measured.  This means that we are uncertain as to which specific interventions are most effective but pragmatic steps to improve information delivery and consideration of the information are likely to benefit patients.",CD009445
"Background Patients undergoing vascular surgery are a high‐risk population with widespread atherosclerosis, an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and often multiple co‐morbidities. Postoperative cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarct (MI), are common. Statins are the medical treatment of choice to reduce high cholesterol levels. Evidence is accumulating that patients taking statins at the time of surgery are protected against a range of perioperative complications, but the specific benefits for patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery are not clear. Objectives We examined whether short‐term statin therapy, commenced before or on the day of noncardiac vascular surgery and continuing for at least 48 hours afterwards, improves patient outcomes including the risk of complications, pain, quality of life and length of hospital stay .  We also examined whether the effect of statin therapy on these outcomes changes depending on the dose of statin received. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to August 2012), EMBASE via Ovid SP (1966 to August 2012), CINAHL via EBSCO host (1966 to August 2012) and ISI Web of Science (1946 to July 2012) without any language restriction. We used a combination of free text search and controlled vocabulary search. The results were limited to randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). We conducted forwards and backwards citation of key articles and searched two clinical trial Websites for ongoing trials ( www.clinicaltrials.gov   and  http://www.controlled‐trials.com ). Selection criteria We included RCTs that had compared short‐term statin therapy, either commenced de novo or with existing users randomly assigned to different dosages, in adult participants undergoing elective and emergency noncardiac arterial surgery, including both open and endovascular procedures. We defined  short‐term  as commencing before or on the day of surgery and continuing for at least 48 hours afterwards . Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. We performed separate analyses for the comparisons of statin with placebo/no treatment and between different doses of statin. We presented results as pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on random‐effects models (inverse variance method). We employed the Chi 2  test and calculated the I 2  statistic to investigate study heterogeneity. Main results We identified six eligible studies in total. The six Included studies were generally of high quality, but the largest eligible study was excluded because of concerns about its validity. Study populations were statin naive, which led to a considerable loss of eligible participants. Five RCTs compared statin use with placebo or standard care. We pooled results from three studies, with a total of 178 participants, for mortality and non‐fatal event outcomes. In the statin group, 7/105 (6.7%) participants died within 30 days of surgery, as did 10/73 (13.7%) participants in the control group. Only one death in each group was from cardiovascular causes, with an incidence of 0.95% in statin participants and 1.4% in control participants, respectively. All deaths occurred in a single study population, and so effect estimates were derived from one study only. The risk ratio (RR) of all‐cause mortality in statin users showed a non‐significant decrease in risk (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.75). For cardiovascular death, the risk ratio was 1.05 (95% CI 0.07 to 16.20). Non‐fatal MI within 30 days of surgery was reported in three studies and occurred in 4/105 (3.8%) participants in the statin group and 8/73 (11.0%) participants receiving placebo, for a non‐significant decrease in risk (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.52). Several studies reported muscle enzyme levels as safety measures, but only three (with a total of 188 participants) reported explicitly on clinical muscle syndromes, with seven events reported and no significant difference found between statin users and controls (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.63). The only participant‐reported outcome was nausea in one small study,with no significant difference in risk between groups. Two studies compared different doses of atorvastatin, with a total of 145 participants, but reported data were not sufficient to allow us to determine the effect of higher doses on any outcome. Authors' conclusions Evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to conclude that statin use resulted in either a reduction or an increase in any of the outcomes examined. The existing body of evidence leaves questions about the benefits of perioperative use of statins for vascular surgery unanswered. Widespread use of statins in the target population means that it may now be difficult for researchers to undertake the large RCTs needed to demonstrate any effect on the incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events. However, participant‐reported outcomes have been neglected and warrant further study.","Perioperative statin use to improve outcomes during and after noncardiac vascular surgery Patients undergoing vascular surgery often have widespread atherosclerosis and are at high risk of complications during and after the operation. (Atherosclerosis is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of an accumulation of fatty deposits such as cholesterol.) Statins are widely used to treat raised cholesterol levels but also confer beneficial effects on the inflammatory and circulatory systems. Their long‐term use in patients with vascular disease is well established. Accumulating evidence suggests that short‐term treatment with statins may reduce complications after cardiac surgery, but it is not yet clear whether there are any benefits for vascular surgery patients.    In July 2012 we searched medical databases for controlled trials of participants who had undergone aortic or arterial surgery and were randomly assigned to either statins or placebo (or standard care). Many vascular surgery patients are already taking statins; therefore we also included trials that randomly assigned participants to different doses of statin. Statin treatment should have been started any time between the decision to operate and performance of the operation and continued for at least 48 hours after the operation. We wanted to investigate the effect of this short‐term statin therapy on the risk of death and cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke within 30 days of surgery. We also considered adverse effects of statins such as muscle pain. We found five studies that compared participants receiving statins with a control treatment or with placebo, but only three of these reported outcomes could be combined in the meta‐analyses. These three studies were of high quality but studied only 178 participants in total. This means that evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether statins improved patient outcomes after surgery. We were also not able to establish whether any adverse effects such as muscle pain were associated with statin use. We found that two studies had compared different doses of atorvastatin, but evidence was insufficient to determine whether any benefits or risks were associated with using a higher dose.   Given the limited quantity of data obtained from randomized controlled trials, further studies are required to allow investigators to gather better information about whether prescribing statins around the time of vascular surgery can improve outcomes. However, widespread use of statins in patients before they need surgery may make these studies impracticable.",CD009971
"Background The risk of developing a tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC)‐related infection ranges between 0.1 and 2.3 per 1000 catheter days for children with cancer. These infections are difficult to treat with systemic antibiotics (salvage rate 24% ‐ 66%) due to biofilm formation in the CVC. Lock treatments can achieve 100 ‐ 1000 times higher concentrations locally without exposure to high systemic concentrations. Objectives Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of antibiotic and other lock treatments in the treatment of CVC‐related infections in children with cancer compared to a control intervention. We also assessed adverse events of lock treatments. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , issue 3, 2011), MEDLINE/PubMed (1945 to August 2011) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to August 2011). In addition we searched reference lists from relevant articles and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2006 to 2010), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2006 to 2010), the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) (from 2006 to 2011), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) (from 2006 to 2010) and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haematology (ISTH) (from 2006 to 2011). We scanned the ISRCTN Register and the National Institute of Health Register for ongoing trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) (August 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing an antibiotic lock or other lock treatment (with or without concomitant systemic antibiotics) with a control intervention (other lock treatment with or without concomitant systemic antibiotics or systemic antibiotics alone) for the treatment of CVC‐related infections in children with cancer. For the description of adverse events, cohort studies were also eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments of included studies. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Main results Two RCTs evaluated urokinase lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotics (n = 56) versus systemic antibiotics alone (n = 48), and one CCT evaluated ethanol lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotics (n = 15) versus systemic antibiotics alone (n = 13). No RCTs or CCTs evaluating antibiotic lock treatments were identified. All studies had methodological limitations and clinical heterogeneity between studies was present. We found no evidence of significant difference between ethanol or urokinase lock treatments with concomitant systemic antibiotics and systemic antibiotics alone regarding the number of participants cured, the number of recurrent CVC‐related infections, the number of days until the first negative blood culture, the number of CVCs prematurely removed, ICU admission and sepsis. Not all studies were included in all analyses. No adverse events occurred in the five publications of cohort studies (one cohort was included in two publications) assessing this outcome; CVC malfunctioning occurred in three out of five publications of cohort studies assessing this outcome. Authors' conclusions No significant effect of urokinase or ethanol lock in addition to systemic antibiotics was found. However, this could be due to low power or a too‐short follow‐up. The cohort studies identified no adverse events; some cohort studies reported CVC malfunctioning. No RCTs or CCTs were published on antibiotic lock treatment alone. More well‐designed RCTs are needed to further explore the effect of antibiotic or other lock treatments in the treatment of CVC‐related infections in children with cancer.","Catheter lock treatments for catheter‐related infections in children with cancer Oncology patients require frequent venous access for their cancer treatment. Therefore, more permanent catheters (central venous catheters (CVCs)) are often inserted. However, these can become infected and once the CVC becomes occupied by bacteria it is difficult to eradicate these micro‐organisms. Lock solutions are medicines that are placed in the CVC and left to dwell for a certain time period. These locks only treat the CVC and high concentrations can be achieved. In this review we investigated the effect of lock treatments on CVC‐related infections. We identified three studies: two investigating the effect of urokinase lock treatments in addition to antibiotics and one study investigating the effect of ethanol locks in addition to antibiotics. We could detect no effect of urokinase or ethanol locks. However, the groups were very small. A similar study with a larger participant population might have different results.",CD008975
"Background Educational and skills‐based interventions are often used to prevent relationship and dating violence among young people. Objectives To assess the efficacy of educational and skills‐based interventions designed to prevent relationship and dating violence in adolescents and young adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, six other databases and a trials register on 7 May 2012. We handsearched the references lists of key articles and two journals ( Journal of Interpersonal Violence  and  Child Abuse and Neglect ). We also contacted researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomised, cluster‐randomised and quasi‐randomised studies comparing an educational or skills‐based intervention to prevent relationship or dating violence among adolescents and young adults with a control. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias. For each study included in the meta‐analysis, data were extracted independently by GF and one other review author (either CH, JN, SH or DS). We conducted meta‐analyses for the following outcomes: episodes of relationship violence, behaviours, attitudes, knowledge and skills. Main results We included 38 studies (15,903 participants) in this review, 18 of which were cluster‐randomised trials (11,995 participants) and two were quasi‐randomised trials (399 participants). We included 33 studies in the meta‐analyses. We included eight studies (3405 participants) in the meta‐analysis assessing episodes of relationship violence. There was substantial heterogeneity (I 2  = 57%) for this outcome. The risk ratio was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.13). We included 22 studies (5256 participants) in the meta‐analysis assessing attitudes towards relationship violence. The standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.06 (95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.15). We included four studies (887 participants) in the meta‐analysis assessing behaviour related to relationship violence; the SMD was ‐0.07 (95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.16). We included 10 studies (6206 participants) in the meta‐analysis assessing knowledge related to relationship violence; the results showed an increase in knowledge in favour of the intervention (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60) but there was substantial heterogeneity (I 2  = 52%). We included seven studies (1369 participants) in the meta‐analysis assessing skills related to relationship violence. The SMD was 0.03 (95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.17). None of the included studies assessed physical health, psychosocial health or adverse outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant differences by intervention setting or type of participants. The quality of evidence for all outcomes included in our meta‐analysis was moderate due to an unclear risk of selection and detection bias and a high risk of performance bias in most studies. Authors' conclusions Studies included in this review showed no evidence of effectiveness of interventions on episodes of relationship violence or on attitudes, behaviours and skills related to relationship violence. We found a small increase in knowledge but there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity among studies. Further studies with longer‐term follow‐up are required, and study authors should use standardised and validated measurement instruments to maximise comparability of results.","Interventions to prevent relationship and dating violence in adolescents and young people Relationship and dating violence is a significant problem among adolescents and young adults. Relationship violence includes a range of violent behaviours, from verbal abuse to physical and sexual assault, and from threats to rape and murder. Currently there are many programmes in schools and universities and within community settings that aim to prevent relationship violence. It is important to establish whether these programmes work and whether they result in long‐term reductions in relationship violence. This review looked at the results of 38 studies. The results showed no convincing evidence that the programmes decreased relationship violence, or that they improved participants' attitudes, behaviours and skills related to relationship violence. The results showed that participants' knowledge about relationships improved slightly following the programmes. These results should be interpreted with caution, as individual studies differed in the types of participants and interventions that they used and the ways in which changes were measured. None of the studies looked at the effect of the programmes on physical and mental health. Further studies, which follow participants for a longer period of time and which look at the relationship between attitudes, knowledge, behaviour, skills and the number of times relationship violence occurs, are required to improve our understanding of how well these programmes work.",CD004534
"Background Specialist paediatric home‐based nursing services have been proposed as a cost‐effective means of reducing distress resulting from hospital admissions, while enhancing primary care and reducing length of hospital stay. This review is an update of our original review, which was published in 2006. Objectives To evaluate specialist home‐based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses. Search methods We searched the following databases in February 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  2012 Issue 2, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children from birth to age 18 years with acute or chronic illnesses allocated to specialist home‐based nursing services compared with conventional health care. Outcomes included utilisation of health care, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data from the studies independently and resolved any discrepancies by recourse to a third author. Meta‐analysis was not appropriate because of the clinical diversity of the studies and the lack of common outcome measures. Main results We screened 4226 titles to yield seven RCTs with a total of 840 participants. Participants, interventions and outcomes were diverse. No significant differences were reported in health outcomes; two studies reported a reduction in the hospital stay with no difference in the hospital readmission rates. Three studies reported a reduction in parental anxiety and improvement in child behaviours was reported in three studies. Overall increased parental satisfaction was reported in three studies. Also, better parental coping and family functioning was reported in one study. By contrast, one study each reported no impact on parental burden of care or on functional status of children. Home care was reported as more costly for service providers with substantial cost savings for the family in two studies, while one study revealed no significant cost benefits for the family. Authors' conclusions Current research does not provide supporting evidence for a reduction in access to hospital services or a reduction in hospital readmission rate for children with acute and chronic illnesses using specialist home‐based nursing services; however, the only summary finding across a few studies was that there is a significant decrease in length of hospitalisation. The preliminary results show no adverse impact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers reported improved satisfaction with home‐based care. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service utilisation and long‐term costs.","Specialist home‐based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses This review aimed to examine whether specialist paediatric home‐based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses reduce the number of hospital admissions and length of stay, enhance health care in the community and reduce stress for families at the time of their child's illness. It is an update of our original review published in 2006. We found seven relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of total of 840 children aged from birth to 18 years with acute and/or chronic illnesses receiving either specialist home‐based nursing services or conventional health care. The outcomes included use of health care services, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. We decided not to combine the results of these RCTs because of the variety in types of services provided, types of participants and the outcome measures used. The results of individual RCTs show improved satisfaction with home‐based care with no adverse impact on physical health outcomes for children. There is some evidence that specialist home‐based nursing services reduce the length of hospital stay; however, there is no evidence that it leads to a reduction in use of hospital services. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service use and long‐term costs.",CD004383
"Background The reinforcing properties of nicotine may be mediated through release of various neurotransmitters both centrally and systemically. People who smoke report positive effects such as pleasure, arousal, and relaxation as well as relief of negative affect, tension, and anxiety. Opioid (narcotic) antagonists are of particular interest to investigators as potential agents to attenuate the rewarding effects of cigarette smoking. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of opioid antagonists in promoting long‐term smoking cessation. The drugs include naloxone and the longer‐acting opioid antagonist naltrexone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for trials of naloxone, naltrexone and other opioid antagonists and conducted an additional search of MEDLINE using 'Narcotic antagonists' and smoking terms in April 2013. We also contacted investigators, when possible, for information on unpublished studies. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials comparing opioid antagonists to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation. We included in the meta‐analysis only those trials which reported data on abstinence for a minimum of six months. We also reviewed, for descriptive purposes, results from short‐term laboratory‐based studies of opioid antagonists designed to evaluate psycho‐biological mediating variables associated with nicotine dependence. Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate on the study population, the nature of the drug therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow‐up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow‐up in patients smoking at baseline. Abstinence at end of treatment was a secondary outcome. We extracted cotinine‐ or carbon monoxide‐verified abstinence where available. Where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis, pooling risk ratios using a Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect model. Main results Eight trials of naltrexone met inclusion criteria for meta‐analysis of long‐term cessation. One trial used a factorial design so five trials compared naltrexone versus placebo and four trials compared naltrexone plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo plus NRT. Results from 250 participants in one long‐term trial remain unpublished. No significant difference was detected between naltrexone and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.51, 445 participants), or between naltrexone and placebo as an adjunct to NRT (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30, 768 participants). The estimate was similar when all eight trials were pooled (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24, 1213 participants). In a secondary analysis of abstinence at end of treatment, there was also no evidence of any early treatment effect, (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.22, 1213 participants). No trials of naloxone or buprenorphine reported abstinence outcomes. Authors' conclusions Based on data from eight trials and over 1200 individuals, there was no evidence of an effect of naltrexone alone or as an adjunct to NRT on long‐term smoking abstinence, with a point estimate strongly suggesting no effect and confidence intervals that make a clinically important effect of treatment unlikely. Although further trials might narrow the confidence intervals they are unlikely to be a good use of resources.","Do opioid antagonists such as naltrexone help people to stop smoking? Opioid antagonists are a type of drug which blunts the effects of narcotics such as heroin and morphine, and might help reduce nicotine addiction by blocking some of the rewarding effects of smoking. Our review identified eight trials of naltrexone, a long‐acting opioid antagonist. The trials included over 1200 smokers. Half the trials gave everyone nicotine replacement therapy and tested whether naltrexone had any additional benefit. Compared to a placebo, naltrexone did not increase the proportion of people who had stopped smoking, at the end of treatment, or at six months or more after treatment, either on its own or added to NRT. The available evidence does not suggest that opioid antagonists such as naltrexone assist smoking cessation.",CD003086
"Background Spasticity may affect stroke survivors by contributing to activity limitations, caregiver burden, pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). Spasticity management guidelines recommend multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation programmes following botulinum toxin (BoNT) treatment for post‐stroke spasticity. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of MD rehabilitation is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of MD rehabilitation, following BoNT and other focal intramuscular treatments such as phenol, in improving activity limitations and other outcomes in adults and children with post‐stroke spasticity. To explore what settings, types and intensities of rehabilitation programmes are effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1948 to December 2011), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), CINAHL (1982 to January 2012), AMED (1985 to January 2012), LILACS (1982 to September 2012), PEDro, REHABDATA and OpenGrey (September 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registries and reference lists, handsearched journals and contacted authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared MD rehabilitation (delivered by two or more disciplines in conjunction with medical input) following BoNT and other focal intramuscular treatments for post‐stroke spasticity with placebo, routinely available local services, or lower levels of intervention; or studies that compared MD rehabilitation in different settings, of different types, or at different levels of intensity. We excluded RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of unidisciplinary therapy (for example physiotherapy only) or a single modality (for example stretching, casting, electrical stimulation or splinting only). The primary outcomes were validated measures of activity level (active and passive function) according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Secondary outcomes included measures of symptoms, impairments, participation, QoL, impact on caregivers and adverse events. Data collection and analysis We independently selected the trials, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Due to the limited number of included studies, with clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity, quantitative meta‐analysis was not possible. Therefore, GRADE provided qualitative synthesis of 'best evidence'. Main results We included three RCTs involving 91 participants. All three studies scored 'low quality' on the methodological quality assessment, implying high risk of bias. All studies investigated various types and intensities of outpatient rehabilitation programmes following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in adults with chronic stroke. Rehabilitation programmes included: modified constraint‐induced movement therapy (mCIMT) compared with a neurodevelopmental therapy programme; task practice therapy with cyclic functional electrical stimulation (FES) compared with task practice therapy only; and occupational, manual therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting compared with occupational therapy only. There was 'low quality' evidence for mCIMT improving upper limb motor function and spasticity in chronic stroke survivors with residual voluntary upper limb activity, up to six months, and 'very low quality' evidence for dynamic elbow splinting and occupational therapy reducing elbow range of movement at 14 weeks. Task practice therapy with cyclic FES did not improve upper limb function more than task practice therapy alone, only at 12 weeks. No studies addressed interventions in children and those with lower limb spasticity, or after other focal intramuscular treatments for spasticity. Authors' conclusions At best there was 'low level' evidence for the effectiveness of outpatient MD rehabilitation in improving active function and impairments following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in adults with chronic stroke. No trials explored the effect of MD rehabilitation on 'passive function' (caring for the affected limb), caregiver burden, or the individual's priority goals for treatment. The optimal types (modalities, therapy approaches, settings) and intensities of therapy for improving activity (active and passive function) in adults and children with post‐stroke spasticity, in the short and longer term, are unclear. Further research is required to build evidence in this area.","Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following treatment of spasticity after stroke Stroke can cause muscle stiffness, spasms or tightness in the affected arm or leg, with pain and abnormal positioning of the limb. Consequently, there may be difficulties using the arm or leg in everyday activities or in caring for the affected limb. Treatments for spasticity may include botulinum toxin and other injected medications that paralyse the affected muscles. Following such injections, a multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation programme (usually delivered by two or more health professionals) is often employed. Interventions may include stretching, splinting, gait training, repetitive practice in using the arm for tasks, and orthotic prescription. Therapies are aimed at reducing spasticity to improve limb use or positioning, or to make it easier to care for the affected limb. The outcomes of such programmes focus on attainment of functional goals that are important to affected people in their everyday life. We included three relevant studies in the review, which investigated different types of MD rehabilitation interventions after botulinum toxin injections into the arms of 91 adults with previous stroke. There was low quality evidence for intensive forced use of the affected arm in improving spasticity, and very low quality evidence for elbow splinting with occupational therapy. We did not identify any studies of MD rehabilitation in children with post‐stroke spasticity or after other injected medications. The review findings are limited by the small number of studies that are methodologically flawed. More research is needed into what rehabilitation modalities and treatments are most effective for spasticity management following stroke.",CD009689
"Background Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement is a standard treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). In‐stent restenosis after PCI remains an important clinical problem. Xiongshao capsule has been reported to be beneficial in preventing restenosis after PCI in CHD patients. However, the strength of evidence to support its use is unclear. Objectives To systematically assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Xiongshao capsule in preventing restenosis after PCI in patients with CHD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 3 of 2012), MEDLINE (OVID) (1948 to week 1 March 2012), EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to week 10 2012), ISI Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1970 to 14 March 2012), LILACS (1982 to 15 March 2012), Chinese biomedical literature database (1980 to May 2012), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994 to May 2012), Chinese Medical Current Contents (1994 to May 2012), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (1989 to May 2012), Chinese Master's Theses Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012), China Doctor Dissertation Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012), and China Proceedings of Conference Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012). We also searched ongoing trials and research registries. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing Xiongshao capsule alone/plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine alone/plus placebo in participants with CHD who met the recognised diagnostic criteria and had successfully undergone a PCI procedure were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials using The Cochrane Collaboration tool, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. Data were pooled for meta‐analysis using the fixed‐effect model, and the results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results Four trials involving 649 participants were included in this review. Two of these trials (459 participants) were designed as randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials with an adequate methodological description; the other two trials (190 participants) described an inadequate methodological design. All four trials with 649 participants were included in the meta‐analysis. Significant differences were noted in rates of restenosis, recurrence angina pectoris, and serious cardiovascular adverse events between Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine and the same conventional western medicine alone; RR values (95% CIs) were 0.41 (0.22 to 0.75), 0.47 (0.31 to 0.72), and 0.47 (0.25 to 0.90), respectively. Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine showed more significant reductions in restenosis (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80), recurrence angina pectoris (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38), and serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.70) than the same conventional western medicine plus placebo. Safety outcomes and adverse events of the Xiongshao capsule were reported in two trials, which reported no adverse events. Authors' conclusions The summary estimates indicate a protective effect of Xiongshao on restenosis and suggest that Xiongshao capsule may be used to prevent restenosis after a PCI procedure in CHD patients. However, this evidence is derived from small randomised trials, all conducted in China, and two of the included trials showed important methodological limitations that undermine the validity of the findings. Additional high‐quality research trials with sufficient sample size are required.","Xiongshao capsule preventing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary heart disease Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the world. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement is the standard nonsurgical treatment for CHD. However, its main limitation is the repeated blocking of blood vessels following a stent procedure. Data from experimental and human studies have suggested that Xiongshao capsule, a Chinese herbal medicine product, may be beneficial in preventing restenosis of blood vessels after a PCI procedure. We systematically reviewed currently available evidence with the goal of performing a reliable assessment of the effects and safety of Xiongshao in repeated blocking of blood vessels after PCI. We identified four trials that tested treatments based on Xiongshao capsule. Two trials compared Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine plus placebo; the other two trials compared Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine alone for preventing restenosis after a PCI procedure in CHD patients. These trials reported that use of Xiongshao capsule caused a significant reduction in the incidence rates of restenosis, recurrence angina pectoris, and serious cardiovascular adverse events with no substantive adverse effects following a PCI procedure. Therefore Xiongshao capsule may represent a choice for the prevention of in‐stent restenosis following a PCI procedure. However, although summary estimates indicate a protective effect of Xiongshao on restenosis, evidence is derived in part from small randomised trials, all conducted in China, with some methodological limitations that undermine the validity of the findings. Additional high‐quality research trials with sufficient sample size are required.",CD009581
"Background Explanations for the effectiveness of stroke units compared with general wards in reducing mortality, institutionalisation and dependence of people with stroke remain undetermined, and the discussion on the most effective stroke unit model is still up for debate. The intensity of non‐invasive mechanical monitoring in many western countries is one of the main issues regarding the different models. This is because of its strong impact on the organisation of the stroke unit in terms of the number of personnel, their expertise, the infrastructure and costs. Objectives To assess whether continuous intensive monitoring compared with intermittent monitoring of physiological variables in people with acute stroke can change their prognosis in terms of mortality or disability. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2012), EMBASE (1980 to November 2012), CINAHL (1982 to November 2012) and the British Nursing Index (1985 to November 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registers (November 2012) and reference lists, handsearched conference proceedings and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria We included all randomised, cluster randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing continuous monitoring with intermittent monitoring in people within three days of stroke onset. We excluded studies confounded by the delivery of care in different settings (that is studies in which the location of the intervention was not in the same ward in the two arms of the trial). Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We sought original data from trialists in two trials and verified the inclusion criteria in another four trials (three presented at conferences and one was from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry). Where possible, we extracted data on the threshold level of abnormality that triggered intervention for a given physiological variable, the specific intervention given to correct the abnormality and compliance with the allocated therapy. Main results Three studies, involving a total of 354 participants, met our inclusion criteria for the primary outcome. Compared with intermittent monitoring, continuous monitoring significantly reduced death and disability at three months or discharge (odds ratio (OR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.56) and was associated with a non‐significant reduction in deaths from any cause at discharge (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.85). These significant results depend on one study that has a high risk of bias. Continuous monitoring was associated with a non‐significant reduction of dependency (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.06), death from vascular causes (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.39), neurological complications (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.43), length of stay (mean difference (MD) ‐5.24, 95% CI ‐10.51 to 0.03) and institutionalisation (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.04 to 15.72) (secondary outcomes). For the last two outcomes we detected consistent heterogeneity across trials. Cardiac complications (OR 8.65, 95% CI 2.52 to 29.66), fever (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.84) and hypotension (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.68 to 14.38) were detected significantly more often in participants who received continuous monitoring (surrogate outcomes). We detected no significant increase in adverse events due to immobility (pneumonia, other infections or deep vein thrombosis) in participants who were continuously monitored compared with those allocated to intermittent monitoring. Authors' conclusions Continuous monitoring of physiological variables for the first two to three days may improve outcomes and prevent complications. Attention to the changes in physiological variables is a key feature of a stroke unit, and can most likely be aided by continuous monitoring without complications related to immobility or to treatments triggered by the relief of abnormal physiological variables. Well‐designed, high‐quality studies are needed because many questions remain open and deserve further research. These include when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.","Continuous or intermittent monitoring of people with acute stroke Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, breathing and heart rhythm are important physiological variables that need to be checked frequently in people with an acute stroke. This monitoring can be carried out in different ways, particularly in well‐organised stroke units. Continuous monitoring is supported by automatic equipment connected to the patient and supervised by nurses, whereas intermittent monitoring is performed by nurses using manual and portable equipment. We searched for all trials that compared continuous monitoring with intermittent monitoring in people with acute stroke. We identified three studies including a total of 354 participants. Stroke unit care with continuous monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in the chance of being dead or disabled after the stroke. Unfortunately this evidence is not entirely reliable because of the small number of participants, differences in the definitions of abnormal results, and the less reliable methods used in the largest trial. Further research is required to answer many remaining questions, such as when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.",CD008444
"Background Dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome (DB/HVS) is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply and/or too rapidly (hyperventilation) or erratic breathing interspersed with breath‐holding or sighing (DB). DB/HVS can result in significant patient morbidity and an array of symptoms including breathlessness, chest tightness, dizziness, tremor and paraesthesia. DB/HVS has an estimated prevalence of 9.5% in the general adult population, however, there is little consensus regarding the most effective management of this patient group. Objectives 1) To determine whether breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS have beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices 2) To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS Search methods We identified trials for consideration using both electronic and manual search strategies. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and four other databases. The latest search was in February 2013. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised, quasi‐randomised or cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which breathing exercises, or a combined intervention including breathing exercises as a key component, were compared with either no treatment or another therapy that did not include breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS. Observational studies, case studies and studies utilising a cross‐over design were not eligible for inclusion. We considered any type of breathing exercise for inclusion in this review, such as breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing, yoga breathing, Buteyko breathing, biofeedback‐guided breathing modification, yawn/sigh suppression. Programs where exercises were either supervised or unsupervised were eligible as were relaxation techniques and acute‐episode management, as long as it was clear that breathing exercises were a key component of the intervention. We excluded any intervention without breathing exercises or where breathing exercises were not key to the intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked search results for eligible studies, assessed all studies that appeared to meet the selection criteria and extracted data. We used standard procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included a single RCT assessed at unclear risk of bias, which compared relaxation therapy (n = 15) versus relaxation therapy and breathing exercises (n = 15) and a no therapy control group (n = 15). Quality of life was not an outcome measure in this RCT, and no numerical data or statistical analysis were presented in this paper. A significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hyperventilation attacks in the breathing exercise group compared with the control group was reported. In addition, a significant difference in frequency and severity of hyperventilation attacks between the breathing and relaxation group was reported. However, no information could be extracted from the paper regarding the size of the treatment effects. Authors' conclusions The results of this systematic review are unable to inform clinical practice, based on the inclusion of only one small, poorly reported RCT. There is no credible evidence regarding the effectiveness of breathing exercises for the clinical symptoms of DB/HVS. It is currently unknown whether these interventions offer any added value in this patient group or whether specific types of breathing exercise demonstrate superiority over others. Given that breathing exercises are frequently used to treat DB/HVS, there is an urgent need for further well designed clinical trials in this area. Future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, validated outcome measures. Trial reports should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.","Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome Background    Dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome (DB/HVS) is a breathing problem that involves breathing too deeply and/or too rapidly (hyperventilation). There are many possible causes of DB/HVS and if left untreated it can lead to a variety of unpleasant symptoms such as breathlessness, dizziness, pins and needles and chest pain. Review question    The aim of this review was to investigate whether breathing exercises are useful in the treatment of dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome. The overall aim of all breathing exercises is to teach the patient to breathe gently using the lower part of their chest, at a rate that matches their activity level. Key results    Only one study met the criteria for inclusion in this review, in which participants also received relaxation therapy. This study had a small number of participants and provided very little detail as to how it was undertaken. Although the trial report suggested that breathing exercises may be beneficial in the treatment of this particular patient group no numerical data were presented so we could not be sure. No reliable conclusions can be drawn from this small, isolated study. This Cochrane plain language summary is up to date as of February 2013.",CD009041
"Background Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects. Objectives To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit. Search methods We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012. Selection criteria We selected all double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of ≤ 7 mg weekly). Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria. Main results Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled. For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P < 0.00001). We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis / mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06) It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials. It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores). Authors' conclusions The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX. There was a clincally important significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a clincally important significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance. This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.","Folic acid or folinic acid for reducing side effects of methotrexate for people with rheumatoid arthritis Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of folic acid or folinic acid for people taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. After searching for all relevant studies, six studies with up to 624 people were included in the review. Their findings are summarized below. In people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate (MTX): ‐ Taking either folic or folinic acid probably improves some side effects of MTX such as nausea and abdominal pain ‐ Taking either folic or folinic acid probably reduces the chance of developing abnormal liver blood tests ‐ Taking either folic or folinic acid probably helps people continue on their MTX treatment ‐ Taking either folic or folinic acid may improve some side effects of MTX such as mouth sores ‐ We are unable to ascertain whether or not taking folic or folinic acid with MTX prevents neutropenia (problems with producing white blood cells) ‐ Taking folic or folinic acid with MTX probably has no effect on how well MTX is able to treat rheumatoid arthritis. What are folic acid and folinic acids and why do people take them with MTX? Folic acid and folinic acid are forms of vitamin B9. The human body needs folate to perform many functions, including cell division, growth, and the production of new red blood cells. Folinic acid is chemically different to folic acid but both work in a similar way. If a person does not have enough folic acid or folinic acid, it is called a folate deficiency. MTX (a medication that is commonly prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis) works by blocking some of the effects of folic acid. A folate deficiency may cause side effects such as mouth sores, stomach problems such as nausea or abdominal pain, liver problems or problems with producing blood cells. These side effects are sometimes bad enough that they cause people to stop taking MTX (discontinue treatment). Best estimate of what happens to people who take folic acid or folinic acid while on MTX Stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain: ‐ 9 fewer people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea up to 6 to 12 months after starting folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX (9.0% absolute improvement); ‐ 35 people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea when they took MTX alone for their rheumatoid arthritis; ‐ 26 people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea when they took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX. Liver problems (as measured by abnormal liver blood tests): ‐ 16 fewer people out of 100 had liver problems up to 6 to 12 months after they starting folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX (16.0% absolute improvement); ‐ 21 people out of 100 experienced abnormal liver blood tests when they took MTX alone for their rheumatoid arthritis; ‐ 5 people out of 100 experienced abnormal liver blood tests when they took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX. Ability to continue on MTX treatment: ‐ 15 fewer people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid dropped out of the studies for any reason (15.2% absolute improvement); ‐ 25 people out of 100 who took a placebo (fake folic acid or folinic acid) with their MTX dropped out of the studies for any reason; ‐ 10 people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX dropped out of the studies for any reason. Mouth sores or ulcers: ‐ 6 fewer people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX developed mouth sores (6.2% absolute improvement); ‐ 22 people out of 100 who took a placebo (fake folic acid) with their MTX developed mouth sores or ulcers; ‐ 16 people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX developed mouth sores or ulcers.",CD000951
"Background Despite the high incidence of muscle weakness in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND), the effects of exercise in this population are not well understood. This is an update of a review first published in 2008. Objectives To systematically review randomised and quasi‐randomised studies of exercise for people with ALS or MND. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (2 July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 6 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2012), AMED (January 1985 to June 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1938 to June 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to June 2012), Ovid HealthSTAR (January 1975 to December 2012). We also searched ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I (2007 to 2012), inspected the reference lists of all papers selected for review and contacted authors with expertise in the field. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of people with a diagnosis of definite, probable, probable with laboratory support, or possible ALS, as defined by the El Escorial criteria. We included progressive resistance or strengthening exercise, and endurance or aerobic exercise. The control condition was no exercise or standard rehabilitation management. Our primary outcome measure was improvement in functional ability, decrease in disability or reduction in rate of decline as measured by a validated outcome tool at three months. Our secondary outcome measures were improvement in psychological status or quality of life, decrease in fatigue, increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of muscle strength (strengthening or resistance studies), increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of aerobic endurance (aerobic or endurance studies) at three months and frequency of adverse effects. We did not exclude studies on the basis of measurement of outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We collected adverse event data from included trials. The review authors contacted the authors of the included studies to obtain information not available in the published articles. Main results We identified two randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria, and we found no new trials when we updated the searches in 2012. The first, a study with overall unclear risk of bias, examined the effects of a twice‐daily exercise program of moderate load endurance exercise versus ""usual activities"" in 25 people with ALS. The second, a study with overall low risk of bias, examined the effects of thrice weekly moderate load and moderate intensity resistance exercises compared to usual care (stretching exercises) in 27 people with ALS. After three months, when the results of the two trials were combined (43 participants), there was a significant mean improvement in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) measure of function in favour of the exercise groups (mean difference 3.21, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 5.96). No statistically significant differences in quality of life, fatigue or muscle strength were found. In both trials adverse effects, investigators reported no adverse effects such as increased muscle cramping, muscle soreness or fatigue Authors' conclusions The included studies were too small to determine to what extent strengthening exercises for people with ALS are beneficial, or whether exercise is harmful. There is a complete lack of randomised or quasi‐randomised clinical trials examining aerobic exercise in this population. More research is needed.","Therapeutic exercise for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease Muscle weakness is very common in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). A weak muscle can be damaged if overworked because it is already functioning close to its maximal limits. Because of this, some experts have discouraged exercise programs for people with ALS. However, if a person with ALS is not active, deconditioning (loss of muscle performance) and weakness from lack of use occurs, on top of the deconditioning and weakness caused by the disease itself. If the reduced level of activity persists, many organ systems can be affected and a person with ALS can develop further deconditioning and muscle weakness, and muscle and joint tightness may occur leading to contractures (abnormal distortion and shortening of muscles) and pain. These all make daily activities harder to do. This review found only two randomised studies of exercise in people with ALS. The trials compared an exercise program with usual care (stretching exercises). Combining the results from the two trials (43 participants), exercise produced a greater average improvement in function (measured using an ALS‐specific measurement scale) than usual care. There were no other differences between the two groups. There were no reported adverse events due to exercise. The studies were too small to determine to what extent exercise for people with ALS is beneficial or whether exercise is harmful. We found no new trials when we updated the searches in 2012. More research is needed.",CD005229
"Background It had been assumed that suppressing the undamaged contralesional motor cortex by repetitive low‐frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or increasing the excitability of the damaged hemisphere cortex by high‐frequency rTMS will promote function recovery after stroke. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS for improving function in people with stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (April 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 4), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (April 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012), EMBASE (1980 to May 2012), Science Citation Index (1981 to April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (1990 to April 2012), CINAHL (1982 to May 2012), AMED (1985 to May 2012), PEDro (April 2012), REHABDATA (April 2012) and CIRRIE Database of International Rehabilitation Research (April 2012). In addition, we searched five Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers and relevant reference lists. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing rTMS therapy with sham therapy or no therapy. We excluded trials that reported only laboratory parameters. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We included 19 trials involving a total of 588 participants in this review. Two heterogenous trials with a total of 183 participants showed that rTMS treatment was not associated with a significant increase in the Barthel Index score (mean difference (MD) 15.92, 95% CI ‐2.11 to 33.95). Four trials with a total of 73 participants were not found to have a statistically significant effect on motor function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 2.01). Subgroup analyses of different stimulation frequencies or duration of illness also showed no significant difference. Few mild adverse events were observed in the rTMS groups, with the most common events being transient or mild headaches (2.4%, 8/327) and local discomfort at the site of the stimulation. Authors' conclusions Current evidence does not support the routine use of rTMS for the treatment of stroke. Further trials with larger sample sizes are needed to determine a suitable rTMS protocol and the long‐term functional outcome.","Magnetic brain stimulation for improving people’s functional ability after stroke The human brain has two hemispheres. For people who have had a stroke, activity in the affected hemisphere is disrupted not only by the damage caused by the stroke itself, but also by the reaction of the unaffected hemisphere, which tries to limit the damage caused by the stroke. This limiting effect, while beneficial in the initial stage after stroke, may subsequently become detrimental as it interferes with the brain’s capacity to recover functional ability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a method of non‐invasive brain stimulation that can help the affected hemisphere to repair the damage of the stroke, while decreasing the limiting effect on recovery caused by undamaged hemisphere. rTMS has been investigated in the treatment of many conditions, including depression, tinnitus and movement disorders. The aim of this review was to assess randomised controlled trials of rTMS on functional recovery in patients with stroke. We included 19 trials with a total of 588 patients in the review. We found that rTMS treatment was not associated with improved activities of daily living nor had a statistically significant effect on motor function. The current evidence is not yet sufficient to support the routine use of rTMS for the treatment of stroke.",CD008862
"Background Gastric cancer is difficult to cure once it progresses to an advanced or late stage. Although some chemotherapies or bio‐therapies have made progress in the remission of this disease, the mortality from gastric cancer remains high. A variety of Chinese medicinal herbs have been used to treat gastric cancer. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicinal herbs in the short‐term remission of advanced or late gastric cancer. Search methods We searched the  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, AHMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) and CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database) from the first year of the databases to June 2011. We handsearched a number of journals. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials of Chinese herbs for advanced or late gastric cancer were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data, which were analysed using RevMan 5.1 software ( RevMan 2011 ). For dichotomous data, we estimated the relative risk. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference. Main results Eighty‐five trials with 6857 advanced or late gastric cancer patients were identified for inclusion, most were of low quality and used traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) plus chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone (65 trials). Apart from 23 trials of four different kinds of TCMHs, we could not pool the results because no more than two used the same intervention or outcomes. TCMHs with or without chemotherapy, in 57 trials, showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of mortality in nine trials, quality of life in 16 trials, rate of remission in 11 trials, and leukopenia in five trials. The pooled results from the four injected TCMHs, Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, but no significant difference in the rate of short‐term remission. Authors' conclusions This review did not provide assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxicity or side effects of chemotherapy, or reducing short‐term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng improved leukopenia when used together with chemotherapy; and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen were of benefit for adverse events in the digestive system caused by chemotherapy. These TCMHs did not improve the rate of short‐term remissions. Large, well designed clinical trials are required urgently before any definite conclusions can be drawn about the value of TCMHs for advanced or late stage gastric cancer.","Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs for induction of remission in advanced or late gastric cancer Gastric cancer, one of the malignant tumours in the gastrointestinal tract and with high morbidity among cancers, can easily lead to death once it progresses to an advanced or late stage. There are few interventions which can postpone or stop the malignant course of the illness. However, some kinds of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) have been used as an alternative therapeutic measure to treat many gastric cancer patients in China, and might be effective as an auxiliary therapy for this illness in its advanced or late stages. Our primary investigation showed there was no assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving the quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxic and side effects caused by the chemotherapy, or reducing short‐term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that four injections of the TCMHs Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen for adverse events in the digestive system, but no significant differences in the rate of short‐term remission. Most of the included studies were of low quality and valid comparisons were scarce, meaning that more trials are needed for meta‐analysis to draw definite conclusions about their benefits.",CD005096
"Background The delivery of combination contraceptive steroids from a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring offers potential advantages over the traditional oral route. The transdermal patch and vaginal ring could require a lower dose due to increased bioavailability and improved user compliance. Objectives To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, cycle control, compliance (adherence), and safety of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring versus combination oral contraceptives (COCs). Search methods Through February 2013, we searched MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP for trials of the contraceptive patch or the vaginal ring. Earlier searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we contacted known researchers and manufacturers to identify other trials. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials comparing a transdermal contraceptive patch or a contraceptive vaginal ring with a COC. Data collection and analysis Data were abstracted by two authors and entered into RevMan. For dichotomous variables, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. For continuous variables, the mean difference was computed. We also assessed the quality of evidence for this review. Main results We found 18 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Of six patch studies, five examined the marketed patch containing norelgestromin plus ethinyl estradiol (EE); one studied a patch in development that contains levonorgestrel (LNG) plus EE. Of 12 vaginal ring trials, 11 examined the same marketing ring containing etonogestrel plus EE; one studied a ring being developed that contains nesterone plus EE. Contraceptive effectiveness was not significantly different for the patch or ring versus the comparison COC. Compliance data were limited. Patch users showed better compliance than COC users in three trials. For the norelgestromin plus EE patch, ORs were 2.05 (95% CI 1.83 to 2.29) and 2.76 (95% CI 2.35 to 3.24). In the levonorgestrel plus EE patch report, patch users were less likely to have missed days of therapy (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51). Of four vaginal ring trials, one found ring users had more noncompliance (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.87 to 8.52), while another showed more compliance with the regimen (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.68). More patch users discontinued early than COC users. ORs from two meta‐analyses were 1.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.00) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.06) and another trial showed OR 2.57 (95% CI 0.99 to 6.64). Patch users also had more discontinuation due to adverse events than COC users. Users of the norelgestromin‐containing patch reported more breast discomfort, dysmenorrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In the levonorgestrel‐containing patch trial, patch users reported less vomiting, headaches, and fatigue. Of 11 ring trials with discontinuation data, two showed the ring group discontinued less than the COC group: OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.66) and OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.88). Ring users were less likely to discontinue due to adverse events in one study (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70). Compared to the COC users, ring users had more vaginitis and leukorrhea but less vaginal dryness. Ring users also reported less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional lability than COC users. For cycle control, only one trial study showed a significant difference. Women in the patch group were less likely to have breakthrough bleeding and spotting. Seven ring studies had bleeding data; four trials showed the ring group generally had better cycle control than the COC group. Authors' conclusions Effectiveness was not significantly different for the methods compared. Pregnancy data were available from half of the patch trials but two‐thirds of ring trials. The patch could lead to more discontinuation than the COC. The patch group had better compliance than the COC group. Compliance data came from half of the patch studies and one‐third of the ring trials. Patch users had more side effects than the COC group. Ring users generally had fewer adverse events than COC users but more vaginal irritation and discharge. The quality of the evidence for this review was considered low for the patch and moderate for the ring. The main reasons for downgrading were lack of information on the randomization sequence generation or allocation concealment, the outcome assessment methods, high losses to follow up, and exclusions after randomization.","Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.",CD003552
"Background Perineal trauma following vaginal birth can be associated with significant short‐term and long‐term morbidity. Antenatal perineal massage has been proposed as one method of decreasing the incidence of perineal trauma. Objectives To assess the effect of antenatal digital perineal massage on the incidence of perineal trauma at birth and subsequent morbidity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (22 October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 10), PubMed (1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating any described method of antenatal digital perineal massage undertaken for at least the last four weeks of pregnancy. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently applied the selection criteria, extracted data from the included studies and assessed study quality. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included four trials (2497 women) comparing digital perineal massage with control. All were of good quality. Antenatal digital perineal massage was associated with an overall reduction in the incidence of trauma requiring suturing (four trials, 2480 women, risk ratio (RR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 0.96), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 15 (10 to 36)) and women practicing perineal massage were less likely to have an episiotomy (four trials, 2480 women, RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.95), NNTB 21 (12 to 75)). These findings were significant for women without previous vaginal birth only. No differences were seen in the incidence of first‐ or second‐degree perineal tears or third‐/fourth‐degree perineal trauma. Only women who have previously birthed vaginally reported a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pain at three months postpartum (one trial, 376 women, RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.87) NNTB 13 (7 to 60)). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of instrumental deliveries, sexual satisfaction, or incontinence of urine, faeces or flatus for any women who practised perineal massage compared with those who did not massage. Authors' conclusions Antenatal digital perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and the reporting of ongoing perineal pain, and is generally well accepted by women. As such, women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage.","Antenatal perineal massage for reducing perineal trauma Antenatal perineal massage helps reduce both perineal trauma during birth and pain afterwards. Most women are keen to give birth without perineal tears, cuts and stitches, as these often cause pain and discomfort afterwards, and this can impact negatively on sexual functioning. Perineal massage during the last month of pregnancy has been suggested as a possible way of enabling the perineal tissue to expand more easily during birth. The review of four trials (2497 women) showed that perineal massage, undertaken by the woman or her partner (for as little as once or twice a week from 35 weeks), reduced the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and ongoing perineal pain. The impact was clear for women who had not given birth vaginally before, but was less clear for women who had. Women should be informed about the benefits of digital antenatal perineal massage.",CD005123
"Background Knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness is crucial to making an informed choice. The consumer has to comprehend the pros and cons of the contraceptive methods being considered. Choice may be influenced by understanding the likelihood of pregnancy with each method and factors that influence effectiveness. Objectives To review all randomized controlled trials comparing strategies for communicating to consumers the effectiveness of contraceptives in preventing pregnancy. Search methods Through February 2013, we searched the computerized databases of MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. Previous searches also included EMBASE. We also examined references lists of relevant articles. For the initial review, we wrote to known investigators for information about other published or unpublished trials. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials that compared methods for communicating contraceptive effectiveness to consumers. The comparison could be usual practice or an alternative to the experimental intervention. Outcome measures were knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness, attitude about contraception or toward any particular contraceptive, and choice or use of contraceptive method. Data collection and analysis For the initial review, two authors independently extracted the data. One author entered the data into RevMan, and a second author verified accuracy. For the update, an author and a research associate extracted, entered, and checked the data. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Main results Seven trials met the inclusion criteria and had a total of 4526 women. Five were multi‐site studies. Four trials were conducted in the USA, while Nigeria and Zambia were represented by one study each, and one trial was done in both Jamaica and India. Two trials provided multiple sessions for participants. In one study that examined contraceptive choice, women in the expanded program were more likely to choose sterilization (OR 4.26; 95% CI 2.46 to 7.37) or use a modern contraceptive method (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.82 to 3.03), i.e., sterilization, pills, injectable, intrauterine device or barrier method. For the other study, the groups received educational interventions with differing format and intensity. Both groups reportedly had increases in contraceptive use, but they did not differ significantly by six months in consistent use of an effective contraceptive, i.e., sterilization, IUD, injectable, implant, and consistent use of oral contraceptives, diaphragm, or male condoms. Five trials provided one session and focused on testing educational material or media. In one study, knowledge gain favored a slide‐and‐sound presentation versus a physician's oral presentation (MD ‐19.00; 95% CI ‐27.52 to ‐10.48). In another trial, a table with contraceptive effectiveness categories led to more correct answers than a table based on pregnancy numbers [ORs were 2.42 (95% CI 1.43 to 4.12) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.97)] or a table with effectiveness categories and pregnancy numbers [ORs were 2.58 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.42) and 2.03 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.64)]. Still another trial provided structured counseling with a flipchart on contraceptive methods. The intervention and usual‐care groups did not differ significantly in choice of contraceptive method (by effectiveness category) or in continuation of the chosen method at three months. Lastly, a study with couples used videos to communicate contraceptive information (control, motivational, contraceptive methods, and both motivational and methods videos). The analyses showed no significant difference between the groups in the types of contraceptives chosen. Authors' conclusions These trials varied greatly in the types of participants and interventions to communicate contraceptive effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot say overall what would help consumers choose an appropriate contraceptive method. For presenting pregnancy risk data, one trial showed that effectiveness categories were better than pregnancy numbers. In another trial, audiovisual aids worked better than the usual oral presentation. Strategies should be tested in clinical settings and measured for their effect on contraceptive choice. More detailed reporting of intervention content would help in interpreting results. Reports could also include whether the instruments used to assess knowledge or attitudes were tested for validity or reliability. Follow‐up should be incorporated to assess retention of knowledge over time. The overall quality of evidence was considered to be low for this review, given that five of the seven studies provided low or very low quality evidence.","Informing consumers about how well birth control works To make a good choice for family planning, people have to know how well different methods work. The pros and cons of the methods are important. People may choose birth control based on how well the method prevents pregnancy. Consumers also need to know what affects the usefulness of the birth control method. Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials of ways to inform people about how well family planning methods prevent pregnancy. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. The new program could be compared to the usual practice or to another program or means of informing people. We found seven trials with a total of 4526 women. Two had several sessions for participants. One of those looked at the choice of birth control method. Women in the test program more often chose to be sterilized or to use modern birth control than women with the usual counseling. In the other study, the groups had different sessions on family planning. Both groups increased their birth control use. However, the groups were similar at six months in using methods that work well to prevent pregnancy. Five trials had a single session for each group. In one, women learned more from a slide‐and‐sound format than from having a doctor talk to them. Another trial found that effectiveness categories were better than pregnancy numbers for comparing the methods. Still another study provided structured counseling using a flipchart on family planning methods. The groups were similar in choice of birth control and in numbers who still used their chosen method at three months. The last study used videos to inform couples about family planning. The groups were mostly similar in birth control use after the videos. But those who watched videos on motivation and on family planning did not choose pills or an injectable method as often as those who watched only the family planning video. The studies had different types of participants and programs. We cannot say overall what would help consumers choose their method of birth control. Ways to inform women about family planning options should be tested in clinics. Trials should look at the choice of birth control method, along with how much consumers remember later.",CD006964
"Background Impingement is a common cause of shoulder pain. Impingement mechanisms may occur subacromially (under the coraco‐acromial arch) or internally (within the shoulder joint), and a number of secondary pathologies may be associated. These include subacromial‐subdeltoid bursitis (inflammation of the subacromial portion of the bursa, the subdeltoid portion, or both), tendinopathy or tears affecting the rotator cuff or the long head of biceps tendon, and glenoid labral damage. Accurate diagnosis based on physical tests would facilitate early optimisation of the clinical management approach. Most people with shoulder pain are diagnosed and managed in the primary care setting. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of physical tests for shoulder impingements (subacromial or internal) or local lesions of bursa, rotator cuff or labrum that may accompany impingement, in people whose symptoms and/or history suggest any of these disorders. Search methods We searched electronic databases for primary studies in two stages. In the first stage, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and DARE (all from inception to November 2005). In the second stage, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED (2005 to 15 February 2010). Searches were delimited to articles written in English. Selection criteria We considered for inclusion diagnostic test accuracy studies that directly compared the accuracy of one or more physical index tests for shoulder impingement against a reference test in any clinical setting. We considered diagnostic test accuracy studies with cross‐sectional or cohort designs (retrospective or prospective), case‐control studies and randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis Two pairs of review authors independently performed study selection, assessed the study quality using QUADAS, and extracted data onto a purpose‐designed form, noting patient characteristics (including care setting), study design, index tests and reference standard, and the diagnostic 2 x 2 table. We presented information on sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the index tests. Meta‐analysis was not performed. Main results We included 33 studies involving 4002 shoulders in 3852 patients. Although 28 studies were prospective, study quality was still generally poor. Mainly reflecting the use of surgery as a reference test in most studies, all but two studies were judged as not meeting the criteria for having a representative spectrum of patients. However, even these two studies only partly recruited from primary care. The target conditions assessed in the 33 studies were grouped under five main categories: subacromial or internal impingement, rotator cuff tendinopathy or tears, long head of biceps tendinopathy or tears, glenoid labral lesions and multiple undifferentiated target conditions. The majority of studies used arthroscopic surgery as the reference standard. Eight studies utilised reference standards which were potentially applicable to primary care (local anaesthesia, one study; ultrasound, three studies) or the hospital outpatient setting (magnetic resonance imaging, four studies). One study used a variety of reference standards, some applicable to primary care or the hospital outpatient setting. In two of these studies the reference standard used was acceptable for identifying the target condition, but in six it was only partially so. The studies evaluated numerous standard, modified, or combination index tests and 14 novel index tests. There were 170 target condition/index test combinations, but only six instances of any index test being performed and interpreted similarly in two studies. Only two studies of a modified empty can test for full thickness tear of the rotator cuff, and two studies of a modified anterior slide test for type II superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, were clinically homogenous. Due to the limited number of studies, meta‐analyses were considered inappropriate. Sensitivity and specificity estimates from each study are presented on forest plots for the 170 target condition/index test combinations grouped according to target condition. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence upon which to base selection of physical tests for shoulder impingements, and local lesions of bursa, tendon or labrum that may accompany impingement, in primary care. The large body of literature revealed extreme diversity in the performance and interpretation of tests, which hinders synthesis of the evidence and/or clinical applicability.","Physical tests for shoulder impingement in primary care Impingement (or pinching) of soft‐tissues in or around the shoulder is a common cause of pain and is often linked to tissue damage in and around the joint. If doctors and therapists could identify impingement and associated damage using simple, physical tests, it would help them to inform on the best treatment approach at an early stage. We were particularly interested in the primary (community) care setting, because this is where most shoulder pain is diagnosed and managed. We reviewed original research papers for evidence on the accuracy of physical tests for shoulder impingement or associated damage, in people whose symptoms and/or history suggest any of these disorders. To find the research papers, we searched the main electronic databases of medical and allied literature up to 2010. Two review authors screened assessed the quality of each research paper and extracted important information. If multiple research papers reported using the same test for the same condition, we intended to combine their results to gain a more precise estimate of the test's accuracy. We included 33 research papers. These related to studies of 4002 shoulders in 3852 patients. None of the studies exclusively looked at patients from primary care, though two recruited some of their patients from primary care. The majority of studies used arthroscopic surgery as the reference standard. There were 170 different target condition/index test combinations but only six instances where the same test was used in the same way, and for the same reason, in two studies. For this reason combining results was not appropriate. We concluded that there is insufficient evidence upon which to base selection of physical tests for shoulder impingement, and potentially related conditions, in primary care.",CD007427
"Background Successful transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral feedings during the immediate neonatal period is associated with improved growth in preterm infants. Lactase is the last of the major intestinal disaccharidases to develop in preterm infants. Because of inadequate lactase activity, preterm infants are unable to digest lactose. Lactase preparations could potentially be used to hydrolyse lactose in formulas and breast milk to minimize lactose malabsorption in preterm infants. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of the addition of lactase to milk compared to placebo or no intervention for the promotion of growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Primary outcomes: weight gain expressed as grams/kg/day, growth expressed as weight, length and head circumference percentile for postmenstrual age (PMA), assessed at birth and at 40 weeks PMA, days to achieve full enteral feeds. Secondary outcomes: several common outcomes associated with preterm birth, and adverse effects. Search methods Electronic and manual searches were conducted in January 2005 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library , 2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2005), EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2005), personal files, bibliographies of identified trials and abstracts by the Pediatric Academic Societies' Meetings and the European Society of Pediatric Research Meetings published in Pediatric Research. The searches were repeated in May 2012 of  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings from 2000 to 2012 (Abstracts2View). The Web of Science was searched using the only previously identified trial by Erasmus 2002 as the starting point to search for additional trials that cited this trial. Selection criteria Types of studies: randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials. Participants: preterm infants < 37 weeks PMA. Intervention: addition of lactase to milk versus placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were followed independently by the review authors to assess study quality and report outcomes. Treatment effects, calculated using Review Manager 5, included risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed‐effect model was used for meta‐analyses. We did not perform heterogeneity tests as only one study was identified. Main results The repeat searches conducted in May 2012 did not identify any additional studies for inclusion. One study enrolling 130 infants of 26 to 34 weeks PMA (mean postnatal age at entry 11 days) was identified and no identified study was excluded. The study was a double blind randomized controlled trial of high quality. Lactase treated feeds were initiated when enteral feedings provided > 75% of daily intake. None of the primary outcomes outlined in the protocol for this review and only one of the secondary outcomes, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were reported on. The RR for NEC was 0.32 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.79); the RD was ‐0.02 (95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.03) (a reduction which was not statistically significant). There was a statistically significant increase in weight gain at study day 10 in the lactase treated feeds group but not at any other time points. Overall, there was not a statistically significant effect on weight gain. No adverse effects were noted. Authors' conclusions The only randomized trial to date provides no evidence of significant benefit to preterm infants from adding lactase to their feeds. Further research regarding effectiveness and safety are required before practice recommendations can be made. Randomized controlled trials comparing lactase versus placebo treated feeds and enrolling infants when enteral feeds are introduced are required. The primary and secondary outcomes for effectiveness and safety should include those identified in this review.","Lactase treated feeds to promote growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants Very low birth weight preterm infants are often fed through a tube into a vein (parenterally) as adequate growth and nutrition is important for lung and brain development. Early feeding via the gut (enterally) stimulates motility and digestive activity and is associated with improved growth, but this is not always possible. Lactase is an intestinal enzyme that helps digest milk and is slow to develop in preterm infants after birth. Breast milk contains components that help with lactose digestion. Lactose intolerance is often managed in infants born at term with low‐lactose or lactose‐free formulas, but these do not fulfil the nutrition requirements for preterm infants. Feeding intolerance leaves residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding and causes abdominal distension, bile stained fluid in the lungs (aspirates), and vomiting. Preparations of lactase could potentially be added to formula or breast milk for preterm infants. There was not a significant effect on weight gain in the one randomized controlled trial identified that investigated addition of lactase. The review authors searched the medical literature thoroughly but found only this one high quality trial enrolling 130 preterm infants. No adverse effects were noted and lactase treated feeds appeared to be well tolerated.",CD004591
"Background Healthcare‐associated infections (HAIs) are a major threat to patient safety, and are associated with mortality rates varying from 5% to 35%. Important risk factors associated with HAIs are the use of invasive medical devices (e.g. central lines, urinary catheters and mechanical ventilators), and poor staff adherence to infection prevention practices during insertion and care for the devices when in place. There are specific risk profiles for each device, but in general, the breakdown of aseptic technique during insertion and care for the device, as well as the duration of device use, are important factors for the development of these serious and costly infections. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of different interventions, alone or in combination, which target healthcare professionals or healthcare organisations to improve professional adherence to infection control guidelines on device‐related infection rates and measures of adherence. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies up to June 2012: the Cochrane Effective Paractice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. We searched reference lists and contacted authors of included studies. We also searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies that complied with the Cochrane EPOC Group methodological criteria, and that evaluated interventions to improve professional adherence to guidelines for the prevention of device‐related infections. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane EPOC 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted authors of original papers to obtain missing information. Main results We included 13 studies: one cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) and 12 ITS studies, involving 40 hospitals, 51 intensive care units (ICUs), 27 wards, and more than 3504 patients and 1406 healthcare professionals. Six of the included studies targeted adherence to guidelines to prevent central line‐associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs); another six studies targeted adherence to guidelines to prevent ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP), and one study focused on interventions to improve urinary catheter practices. We judged all included studies to be at moderate or high risk of bias. The largest median effect on rates of VAP was found at nine months follow‐up with a decrease of 7.36 (‐10.82 to 3.14) cases per 1000 ventilator days (five studies and 15 sites). The one included cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) observed, improved urinary catheter practices five weeks after the intervention (absolute difference 12.2 percentage points), however, the statistical significance of this is unknown given a unit of analysis error. It is worth noting that N = 6 interventions that did result in significantly decreased infection rates involved more than one active intervention, which in some cases, was repeatedly administered over time, and further, that one intervention involving specialised oral care personnel showed the largest step change (‐22.9 cases per 1000 ventilator days (standard error (SE) 4.0), and also the largest slope change (‐6.45 cases per 1000 ventilator days (SE 1.42, P = 0.002)) among the included studies. We attempted to combine the results for studies targeting the same indwelling medical device (central line catheters or mechanical ventilators) and reporting the same outcomes (CLABSI and VAP rate) in two separate meta‐analyses, but due to very high statistical heterogeneity among included studies (I 2  up to 97%), we did not retain these analyses. Six of the included studies reported post‐intervention adherence scores ranging from 14% to 98%. The effect on rates of infection were mixed and the effect sizes were small, with the largest median effect for the change in level (interquartile range (IQR)) for the six CLABSI studies being observed at three months follow‐up was a decrease of 0.6 (‐2.74 to 0.28) cases per 1000 central line days (six studies and 36 sites). This change was not sustained over longer follow‐up times. Authors' conclusions The low to very low quality of the evidence of studies included in this review provides insufficient evidence to determine with certainty which interventions are most effective in changing professional behaviour and in what contexts. However, interventions that may be worth further study are educational interventions involving more than one active element and that are repeatedly administered over time, and interventions employing specialised personnel, who are focused on an aspect of care that is supported by evidence e.g. dentists/dental auxiliaries performing oral care for VAP prevention.","Can interventions to improve professional adherence to guidelines prevent device‐related infections? Healthcare‐associated infections (HAIs) are a major threat to patient safety, and are associated with mortality rates varying from 5% to 35%. Important risk factors associated with HAIs are the use of invasive medical devices (e.g. central lines, urinary catheters and mechanical ventilators) that breach the body's normal defence mechanisms, and poor staff adherence to infection prevention practices during insertion and care for the devices when in place.

We judged all studies to be at moderate to high risk of bias. The effect sizes were small with the largest median effect for studies addressing central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs) occurring immediately after the implementation of an intervention to improve adherence to guidelines, in the majority of studies this change was not sustained over longer follow‐up times. The median effect for studies aiming to reduce ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) was somewhat greater and was sustained up to 12 months follow‐up. The results of six studies that reported adherence/non‐adherence with infection control recommendations showed very varying adherence scores ranging from 14% to 98%.

"Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2004 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. Tinnitus can be described as the perception of sound in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. There are a number of reports in the literature suggesting that Ginkgo biloba may be effective in the management of tinnitus. However, there also appears to be a strong placebo effect in tinnitus management. Objectives To assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba in patients who are troubled by tinnitus. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; AMED; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 March 2012. Selection criteria Adults (18 years and over) complaining of tinnitus or adults with a primary complaint of cerebral insufficiency, where tinnitus forms part of the syndrome. Data collection and analysis Both original authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. For the 2012 update two authors determined trial eligibility, extracted data, analysed data and updated the contents of the review. Main results Four trials with a total of 1543 participants were included in the review; we assessed all the included studies as having a low risk of bias. Three trials (1143 participants) included patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus and one (400 participants) included patients with mild to moderate dementia, some of whom had tinnitus. There was no evidence that Gingko biloba was effective in patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus. In the study of patients with dementia, mean baseline levels of tinnitus were low (1.7 to 2.5 on a 10‐point subjective symptom rating scale). A small but statistically significant reduction of 1.5 and 0.7 points was seen in patients taking Gingko biloba with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease respectively. The practical clinical significance of this is unclear. The incidence of side effects was low. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence does not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.","Ginkgo biloba for tinnitus People with tinnitus hear sounds such as crackling or whistling in the absence of external noise. Noises appear to arise in the ears or inside the head and may be experienced all of the time, or only intermittently. The causes of tinnitus are not yet fully understood and a variety of treatments are offered including medication, psychotherapy, noise 'maskers' and tinnitus retraining therapy. The review of trials assessed the effectiveness of extract of Ginkgo biloba. Few good‐quality trials were found. Four studies were included in the review, with a total of 1543 participants. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias. There was no evidence that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.",CD003852
"Background Parent education and training programmes can improve maternal psychosocial health, child behavioural problems, and parenting practices. This review assesses the effects of parenting interventions for reducing child injury. Objectives To assess the effects of parenting interventions for preventing unintentional injury in children 18 years of age and younger and for increasing possession and use of safety equipment and safety practices by parents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Preview, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Social Science Citation Index, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC, DARE, ASSIA, Web of Science, SIGLE, and ZETOC. We also handsearched abstracts from the World Conferences on Injury Prevention and Control and from the journal  Injury Prevention . The searches were conducted in January 2011. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (non‐RCTs), and controlled before and after studies (CBAs), which evaluated parenting interventions administered to parents of children 18 years of age and younger and reported outcome data on injuries to children (unintentional or unspecified intent) and possession and use of safety equipment or safety practices (including the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scale, which contains an assessment of home safety) by parents. Parenting interventions were defined as those with a specified protocol, manual, or curriculum aimed at changing knowledge, attitudes, or skills covering a range of parenting topics. Data collection and analysis Studies were selected, data were extracted, and quality was appraised independently by two authors. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were estimated using random‐effects models. Main results Twenty‐two studies were included in the review: 16 RCTs, two non‐RCTs, one partially randomised trial that contained two randomised intervention arms and one non‐randomised control arm, two CBA studies, and one quasi‐randomised controlled trial. Seventeen studies provided interventions comprising parenting education and other support services, 15 of which were home visiting programmes and two of which were paediatric practice‐based interventions. Two provided solely educational interventions. Nineteen studies recruited families who were from socio‐economically disadvantaged populations who were at risk of adverse child outcomes or people who may benefit from extra support, such as single mothers, teenage mothers, first‐time mothers, and mothers with learning difficulties. Ten RCTs involving 5074 participants were included in the meta‐analysis, which indicated that intervention families had a statistically significant lower risk of injury than control families (RR 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.94). Sensitivity analyses undertaken that included only RCTs at low risk of various sources of bias found the findings to be robust to including only those studies at low risk of detection bias in terms of blinded outcome assessment and attrition bias in terms of follow‐up of fewer than 80% of participants in each arm. When analyses were restricted to studies at low risk of selection bias in terms of inadequate allocation concealment, the effect size was no longer statistically significant. Several studies found statistically significantly fewer home hazards or a greater number of safety practices in intervention families. Of ten studies reporting scores on the HOME scale, data from three RCTs were included in a meta‐analysis, which found no evidence of a difference in quality of the home environment between treatment arms (mean difference 0.57, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 1.72). Most of the studies reporting home safety practices, home hazards, or composite home safety scores found statistically significant effects favouring intervention arm families. Overall, when Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines (GRADE) were used, the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. Authors' conclusions Parenting interventions, most commonly provided within the home using multi‐faceted interventions, are effective in reducing child injury. Fairly consistent evidence suggests that they also improve home safety. This evidence relates mainly to interventions provided to families from disadvantaged populations, who are at risk of adverse child health outcomes, or whose families may benefit from extra support. Further research is required to explore mechanisms by which these interventions may reduce injury, to identify the features of parenting interventions that are necessary or sufficient to reduce injury, and to assess the generalisability of these findings to different population groups.","Parenting programmes for the prevention of unintentional injuries in childhood   This review looked at whether parent education and training programmes (called  parenting programmes ) help parents provide a safer home environment and reduce injuries in children. We undertook the review because several factors that can increase the risk of unintentional injury to children may be helped by parents' attending parenting programmes, such as mothers' mental health and child behaviour problems. In addition, injuries are more likely to occur when parents are unable to predict a child’s ability to perform tasks such as climbing furniture or opening locks. Parenting programmes may help parents develop realistic expectations of their child's behaviour based on age and stage of development. Therefore, we wanted to assess whether parenting programmes reduced the risk of unintentional injuries in children, and whether parents provided a safer home environment by using more items of safety equipment, such as stair gates, and by adopting safe practices such as keeping medicines out of reach. Through searches of databases and web sites, we found 22 randomised and non‐randomised studies that evaluated the effects of parenting programmes on childhood injuries or home safety. Fifteen of these were home visiting programmes that provided a range of support services, as well as parent education or training. These programmes were usually provided to families who were disadvantaged, whose children were considered to be at risk of poor health, or who may benefit from extra support. We pooled the results from 10 randomised controlled trials, which included a total of 5074 children, and found that children from families who had completed the parenting programmes had sustained fewer injuries than those from families who had not attended the programmes. We pooled the results from three randomized controlled trials that measured home safety using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) tool. The results from these three studies, which included a total of 368 children, showed no difference in HOME scores between families receiving parenting programmes and those not receiving these programmes. Overall, the quality of the studies was reasonable. We conclude that parenting programmes are effective in reducing unintentional injury in children and can improve home safety, particularly in families who may be considered 'at risk,' such as some teenage or single mothers. It would be worthwhile for health and social care providers to make parenting programmes available to families.",CD006020
"Background Schizophrenia has a lifetime prevalence of less than one per cent. Studies have indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early warning signs) often precede acute psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychological therapy on time to relapse, hospitalisation, functioning, negative and positive symptomatology. Search methods Search databases included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non‐affective psychosis Data collection and analysis We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach. Main results Thirty‐two RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that randomised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs interventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reported or poorly‐reported. Significantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Risk of re‐hospitalisation was significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual care (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to re‐hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Participants' satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evidence. Authors' conclusions This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re‐hospitalised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outside trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were used along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effective on their own. They may be cost‐effective due to reduced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services consider routinely providing psychological interventions involving the early recognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schizophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate quality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological interventions, or to clarify the kinds of additional psychological interventions that might aid its efficacy. Future RCTs should be adequately‐powered, and designed to minimise the risk of bias and be transparently reported. They should also systematically evaluate resource costs and resource use, alongside efficacy outcomes and other outcomes that are important to people with serious mental illness and their carers.","Training to recognise the early signs of recurrence in schizophrenia Many people with schizophrenia experience periods of illness followed by relatively stable periods (although symptoms of illness such as hearing voices and seeing things often remain in the background). This means that many people with schizophrenia may become unwell again and need to go back into hospital. Training in early warning signs techniques encourages people to learn, detect and recognise the early warning signs of future illness. Studies indicate that noticing even small changes in signs and symptoms of schizophrenia can often predict future illness and relapse two to 10 weeks later. Early warning training may help to prevent or delay relapse, so reducing the chances of going into hospital. Recognition of early warning signs requires detailed history taking, sometimes with additional techniques such as diary keeping, completion of questionnaires and a plan of action based on anticipated early warning signs. Training can be undertaken by the individual or be group‐based, involving health professionals, family members or carers. Successful training seems to require around 12 sessions and involves therapists of high competency.     This review includes a total of 34 studies. It found that there are positive benefits of training in early warning signs. It reduces rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation (but not on time to recurrence). It should be noted that training in early warning signs was mainly used alongside other psychological therapies, so it is not entirely clear what proportion of the positive effect is due to training in early warning signs alone. Moreover, the overall quality of the evidence from these studies was judged to be very low. This means that we do not know if interventions using early warning signs, with or without additional psychological treatments, will have the same beneficial effects outside clinical trials.     Further research is required to decide whether training in early warning signs is effective on its own. Effects on quality of life, satisfaction with care, money spent, and burden of care for carers are unclear, so ideally should be known before training programmes are put into wider use. At this time, there is not enough evidence to support training in early warning signs alone. This plain language summary was written by consumer, Ben Gray of RETHINK.",CD005147
"Background Eczema is a common skin disease in many countries, and although the majority of cases of eczema occur before the age of five years and often resolve during childhood or adolescence, it can also persist into adulthood. Itch is the most important aspect of eczema, often impacting significantly on the quality of life of an affected individual. Objectives To assess the effects of oral antihistamines (H1 antagonists) as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. Search methods We searched the following databases up to March 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We examined the reference lists of excluded studies in order to identify further references to relevant trials. We searched trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials. We also handsearched the abstracts of the International Research Workshops on eczema, as well as the conference proceedings of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), from 2000 to 2011. Selection criteria We sought to include randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects and safety of oral H1 antihistamines as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. We excluded studies that compared an antihistamine versus another antihistamine and had no placebo control arm. We also excluded topical antihistamines and oral H1 antihistamines as 'add‐on' therapy and studies using any concomitant therapy other than emollients or moisturisers, principally because some of these forms of concomitant therapy may be considered treatment modifiers in assessments of the effects of antihistamines on eczema. Data collection and analysis Our search retrieved 409 references to studies. Based on assessments of their titles, abstracts, or both, we excluded all except 36 of these studies. After evaluation of the full text of each report, we excluded a further 35 studies, and 1 study is awaiting classification pending a response from the trial investigators. Two review authors independently carried out study assessment. Main results No randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is currently no high‐level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of oral H1 antihistamines used as monotherapy for eczema. Because most of the studies allowed the use of concomitant medications and involved multi‐therapeutic approaches, meaningful assessments of the individual effects of oral H1 antihistamines on eczema were not feasible. Although well‐designed randomised controlled trials excluding concomitant medications appear to be needed, consideration should be given to the potential ethical issues raised with the use of antihistamines as monotherapy for the management of eczema by withholding the use of rescue or additional therapies. A further systematic review of studies in which concomitant therapies were permitted might be of value in determining the potential benefits of oral H1 antihistamines as add‐on therapy.","Effects of antihistamines on eczema Eczema is a common chronic disease. Itch is the most important symptom, and eczema is often accompanied by dry skin. Skin lesions include rash, redness, swelling of the skin, crusts, oozing, and sometimes also bleeding as a consequence of persistent scratching. Although the disease can resolve during childhood, it might also recur in or persist into adult life. The cause of eczema is considered to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Moisturisers, topical corticosteroids, and topical immunomodulators are the mainstay during treatment of eczema, while more severe cases might need UV light therapy or systemic immunosuppressants. Itch is very difficult to treat and leads to scratching, which leads to more inflammation of the skin, and often people with eczema end up in a vicious circle of itching and scratching. The role of histamine in itching associated with eczema is not fully elucidated, but oral H1 antihistamines have been used for many years in the treatment of eczema. These might have been used largely for their sedative action, with highly sedative antihistamines, e.g. chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine. However, oral H1 antihistamines are widely used in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as urticaria, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis, but their efficacy in alleviating itch and eczema remains unclear. This systematic review sought evidence for the effects and safety of the use of oral antihistamines for eczema, to guide their use in clinical practice. No study matched our inclusion criteria. There is currently no evidence to support the efficacy or safety of the use of oral H1 antihistamines alone in the treatment of eczema. This does not mean that such antihistamines could not be useful as an add‐on therapy to the main treatments including topical steroids, which will be the topic of a further review.",CD007770
"Background Extramedullary fixation of hip fractures involves the application of a plate and screws to the lateral side of the proximal femur. In external fixators, the stabilising component is held outside the thigh by pins or screws driven into the bone. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1998, and last updated in 2005. Objectives To assess the relative effects of different types of extramedullary fixation implant, as well as external fixators, for treating extracapsular proximal femoral (hip) fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 4 2011), EMBASE (1988 to 2011 Week 25), various other databases, conference proceedings and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing extramedullary implants or external fixators for fixing extracapsular hip fracture in adults were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate. Main results The 18 included trials tested seven comparisons in a total of 2615 mainly female and older participants with a total of 2619 fractures. All trials had methodological flaws that may affect the validity of their results. Three trials of 355 participants comparing a fixed nail plate (Jewett or McLaughlin) with the sliding hip screw (SHS) found an increased risk of fixation failure for fixed nail plates. The two trials of 433 participants comparing the Resistance Augmented Bateaux (RAB) plate with the SHS had contrasting results, notably in terms of operative complications, fixation failure and anatomical restoration. One trial of 100 participants comparing the Pugh nail and the SHS found no significant difference between implants. Three trials of 458 participants compared the Medoff plate with the SHS. There was a trend to higher blood losses and longer operation times for the Medoff plate along with a trend to a lower risk of fixation failure with the Medoff plate for unstable trochanteric fractures. Two trials of 676 participants compared the Medoff plate with three different screw‐plate systems. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome for trochanteric fractures. For subtrochanteric fractures, there was a lower fixation failure rate for the Medoff plate but no evidence for differences in longer‐term outcomes. Four trials of 396 participants comparing the Gotfried percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) with a SHS found a trend to lower blood loss and transfusion requirements for the PCCP but no other confirmed differences in outcomes between implants. Three of the trials reported intra‐operative problems with the PCCP, some of which precluded its use. Three trials of 200 participants comparing external fixation with a SHS found less operative trauma for the external fixation. Final outcome appeared similar. Authors' conclusions The markedly increased fixation failure rate of fixed nail plates compared with the SHS is a major consideration and thus the SHS appears preferable. There was insufficient evidence from other comparisons of extramedullary implants or on the use of external fixators to draw definite conclusions.","Fixation devices secured across the fracture that are placed either directly or externally for treating hip fractures located outside the hip joint Hip fractures located outside the hip joint capsule (extracapsular hip fractures) may be surgically fixed using metal implants. Often these are extramedullary devices consisting of a screw or rod, inserted in the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) to bridge (fix) the fracture, connected to a plate secured to the femur. Sometimes external fixators are used. In these, the stabilising component is held outside the thigh by pins or screws driven into the bone on either side of the fracture. The 18 randomised controlled trials included in this review tested seven comparisons in a total of 2615 mainly female and older participants. All trials had methodological flaws that may affect the validity of their results and there was a general lack of evidence on long‐term effects and functional recovery. Some extramedullary implants appeared to be associated with an increased risk of fixation complications and reoperation. In particular, three trials comparing a fixed nail plate (Jewett or McLaughlin) with the sliding hip screw (the 'standard' extramedullary device for these fractures) found an increased risk of fixation failure for fixed nail plates. Less invasive implants, such as the external fixator, which require smaller incisions resulted in less blood loss and often quicker operations than the sliding hip screw. We concluded that the sliding hip screw seems preferable to older types of fixed nail plates given their high rate of implant and fixation failure. However, there was not enough evidence to draw conclusions for other comparisons of extramedullary implants or on the use of external fixators.",CD000339
"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents have been used to treat anemia, one of the extra‐articular manifestations of RA. Although anemia is less of a problem now because of the reduction in inflammation due to disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), it could still be an issue in countries where DMARDs are not yet accessible. Objectives We assessed the clinical benefits and harms of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  (issue 7 2012), Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (1948 to 7 August 2012), OVID EMBASE (1980 to 7 August 2012), LILACS (1982 to 7 August 2012), the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization, reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients aged 16 years or over, with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis affected by anemia. We considered health‐related quality of life, fatigue and safety as the primary outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently performed trial selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. We estimated difference in means with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We estimated risk ratios with 95% CIs for binary outcomes. Main results We included three RCTs with a total of 133 participants. All trials compared human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO), for different durations (8, 12 and 52 weeks), versus placebo. All RCTs assessed health‐related quality of life. All trials had high or unclear risk of bias for most domains, and were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Two trials administered EPO by a subcutaneous route while the other used an intravenous route. We decided not to pool results from trials, due to inconsistencies in the reporting of results. Health‐related quality of life: subcutaneous EPO – one trial with 70 patients at 52 weeks showed a statistically significant difference in improvement of patient global assessment (median and interquartile range 3.5 (1.0 to 6.0) compared with placebo 4.5 (2.0 to 7.5) (P = 0.027) on a VAS scale (0 to 10)). The other shorter term trials (12 weeks with subcutaneous EPO and eight weeks with intravenous administration) did not find statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups in health‐related quality of life outcomes. Change in hemoglobin: both trials of subcutaneous EPO showed a statistically significant difference in increasing hemoglobin levels; (i) at  52 weeks (one trial, 70 patients), intervention hemoglobin level (median 134, interquartile range 110 to 158 g/litre) compared with the placebo group level (median 112, interquartile range; 86 to 128 g/litre) (P = 0.0001); (ii) at  12 weeks (one trial, 24 patients) compared with placebo (difference in means 8.00, 95% CI 7.43 to 8.57). Intravenous EPO at eight weeks showed no statistically significant difference in increasing hematocrit level for EPO versus placebo (difference in means 4.69, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 9.55; P = 0.06). Information on withdrawals due to adverse events was not reported in two trials, and one trial found no serious adverse events leading to withdrawals. None of the trials reported withdrawals due to high blood pressure, or to lack of efficacy or to fatigue. Authors' conclusions We found conflicting evidence for erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents to increase quality of life and hemoglobin level by treating anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, this conclusion is based on randomized controlled trials with a high risk of bias, and relies on trials assessing human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO). The safety profile of EPO is unclear. Future trials assessing erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis should be conducted by independent researchers and reported according to the CONSORT statements. Trials should be based on Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) and The Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) approaches for combining both clinician and patient perspectives.","Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  After searching for all relevant studies, they found three studies covering 133 people. Their findings are summarised below: The review shows that in people with anemia and rheumatoid arthritis: ‐ it is uncertain whether erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents improve quality of life or hemoglobin levels.  ‐ it is unknown whether erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents improve fatigue, as this was not measured by the studies. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects, which may include thromboembolic complications.  What is anemia in rheumatoid arthritis and what are erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents?  When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes them swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of the hands and feet are usually affected first.  As the disease progresses, other complications may appear, including anemia (low hemoglobin level). Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.  Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.  Erythropoietin is a hormone produced in the kidney, which increases the production of red blood cells. Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents work to increase red blood cell production.",CD000332
"Background Bacillus Calmette‐Guerín (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine to prevent tuberculosis, routinely administered at birth as part of the World Health Organization global expanded immunisation programme. Given intradermally, it can cause adverse reactions, including local, regional, distant and disseminated manifestations that may cause parental distress. Rarely, it can cause serious illness and even death. Among those patients with immunocompromised conditions, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the complication rate is even higher. Objectives To assess the effects of different interventions for treating BCG‐induced disease in children. Search methods The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in  The Cochrane Library  ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (1947 to November 2012); and LILACS (1980 to November 2012). The metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the WHO trials search portal. Conference proceedings for relevant abstracts and experts were also contacted to identify studies. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical or surgical treatment modality for BCG‐induced disease in children. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently evaluated titles, applied inclusion criteria, and assessed the risk of bias of studies. The primary outcomes were the failure rate of therapies for all types of BCG vaccine‐induced complications and the time to resolution of illness measured in months. The secondary outcomes were death from BCG vaccine‐induced disease and the all‐cause mortality. Risk ratios (RRs) were used as measure of effect for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Main results Five RCTs analysing 341 children addressed the primary outcomes and were included. Four arms compared oral antibiotics to no intervention or placebo, one arm evaluated needle aspiration compared to no intervention, and another evaluated the use of locally instilled isoniazid versus oral erythromycin. Two small studies evaluated oral isoniazid; we are uncertain of whether this intervention has an effect on clinical failure (RR 1.48; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.78; 54 participants, two studies, very low quality evidence). Similarly, for oral erythromycin, we are uncertain if there is an effect (clinical failure RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.53; 148 participants, three studies, very low quality evidence), and for oral isoniazid plus rifampicin (clinical failure, RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83; 35 participants, one study, very low quality evidence). In patients with lymphadenitis abscess, needle aspiration may reduce clinically persistent BCG‐induced disease at 6 to 9 months of follow‐up (RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.55; 77 participants, one study, low quality evidence). In another study of patients with the same condition, aspiration plus local instillation of isoniazid reduces time to clinical cure compared to aspiration plus oral erythromycin (mean difference 1.49 months less; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.15 less; 27 participants, one study). No RCTs of HIV‐infected infants with a BCG‐induced disease evaluated the use of antibiotics or other therapies for reducing the rate of clinical failure or the time to clinical resolution. No data on mortality secondary to the interventions for treating BCG‐induced disease were reported. Authors' conclusions It is unclear if oral antibiotics (isoniazid, erythromycin, or a combination of isoniazid plus rifampicin) are effective for the resolution of BCG‐induced disease. Most non‐suppurated lymphadenitis will resolve without treatment in 4 to 6 months. Patients with lymphadenitis abscess might benefit from needle aspiration and possibly local instillation of isoniazid could shorten recovery time. Included studies were generally small and could be better conducted. Further research should evaluate the use of needle aspiration and local instillation of isoniazid in fluctuant nodes. Therapeutic and preventive measures in HIV‐infected infants could be important given the higher risk of negative outcomes in this group. 23 April 2019 No update planned Other Although the CIDG conducted a new search up to 23 Jul, 2018 for potentially relevant studies, these studies have not yet been incorporated into this Cochrane Review as this review is not a current priority for update by CIDG.","Therapies for BCG induced disease in children Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) is a widely used tuberculosis vaccine derived from a non‐infectious strain of the bovine tuberculosis bacillus ( Mycobacterium bovis ) and mainly given to young children. Usually, the only adverse reaction to the vaccine is an ulcer at the site of injection, which may leave a small scar. Very occasionally, however, especially in children with weakened immune systems, the vaccine can cause more serious side effects. These can include local infections at the injection site, which may spread to the lymph nodes, causing lymphadenopathy, and the bones, and can even prove life‐threatening. These adverse reactions to the BCG vaccine are a particular risk for children infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), where the condition is known as BCG immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (BCG‐IRIS). In many cases, the infections resolve without any intervention, but treatments can include oral antibiotics, needle aspiration, draining abscesses, and surgically removing infected lymph nodes. This review was conducted to try to determine the effectiveness of these different treatments. The review found no evidence of any benefit of using oral antibiotics to treat local or regional BCG‐induced disease. In patients with abscess‐forming lymphadenopathy, the only intervention with proven benefit was needle aspiration of the abscesses with or without local injection of the antibiotic isoniazid. Based on these findings, the review authors recommend a 'wait and see' approach with follow‐up visits for minor reactions and lymphadenopathy without abscesses. For abscess‐forming lymphadenopathy, which can cause distress and discomfort, they advise needle aspiration. However, this review is based on only five studies, all of which were assessed as having a low or very low quality of evidence. As a consequence, the authors conclude there is an urgent need for more and better studies on ways to prevent and treat BCG‐induced disease, especially BCG‐IRIS.",CD008300
"Background Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is commonly used to switch off (down regulate) the pituitary gland and thus suppress ovarian activity in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Other fertility drugs (gonadotrophins) are then used to stimulate ovulation in a controlled manner. Among the various types of pituitary down regulation protocols in use, the long protocol achieves the best clinical pregnancy rate. The long protocol requires GnRHa administration until suppression of ovarian activity occurs, within approximately 14 days. GnRHa can be used either as daily low‐dose injections or through a single injection containing higher doses of the drug (depot). It is unclear which of these two forms of administration is best, and whether single depot administration may require higher doses of gonadotrophins. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of a single depot dose of GHRHa versus daily GnRHa doses in women undergoing IVF. Search methods We searched the following databases: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched July 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2012), EMBASE (1980 to July 2012) and LILACS (1982 to July 2012). We also screened the reference lists of articles. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing depot and daily administration of GnRHa for long protocols in IVF treatment cycles in couples with any cause of infertility, using various methods of ovarian stimulation. The primary review outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Other outcomes included number of oocytes retrieved, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, number of gonadotrophin (FSH) units used for ovarian stimulation, duration of gonadotrophin treatment, cost and patient convenience. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed study quality. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per woman randomised. Where appropriate, we pooled studies. Main results Sixteen studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 1811 participants), 12 (n = 1366 participants) of which were suitable for meta‐analysis. No significant heterogeneity was detected. There were no significant differences between depot GnRHa and daily GnRHa in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.31, seven studies, 873 women), but substantial differences could not be ruled out. Thus for a woman with a 24% chance of achieving a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using GnRHa depot would be between 18% and 29%. There was no significant difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.23, 11 studies, 1259 women). For a woman with a 30% chance of achieving clinical pregnancy using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using GnRHa depot would be between 25% and 35%. There was no significant difference between the groups in the rate of severe OHSS (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.42, five studies, 570 women), but substantial differences could not be ruled out. For a woman with a 3% chance of severe OHSS using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding risk using GnRHa depot would be between 1% and 6%. Compared to women using daily GnRHa, those on depot administration required significantly more gonadotrophin units for ovarian stimulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.43, 11 studies, 1143 women) and a significantly longer duration of gonadotrophin use (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84, 10 studies, 1033 women). Study quality was unclear due to poor reporting. Only four studies reported live births as an outcome and only five described adequate methods for concealment of allocation. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of a significant difference between depot and daily GnRHa use for pituitary down regulation in IVF cycles using the long protocol, but substantial differences could not be ruled out. Since depot GnRHa requires more gonadotrophins and a longer duration of use, it may increase the overall costs of IVF treatment.","Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist for improving fertility Women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) need to take a series of hormones. The use of the drug GnRHa (gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist) during one stage of this process increases the chance of pregnancy. There are several options for GnRHa use. Long courses of GnRHa can be given either as daily low‐dose injections, or using a single higher‐dose longer‐acting injection (depot version). The review of 16 randomised controlled trials found no evidence that depot versus daily GnRHa injections produce different rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, substantial differences could not be ruled out. For example, for a woman with a 25% chance of achieving a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using GnRHa depot, the corresponding chance using daily injection would be between 16% and 30%. For a woman with a 25% risk of severe OHSS using GnRHa depot, the corresponding risk using daily injection would be between 4% and 89%. For a woman with a 25% chance of achieving a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using a depot injection would be between 19% and 30% . For a woman with a 25 % chance of severe OHSS using daily GnRHa injections, the corresponding chance using GnRHa depot would be between 9 % and 45 % . Depot GnRHa may increase the cost of an IVF cycle, because it lengthens the period to ovulation and requires the use of higher doses of other hormone drugs. The quality of the studies was unclear due to poor reporting, and only four studies reported live births.",CD002808
"Background Oesophageal cancer is a global heath problem. The prognosis for advanced oesophageal cancer is generally unfavourable, but early‐stage asymptomatic oesophageal cancer is basically curable and could achieve better survival rates. The two most commonly used tests are cytologic examination and endoscopy with mucosal iodine staining. The efficacy of the screening tests is controversial, and the true benefit and efficacy of screening remains uncertain because of the potential lead‐time and length‐time biases. This review was conducted to examine the evidence for the efficacy of screening for oesophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma). Objectives To determine the efficacy of early screening, using endoscopy with iodine staining or cytologic examination, in reducing mortality from oesophageal cancer in asymptomatic individuals from high‐risk and general populations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 8),  The Cochrane Library  (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985 to August 2012), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (January 1975 to August 2012), VIP Database (January 1989 to August 2012), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 1979 to August 2012), and the Internet. We also searched reference lists, conference proceedings, and databases of ongoing trials. There was no restriction on language or publication status in the search for trials. Selection criteria We included only randomised controlled trials (RCT) of screening versus no screening for oesophageal cancer. Randomisation of groups or clusters of individuals was acceptable. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently scanned the titles and abstracts from the initial search for potential trials for inclusion. We did not find any trials that met the inclusion criteria. Main results The electronic search identified 3482 studies. Two authors independently reviewed the references. The reports of 18 studies were retrieved for further investigation. None met the eligibility criteria for a RCT investigation of the effects of screening versus no screening for oesophageal cancer. Authors' conclusions There were no RCTs that determined the efficacy of screening for oesophageal cancer. Non‐RCTs showed a high incidence and the reported better survival after screening could be caused by selection bias, lead‐time and length‐time biases. RCTs are needed to determine the efficacy of screening for oesophageal cancer.","Screening for oesophageal cancer Oesophageal cancer is a common cause of cancer related death in the world. The prognosis in the advanced stages is unfavourable, but the early oesophageal cancers are asymptomatic and curable, and usually go undetected until they have spread beyond the oesophageal wall. Endoscopy with iodine staining or cytologic examination are two common screening tests for early oesophageal cancer. These screening tests were started in the 1970s, but the true benefit is inconsistent and is uncertain due to lead‐time bias, which is the amount of time by which the diagnosis is advanced by the screening procedure; and length‐time bias, where screening is more likely to detect slow‐growing disease rather than altering the person's duration of life. This review intended to determine the efficacy of the two screening tests for oesophageal cancer. We identified 3482 studies but none were RCTs of screening. Several non‐comparative studies showed that the screening tests may increase the incidence of reported oesophageal cancer and improve the survival results after a screening test, but these results could indicate bias rather than a true causative effect. Therefore, there is a strong need for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), especially long‐term RCTs, to determine the efficacy, cost‐effectiveness, and any adverse effects of screening for oesophageal cancer.",CD007883
"Background Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially stigmatising and stressful condition which affects around 15% to 20% of five‐year olds and up to 2% of young adults. Although there is a high rate of spontaneous remission, the social, emotional and psychological costs to the children can be great. Drugs (including desmopressin, tricyclics and other drugs) have often been tried to treat nocturnal enuresis. Objectives To assess the effects of drugs other than desmopressin and tricyclics on nocturnal enuresis in children and to compare them with other interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials (searched 15 December 2011), which includes searches of MEDLINE and CENTRAL, to identify published and unpublished randomised and quasi‐randomised trials. The reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. Selection criteria All randomised trials of drugs (excluding desmopressin or tricyclics) for treating nocturnal enuresis in children up to the age of 16 years were included in the review. Trials were eligible for inclusion if children were randomised to receive drugs compared with placebo, other drugs or behavioral interventions for nocturnal enuresis. Studies which included children with daytime urinary incontinence or children with organic conditions were also included in this review if the focus of the study was on nocturnal enuresis. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting and trials of adults with nocturnal enuresis were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials and extracted data. Differences between review authors were settled by discussion with a third review author. Main results A total of 40 randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (10 new in this update) met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1780 out of 2440 children who enrolled receiving an active drug other than desmopressin or a tricyclic. In all, 31 different drugs or classes of drugs were tested. The trials were generally small or of poor methodological quality. There was an overall paucity of data regarding outcomes after treatment was withdrawn. For drugs versus placebo, when compared to placebo indomethacin (risk ratio [RR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79), diazepam (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.46), mestorelone (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.62) and atomoxetine (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94) appeared to reduce the number of children failing to have 14 consecutive dry nights. Although indomethacin and diclofenac were better than placebo during treatment, they were not as effective as desmopressin and there was a higher chance of adverse effects. None of the medications were effective in reducing relapse rates, although this was only reported in five placebo controlled trials. For drugs versus drugs, combination therapy with imipramine and oxybutynin was more effective than imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94) and also had significantly lower relapse rates than imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77). There was an overall paucity of data regarding outcomes after treatment was withdrawn. For drugs versus behavioural therapy, bedwetting alarms were found to be better than amphetamine (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.29), oxybutynin (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.98), and oxybutynin plus holding exercises (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.84 to 6.18) in reducing the number of children failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights. Adverse effects of drugs were seen in 19 trials while 17 trials did not adequately report the occurrence of side effects. Authors' conclusions There was not enough evidence to judge whether or not the included drugs cured bedwetting when used alone. There was limited evidence to suggest that desmopressin, imipramine and enuresis alarms therapy were better than the included drugs to which they were compared. In other reviews, desmopressin, tricyclics and alarm interventions have been shown to be effective during treatment. There was also evidence to suggest that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increased the efficacy of other established therapies such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms by reducing the relapse rates, by about 20%, although it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy. Future studies should evaluate the role of combination therapy against established treatments in rigorous and adequately powered trials.","Drug treatment for children with bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) but not including the drug types desmopressin or tricyclics Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is the involuntary loss of urine at night without an underlying organic disease as the cause. It can result in social problems, sibling teasing and lowered self esteem. It affects around 15% to 20% of five‐year olds, and up to 2% of adults. Many different types of drugs have been used to treat children with bed wetting. There is not enough reliable evidence to show that drugs other than desmopressin or tricyclics reduce bedwetting in children during treatment when used in isolation, despite their risk of unwanted side effects. In other Cochrane reviews, alarms triggered by wetting, desmopressin and tricyclic drugs have been shown to work during treatment. However, alarms have a more sustained effect than desmopressin and tricyclics after treatment has finished. The adverse effects of alarm therapy (tiredness and waking other members of the family) are relatively benign and self limiting compared with the adverse effects of drugs. One class of drugs (anticholinergic drugs) appears to improve the efficacy of other established treatments such as tricyclics, bedwetting alarms and desmopressin. The cost of treating children with bedwetting with alarm therapy or drugs may vary in different countries.",CD002238
"Background Pneumothorax is a potentially life‐threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis. Spontaneous pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space and can be subdivided into first episode and recurrent. The recurrence of pneumothorax is when it occurs on the same side seven days or more after initial resolution. A pneumothorax is persistent if the air leak lasts for more than five days ( Schidlow 1993 ). Managing spontaneous pneumothoraces is controversial and there is no standard treatment. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. While surgical interventions are felt to be more effective in people without cystic fibrosis, the complications directly related to the procedure, as well as the post‐operative complications make surgical interventions riskier for people with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, these interventions have the potential to make people with cystic fibrosis ineligible for lung transplantation in the future. Therefore, the benefits and side effects or disadvantages for the medical and surgical treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis need to be systematically reviewed. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of different treatment interventions for managing spontaneous persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 29 October 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials which compared the use of chemical pleurodesis to surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in CF. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review Authors' conclusions Pneumothorax is a potentially life‐threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis and the management of spontaneous pneumothoraces remains a topic of considerable controversy. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in this population. However, it is disappointing that neither intervention has been assessed by randomised controlled trials. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing both efficacy and possible adverse effects of the use of chemical pleurodesis versus surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Due to a current lack of research in this area, while searches will still be undertaken every two years, the review will only be updated if any new evidence comes to light.","Chemicals for sticking the outer lung surface to surrounding membranes compared to surgery to stop air persistently collecting in the chest Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which irreversibly damages the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis are prone to getting a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the space between the two linings of the lungs. It can potentially kill people with cystic fibrosis because of the added stress on the heart and lungs. It can be treated by surgical and non‐surgical interventions. However, although these treatments are generally effective, they are far from perfect. Certain treatments work in some people but not others. Also, the treatments do have side effects and can be dangerous for people with cystic fibrosis. Currently, physicians do not know the safest and most effective way of treating pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the surgical and non‐surgical treatments for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, more research is needed in this field. Future studies should compare the safety and efficacy of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. There is currently no research being undertaken in this area. We will continue to search for evidence, but will not be updating the review until we find new evidence.",CD007481
"Background Anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is a pre‐malignant condition of the anal canal transitional epithelium that is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The incidence and prevalence of AIN and anal cancer are increasing rapidly in HIV‐positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Other groups like HIV‐negative MSM, immunosuppressed patients and people affected by other HPV diseases like genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) may also develop AIN. The condition is complicated by its multicentric and multifocal nature and high rates of relapse and morbidity. Targeted excisions using ablative treatments such as cautery, infrared coagulation (IRC) and cryotherapy have been used as first‐line therapeutic strategies, and there are many other options. There is no consensus about the optimal management of AIN. Objectives To evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions for anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to October 2011). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts in the field and manufacturers of any AIN and HPV‐specific treatments. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed any type of intervention for AIN. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. If it was possible, the data were synthesised in a meta‐analysis. Main results We found only one RCT, which included 53 patients, that met our inclusion criteria. This trial reported data on imiquimod versus placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of disease cure but there was a trend for imiquimod to downgrade the AIN to a low‐risk stage. The lack of statistical power of the trial may be due to the small number of patients in each group. The risk of bias was estimated as moderate. Authors' conclusions The included trial failed to demonstrate any statistically significant efficacy of imiquimod in the management of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The absence of reliable evidence for any of the interventions used in AIN precludes any definitive guidance or recommendations for clinical practice. Prospective cohort studies and retrospective studies have not been included in this review as they are considered to provide lower quality evidence. Well designed RCTs are needed.","Comparison of interventions for patients diagnosed with pre‐cancerous changes of the anal canal (anal intraepithelial neoplasia) Persistent infection with some types of human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause anal canal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), a condition which may become cancerous. HPV is transmitted via skin‐to‐skin contact. There are over 100 different types of HPV virus. At least 30 of these can be sexually transmitted. HPV transmission occurs easily among sexual partners. Despite this, spontaneous clearance of the infection is generally the rule. In some cases, HPV may produce genital warts or even some anogenital pre‐malignant or malignant lesions. The latter is especially the case when some HPV types (which are named 'high‐risk' HPV, like HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33) persist on anogenital mucosa or skin over long periods of time. Viral persistence is very common in an HIV‐positive population, particularly in the anal mucosa of men who have sex with men. The incidence of AIN is reaching epidemic proportions in this population group. AIN is usually asymptomatic. People at risk need to be under prevention screening programs in order to identify and treat those pre‐cancerous lesions. To date there is no consensus on AIN management. The most used strategies are ablative treatments. Lesions in the anal canal are treated with cautery, infrared coagulation, laser or cryotherapy. Other available options include surgical excision, topical treatments (imiquimod, trichloroacetic acid, 5‐fluorouracil), interferon and HPV vaccines. We identified many studies that examined all the interventions mentioned above. Only one trial with 53 patients was randomized and placebo‐controlled and could be included in this review. The trial compared self‐application of imiquimod cream in the anal canal with placebo. The analysis of the findings could not demonstrate a definitive superior effect of imiquimod compared with placebo in terms or cure. Some effectiveness could be observed in terms of improvement, with high‐risk stages of AIN being reduced to low‐risk stages. We conclude that the available information on AIN treatment does not meet evidence‐based medicine requirements. Future trials should be designed as randomized controlled trials, and should include data about HPV load and the types affecting the treated patients, recurrence rates, progression to anal cancer and quality of life of patients.",CD009244
"Background Lifestyle changes and cardiovascular prevention measures are a primary treatment for intermittent claudication (IC). Symptomatic treatment with vasoactive agents (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) for medicines from the World Health Organisation class CO4A) is controversial. Objectives To evaluate evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral naftidrofuryl (ATC CO4 21) versus placebo on the pain‐free walking distance (PFWD) of people with IC by using a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data (IPD). Search methods For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched October 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9). For the original review the authors handsearched the  European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery  (1984 to 1994) and checked relevant bibliographies. They contacted the registration holder of naftidrofuryl and the authors of identified trials for any unpublished data. Selection criteria We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with low or moderate risk of bias for which the IPD were available. Data collection and analysis We collected data from the electronic data file or from the case report form and checked the data by a statistical quality control procedure. All randomized patients were analyzed following the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) principle. The geometric mean of the relative improvement in PFWD was calculated for both treatment groups in all identified studies. The effect of the drug was assessed compared with placebo on final walking distance (WDf) using multilevel and random‐effect models and adjusting for baseline walking distance (WD0). For the responder analysis, therapeutic success was defined as an improvement of walking distance of at least 50%. Main results We included seven studies in the IPD (n = 1266 patients). One of these studies (n = 183) was only used in the sensitivity analysis so that the main analysis included 1083 patients. The ratio of the relative improvement in PFWD (naftidrofuryl compared with placebo) was 1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.49, P < 0.001). The absolute difference in responder rate, or proportion successfully treated, was 22.3% (95% CI 17.1% to 27.6%). The calculated number needed to treat was 4.5 (95% CI 3.6 to 5.8). Authors' conclusions Oral naftidrofuryl has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful, although moderate, effect of improving walking distance in the six months after initiation of therapy for people with intermittent claudication. Access by researchers to data from RCTs that are suitable for IPD analysis should be possible through repositories of data from pharmacological trials. Regular formal appraisal of the balance of risk and benefit is needed for older pharmaceutical products.","Naftidrofuryl for intermittent claudication Patients with narrowed arteries of the lower limbs may be hampered by pain in their calves after relatively short walks. This limits the distance they can walk, and hence their quality of life. This is a sure sign of atherosclerosis. These patients are at greater risk of cardiovascular death and should take preventive measures. The symptoms of the disease can be alleviated by smoking cessation and exercise. The question is whether specific drugs such as naftidrofuryl also reduce symptoms, more than placebo. To answer the question, we collected all published reports of randomized trials where the drug was compared with placebo. In addition, we went back to the original data of individual patients and made one big database with all data from all patients from all trials. We included seven studies with a total of 1266 patients. The improvement of pain‐free walking distance was 37% larger in the naftidrofuryl group than the improvement observed in the placebo group. In the naftidrofuryl group 55% of the patients improved by more than 50%, compared with 30% of patients on placebo. Naftidrofuryl 200 mg (taken three times a day by mouth) improved walking distance in the six months after the start of therapy.",CD001368
"Background Preventive health care promotes health and prevents disease or injuries by addressing factors that lead to the onset of a disease, and by detecting latent conditions to reduce or halt their progression. Many risk factors for costly and disabling conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) can be prevented, yet healthcare systems do not make the best use of their available resources to support this process. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could offer a convenient and cost‐effective way to support desirable health behaviours for preventive health care. Objectives To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging interventions as a mode of delivery for preventive health care, on health status and health behaviour outcomes. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library  2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before‐after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies using SMS or MMS as a mode of delivery for any type of preventive health care. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of interest were health status and health behaviour outcomes. We also considered patients’ and providers’ evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. Because the included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures, we did not consider that it was justified to conduct a meta‐analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories; instead, we present findings narratively. Main results We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1933 participants. For the primary outcome category of health, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that women who received prenatal support via mobile phone messages had significantly higher satisfaction than those who did not receive the messages, both in the antenatal period (mean difference (MD) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.72) and perinatal period (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.01). Their confidence level was also higher (MD 1.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.73) and anxiety level was lower (MD ‐2.15, 95% CI ‐3.42 to ‐0.88) than in the control group in the antenatal period. In this study, no further differences were observed between groups in the perinatal period. There was low quality evidence that the mobile phone messaging intervention did not affect pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at birth, infant birth weight, preterm delivery and route of delivery). For the primary outcome category of health behaviour, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that mobile phone message reminders to take vitamin C for preventive reasons resulted in higher adherence (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74). There was high quality evidence from another study that participants receiving mobile phone messaging support had a significantly higher likelihood of quitting smoking than those in a control group at 6 weeks (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.70) and at 12 weeks follow‐up (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.84). At 26 weeks, there was only a significant difference between groups if, for participants with missing data, the last known value was carried forward. There was very low quality evidence from one study that mobile phone messaging interventions for self‐monitoring of healthy behaviours related to childhood weight control did not have a statistically significant effect on physical activity, consumption of sugar‐sweetened beverages or screen time. For the secondary outcome of acceptability, there was very low quality evidence from one study that user evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in adverse effects of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates. None of the studies reported the secondary outcomes of health service utilisation or costs of the intervention. Authors' conclusions We found very limited evidence that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may support preventive health care, to improve health status and health behaviour outcomes. However, because of the low number of participants in three of the included studies, combined with study limitations of risk of bias and lack of demonstrated causality, the evidence for these effects is of low to moderate quality. The evidence is of high quality only for interventions aimed at smoking cessation. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding the long‐term effects, risks and limitations of, and user satisfaction with, such interventions.","Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care Many costly and disabling conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or diabetes are linked by common preventable risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy nutrition, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use. However, prevention still plays a secondary role in many health systems as all too often, healthcare workers fail to seize interactions with patient as opportunities to inform them about health promotion and disease prevention strategies. This review examined whether mobile phone applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) can support and enhance primary preventive health interventions. There was moderate quality evidence from one study which showed that pregnant women who received supportive, informative text messages experienced higher satisfaction and confidence, and lower anxiety levels in the antenatal period than women who did not receive these. There was low quality evidence that there was no difference in pregnancy outcomes. We found one trial that provided high quality evidence that regular support messages sent by text message can help people to quit smoking, at least in the short‐term. One study assessing whether mobile phone messaging promoted use of preventive medication reported moderate quality evidence of higher self‐reported adherence by people receiving the messages. A fourth study on healthy behaviours in children found very low quality evidence showing that the interventions had no effect. There was very low quality evidence from one study that people's evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in harms of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates. There were no studies reporting outcomes related to health service utilisation or costs. Although we find that, overall, mobile phone messaging can be helpful for some aspects of preventive health care, much is not yet known about the long‐term effects or potential negative consequences.",CD007457
"Background Rehabilitation after ankle fracture can begin soon after the fracture has been treated, either surgically or non‐surgically, by the use of different types of immobilisation that allow early commencement of weight‐bearing or exercise. Alternatively, rehabilitation, including the use of physical or manual therapies, may start following the period of immobilisation. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. Objectives To assess the effects of rehabilitation interventions following conservative or surgical treatment of ankle fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Specialised Registers of the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group and the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field, CENTRAL via  The Cochrane Library  (2011 Issue 7), MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, AMED, SPORTDiscus and clinical trials registers up to July 2011. In addition, we searched reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials with adults undergoing any interventions for rehabilitation after ankle fracture were considered. The primary outcome was activity limitation. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, impairments and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for dichotomous variables, and mean differences or standardised mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous variables. End of treatment and end of follow‐up data were presented separately. For end of follow‐up data, short term follow‐up was defined as up to three months after randomisation, and long‐term follow‐up as greater than six months after randomisation. Meta‐analysis was performed where appropriate. Main results Thirty‐eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short‐term benefit of using an air‐stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone. Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in five of the eight studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain (number of participants with pain at the long term follow‐up: 10/35 versus 25/34; risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.68; 2 studies) and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies). During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight‐bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (mean difference in the difference in range of motion compared with the non‐fractured side at the long term follow‐up 6.17%, 95% CI 0.14 to 12.20; 2 studies). Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short‐term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. There was no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care. One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non‐thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight‐bearing and the use of a removable type of immobilisation to allow exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the use of a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential. There is little evidence for rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management and no evidence for stretching, manual therapy or exercise compared to usual care following the immobilisation period. Small, single studies showed that some electrotherapy modalities may be beneficial. More clinical trials that are well‐designed and adequately‐powered are required to strengthen current evidence.","Rehabilitation for ankle fractures in adults Ankle fracture is one of the most common fractures of the lower limb, especially in older women and young men. It is generally treated surgically or non‐surgically, followed by a period of immobilisation to prevent complications such as malunion. Because of the fracture and the subsequent immobilisation period, people often experience pain, stiffness, weakness and swelling at the ankle, and a reduced ability to participate in activities. This review looked at the evidence on the effects of different rehabilitation interventions for these fractures. Rehabilitation for ankle fracture can begin soon after the fracture has been treated, either surgically or non‐surgically, by the use of different types of immobilisation that allow early commencement of weight‐bearing or exercise. Alternatively, rehabilitation, including the use of physical or manual therapies, may start following the period of immobilisation. Thirty‐eight studies with a total of 1,896 participants were included in the review. Many of the trials were potentially biased. Three studies examined rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after non‐surgical treatment. There is some very limited evidence of short term benefit of one type of brace compared with immobilisation with a cast or orthosis. There was no evidence for hypnosis. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after surgical treatment. Ten of these compared the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise with cast immobilisation alone. There is some evidence from these that using a removable brace or splint so that gentle ankle exercises can be performed during the immobilisation period may enhance the return to normal activities, reduce pain and improve ankle movement. However, the incidence of adverse events (such as problems with the surgical wound) may also be increased. Starting walking early may also slightly improve ankle movement. One small and biased study showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short‐term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions that started after the immobilisation period. There is no evidence of improved function for stretching or manual therapy when either of these are added to an exercise programme, or for an exercise programme when this is compared with usual care. One small and potentially biased study found reduced ankle swelling after non‐thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy.",CD005595
"Background The proportion of proposed new treatments that are 'successful' is of ethical, scientific, and public importance. We investigated how often new, experimental treatments evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are superior to established treatments. Objectives Our main question was: ""On average how often are new treatments more effective, equally effective or less effective than established treatments?"" Additionally, we wanted to explain the observed results, i.e. whether the observed distribution of outcomes is consistent with the 'uncertainty requirement' for enrollment in RCTs. We also investigated the effect of choice of comparator (active versus no treatment/placebo) on the observed results. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR) 2010, Issue 1 in  The Cochrane Library  (searched 31 March 2010); MEDLINE Ovid 1950 to March Week 2 2010 (searched 24 March 2010); and EMBASE Ovid 1980 to 2010 Week 11 (searched 24 March 2010). Selection criteria Cohorts of studies were eligible for the analysis if they met all of the following criteria: (i) consecutive series of RCTs, (ii) registered at or before study onset, and (iii) compared new against established treatments in humans. Data collection and analysis RCTs from four cohorts of RCTs met all inclusion criteria and provided data from 743 RCTs involving 297,744 patients. All four cohorts consisted of publicly funded trials. Two cohorts involved evaluations of new treatments in cancer, one in neurological disorders, and one for mixed types of diseases. We employed kernel density estimation, meta‐analysis and meta‐regression to assess the probability of new treatments being superior to established treatments in their effect on primary outcomes and overall survival. Main results The distribution of effects seen was generally symmetrical in the size of difference between new versus established treatments. Meta‐analytic pooling indicated that, on average, new treatments were slightly more favorable both in terms of their effect on reducing the primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)/odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 99% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95) and improving overall survival (HR 0.95, 99% CI 0.92 to 0.98). No heterogeneity was observed in the analysis based on primary outcomes or overall survival (I 2  = 0%). Kernel density analysis was consistent with the meta‐analysis, but showed a fairly symmetrical distribution of new versus established treatments indicating unpredictability in the results. This was consistent with the interpretation that new treatments are only slightly superior to established treatments when tested in RCTs. Additionally, meta‐regression demonstrated that results have remained stable over time and that the success rate of new treatments has not changed over the last half century of clinical trials. The results were not significantly affected by the choice of comparator (active versus placebo/no therapy). Authors' conclusions Society can expect that slightly more than half of new experimental treatments will prove to be better than established treatments when tested in RCTs, but few will be substantially better. This is an important finding for patients (as they contemplate participation in RCTs), researchers (as they plan design of the new trials), and funders (as they assess the 'return on investment'). Although we provide the current best evidence on the question of expected 'success rate' of new versus established treatments consistent with a priori theoretical predictions reflective of 'uncertainty or equipoise hypothesis', it should be noted that our sample represents less than 1% of all available randomized trials; therefore, one should exercise the appropriate caution in interpretation of our findings. In addition, our conclusion applies to publicly funded trials only, as we did not include studies funded by commercial sponsors in our analysis.","New treatments versus established treatments in randomized trials Random allocation to different groups to compare the effects of treatments is used in fair tests to find out which among the treatment options is preferable. Random allocation is only ethical, however, if there is genuine uncertainty about which of the treatment options is preferable. If a patient or their healthcare provider is certain which of the treatments being compared is preferable they should not agree to random allocation, because this would involve the risk that they would be assigned to a treatment they believed to be inferior. Decisions about whether to participate in randomized trials are made more difficult because of the widespread belief that new treatments must inevitably be superior to existing (standard) treatments. Indeed, it is understandable that people hope that this will be the case. If this was actually so, however, the ethical precondition of uncertainty would often not apply. This Cochrane methodology review addresses this important question: ""What is the likelihood that new treatments being compared to established treatments in randomized trials will be shown to be superior?"" Four cohorts of consecutive, publicly funded, randomized trials, which altogether included 743 trials that enrolled 297,744 patients, met our inclusion criteria for this review. We found that, on average, new treatments were very slightly more likely to have favorable results than established treatments, both in terms of the primary outcomes targeted and overall survival. In other words, when new treatments are compared with established treatments in randomized trials we can expect slightly more than half will prove to be better, and slightly less than half will prove to be worse than established treatments. This conclusion applies to publicly funded trials as we did not include studies funded by commercial sponsors in our analysis.The results are consistent with the ethical preconditions for random allocation – when people are enrolled in randomized trials, the results cannot be predicted in advance as there is genuine uncertainty about which of the treatments being compared in randomized trials will prove to be superior.",MR000024
"Background There is a risk that people who have invasive urodynamic studies (cystometry) will develop urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine or blood. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics before or immediately after invasive cystometry or urodynamic studies is not without risks of adverse effects and emergence of resistant microbes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. The hypothesis was that administering prophylactic antibiotics reduces urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trial Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1966 to January 2009), PubMed (1 January 1980 to January 2009), LILACS (up to January 2009), TRIP database (up to January 2009), and the UK NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (searched 10 December 2009). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles, the primary trials and the proceedings of the International Urogynaecological Association International Continence Society and the American Urological Association for the years 1999 to 2009 to identify articles not captured by electronic searches. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria All randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in patients having urodynamic studies were selected. Two authors (PL and RF) independently performed the selection of trials for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data collection and analysis All assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were performed independently by two authors of the review (PL and RF) using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. We attempted to contact authors of the included trials for any missing data. Data were extracted on characteristics of the study participants including details of previously administered treatments, interventions used, the methods used to measure infection and adverse events. Statistical analyses were performed according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Data from intention‐to‐treat analyses were used where available. For the dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined for meta‐analysis using the Mantel‐Haenszel method. The primary outcome was urinary tract infection. Heterogeneity was assessed by the P value and I 2  statistic. Main results Nine randomized controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients having urodynamic studies were identified and these included 973 patients in total; one study was an abstract. Two further trials were excluded from the review. The methods of the included trials were poorly described. The primary outcome in all trials was the rate of developing significant bacteriuria, defined as the presence of more than 100,000 bacteria per millilitre of a mid‐stream urine sample on culture and sensitivity testing. The other outcomes included pyrexia, haematuria, dysuria and adverse reactions to antibiotics. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics when compared to a placebo reduced the risk of significant bacteriuria (4% with antibiotics versus 12% without, risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.56) in both men and women. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics also reduced the risk of haematuria (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (40/201, 20% versus 59/214, 28%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03); or in the risk of fever (RR 5.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 28.16) or dysuria (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). Only two of 135 people had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. The number of patients needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent bacteriuria was 12.3. Amongst women, the number needed to treat to prevent bacteriuria was 13.4; while amongst men it was 9.1 (number needed to treat = 1/ absolute risk reduction). Authors' conclusions Prophylactic antibiotics did reduce the risk of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this effect reduced symptomatic urinary tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of fever, dysuria or adverse reactions. Potential benefits have to be weighed against clinical and financial implications, and the risk of adverse effects.","Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies Urodynamics is an invasive test which involves inserting a catheter into the bladder in order to help with diagnosis of bladder symptoms. It carries the risk of causing a urinary tract infection. We need to balance the risk of a urinary tract infection and the symptoms associated with such an infection (such as fever, pain passing urine) against the risk and cost of giving prophylactic antibiotics. Some people also pick up an increased number of bacteria in the urine but do not develop the signs of an infection (asymptomatic bacteriuria). We looked at the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infections and bacteriuria. We identified nine trials including 973 people. We found that people were less likely to have bacteria in their urine after urodynamic studies if they had antibiotics (4% versus 12%). While they did have fewer urinary tract infections (20% compared with 28% with no antibiotics), this did not reach statistical significance. There were too few adverse effects, such as fever, pain when passing urine or a reaction to the antibiotics, for the findings to be reliable. However, people were less likely to have blood in their urine with antibiotics. There was no information about other treatments which might help reduce infections, nor about different doses or types of antibiotics.",CD008224
"Background High‐dose or dose‐intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy often causes myelosuppression and severe neutropenia among cancer patients. Severe neutropenia accompanied by fever, named febrile neutropenia (FN), is the most serious manifestation of neutropenia usually requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. FN and neutropenia can lead to chemotherapy treatment delays or dose reductions, which potentially compromises the effectiveness of cancer treatment and prospects for a cure. Granulocyte‐macrophage (GM) and granulocyte colony‐stimulating factors (G‐CSFs) are administered during chemotherapy in order to prevent or reduce the incidence or the duration of FN and neutropenia. Objectives To assess the effect of prophylactic colony‐stimulating factors (CSFs) in reducing the incidence and duration of FN, and all‐cause and infection‐related mortality during chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR, International Health Technology Assessment, SOMED, AMED and BIOSIS up to 8 August 2011. We also searched three Chinese databases (VIP, CNKI, CBM), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and OpenGrey.eu up to August 2011. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CSFs (any dose) with placebo or no treatment in patients with breast cancer at any stage, at risk of developing FN while undergoing any type of chemotherapy. Data collection and analysis We used pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for binary outcomes. At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Trial authors were contacted for further details when information was unclear. Main results We included eight RCTs involving 2156 participants with different stages of breast cancer and chemotherapy regimens. The trials were carried out between 1995 and 2008 and judged as being at least at moderate risk of bias. The strength of the evidence was weak for the majority of outcomes, which was mostly because of the small numbers of evaluable patients, varying definitions, as well as unclear measurements of the trials' outcomes and uncertain influences of supportive treatments on them. In most trials, the chemotherapy regimens had a risk of FN that was below the threshold at which current guidelines recommend routine primary prophylaxis with CSFs. Using CSFs significantly reduced the proportion of patients with FN (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12) but there was substantial heterogeneity which can be explained by possible differential effects of G‐CSFs and GM‐CSFs and different definitions of FN. A significant reduction in early mortality was observed in CSF‐treated patients compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.77; NNTB 79). This finding was based on 23 fatal events in 2143 patients; wherein 19 of these 23 events occurred in one study and 17 events were attributed to progression of the disease by the study authors. For infection‐related mortality, there were no significant differences between CSF and control groups (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.29). In CSF‐treated patients, the risk for hospitalization was significantly reduced (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.30; NNTB 13), as well as the use of intravenous antibiotics (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.55; NNTB 18). The risks of severe neutropenia, infection or not maintaining the scheduled dose of chemotherapy did not differ between CSF‐treated and control groups. CSFs frequently led to bone pain (RR 5.88; 95% CI 2.54 to 13.60; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 3) and injection‐site reactions (RR 3.59; 95% CI 2.33 to 5.53; NNTH 3). Authors' conclusions In patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, CSFs have shown evidence of beneﬁt in the prevention of FN. There is evidence, though less reliable, of a decrease of all‐cause mortality during chemotherapy and a reduced need for hospital care. No reliable evidence was found for a reduction of infection‐related mortality, a higher dose intensity of chemotherapy with CSFs or diminished rates of severe neutropenia and infections. The majority of adverse events reported from CSF use were bone pain and injection‐site reactions but no conclusions could be drawn regarding late‐term side effects.","Prophylactic colony‐stimulating factors to prevent infectious complications in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy Patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy have an increased risk of infection mediated through a low number of protective white blood cells (neutropenia). Neutropenia is a common toxicity of many chemotherapy agents and is caused by the suppression of the bone marrow. The first sign of infection is usually a fever, which indicates a potentially life‐threatening condition if it occurs during severe neutropenia (febrile neutropenia (FN)). FN requires hospital care including the administration of intravenous antibiotics and possible delays in the continuation of chemotherapy. Colony‐stimulating factors (CSFs) are drugs administered during chemotherapy in order to prevent or reduce the incidence or duration of FN and neutropenia. This review included eight trials in which 2156 patients with breast cancer had randomly received CSFs or placebo or no treatment during chemotherapy. These trials were carried out between 1995 and 2008. Prophylactic treatment with CSFs significantly reduced the risk of developing FN by 73%. The estimated number of patients needed to be treated with CSFs in order to prevent one event of FN was 12. Although a significant decrease in mortality of all causes during chemotherapy and CSF therapy was noted, there was no reduction in infection‐related mortality. There was no significant effect observed that planned chemotherapy schedules could be better maintained if CSFs were administered or that the number of patients with neutropenia decreased with CSFs. Notably, CSFs significantly reduced the need for hospital care yet frequently caused short‐term adverse effects like bone pain and injection‐site reactions. There were several limitations in this analysis: only a few trials could be included, the number of patients was low in many of these trials, and disease stages and chemotherapy treatments varied considerably. Moreover, the trial authors defined their outcomes differently, making comparisons across studies difficult. Information on the primary and secondary outcomes could not be obtained from all trials and the overall reporting quality was low. Many studies were dated and hence the administration of CSFs did not comply with current recommendations. Overall, CSFs have shown moderate evidence of beneﬁt in the prevention of FN in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The evidence that the administration of CSFs could reduce early mortality of all causes was weak and substantiates the need of further studies. There was no reduction in risk of infection‐related mortality with CSF treatment.",CD007913
"Background In industrialised countries injuries (including burns, poisoning or drowning) are the leading cause of childhood death and steep social gradients exist in child injury mortality and morbidity. The majority of injuries in pre‐school children occur at home but there is little meta‐analytic evidence that child home safety interventions reduce injury rates or improve a range of safety practices, and little evidence on their effect by social group. Objectives We evaluated the effectiveness of home safety education, with or without the provision of low cost, discounted or free equipment (hereafter referred to as home safety interventions), in reducing child injury rates or increasing home safety practices and whether the effect varied by social group. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2009, Issue 2) in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S), CINAHL (EBSCO) and DARE (2009, Issue 2) in  The Cochrane Library . We also searched websites and conference proceedings and searched the bibliographies of relevant studies and previously published reviews. We contacted authors of included studies as well as relevant organisations. The most recent search for trials was May 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials and controlled before and after (CBA) studies where home safety education with or without the provision of safety equipment was provided to those aged 19 years and under, and which reported injury, safety practices or possession of safety equipment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We attempted to obtain individual participant level data (IPD) for all included studies and summary data and IPD were simultaneously combined in meta‐regressions by social and demographic variables. Pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for injuries which occurred during the studies, and pooled odds ratios were calculated for the uptake of safety equipment or safety practices, with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Ninety‐eight studies, involving 2,605,044 people, are included in this review. Fifty‐four studies involving 812,705 people were comparable enough to be included in at least one meta‐analysis. Thirty‐five (65%) studies were RCTs. Nineteen (35%) of the studies included in the meta‐analysis provided IPD. There was a lack of evidence that home safety interventions reduced rates of thermal injuries or poisoning. There was some evidence that interventions may reduce injury rates after adjusting CBA studies for baseline injury rates (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Greater reductions in injury rates were found for interventions delivered in the home (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91), and for those interventions not providing safety equipment (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92). Home safety interventions were effective in increasing the proportion of families with safe hot tap water temperatures (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.86), functional smoke alarms (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.52), a fire escape plan (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.77), storing medicines (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.84) and cleaning products (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.96) out of reach, having syrup of ipecac (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.50 to 7.44) or poison control centre numbers accessible (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.70 to 6.39), having fitted stair gates (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.17), and having socket covers on unused sockets (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.96). Interventions providing free, low cost or discounted safety equipment appeared to be more effective in improving some safety practices than those interventions not doing so. There was no consistent evidence that interventions were less effective in families whose children were at greater risk of injury. Authors' conclusions Home safety interventions most commonly provided as one‐to‐one, face‐to‐face education, especially with the provision of safety equipment, are effective in increasing a range of safety practices. There is some evidence that such interventions may reduce injury rates, particularly where interventions are provided at home. Conflicting findings regarding interventions providing safety equipment on safety practices and injury outcomes are likely to be explained by two large studies; one clinic‐based study provided equipment but did not reduce injury rates and one school‐based study did not provide equipment but did demonstrate a significant reduction in injury rates. There was no consistent evidence that home safety education, with or without the provision of safety equipment, was less effective in those participants at greater risk of injury. Further studies are still required to confirm these findings with respect to injury rates.","Home safety education and providing safety equipment for injury prevention Injuries are the leading cause of childhood death in industrialised countries. People living in disadvantaged circumstances are at greater risk of injury than those who are more advantaged. This review examined whether home safety education and providing safety equipment reduced injuries and increased safety behaviours and safety equipment use. It also looked at whether home safety education was more or less effective in disadvantaged families. The review authors found 98 studies involving 2,605,044 participants which reported many different safety behaviours, but relatively few studies included information on injuries. The authors found that home safety interventions provided in the home may reduce injury rates, but more research is needed to confirm this finding. The results often varied between studies but, overall, families who received home safety interventions were more likely to have a safe hot tap water temperature, a working smoke alarm, a fire escape plan, fitted stair gates, socket covers on unused sockets, syrup of ipecac, poison control centre numbers accessible, and to store medicines and cleaning products out of reach of children. The authors found that home safety education was equally effective in the families whose children were at greater risk of injury.",CD005014
"Background Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment for many malignant and non‐malignant haematological disorders. Graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD), a condition frequently occurring after HSCT, is the result of host tissues being attacked by donor immune cells. One strategy for the prevention of GVHD is the administration of anti‐thymocyte globulins (ATG), a set of polyclonal antibodies directed against a variety of immune cell epitopes, leading to immunosuppression and immunomodulation. Objectives To assess the effect of ATG used for the prevention of graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with regard to overall survival, incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, incidence of relapse, incidence of infectious complications, non‐relapse mortality, early mortality within 100 days of transplantation, progression‐free survival, quality of life and adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), trials registries and conference proceedings. The search was conducted in October 2010 and was updated in July 2011 and February 2012. We did not apply any language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of ATG on GVHD prophylaxis in adults suffering from haematological diseases and undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Treatment arms had to differ only in the addition of ATG to the standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts, extracted data and analysed the data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included in the meta‐analysis six RCTs which met the pre‐defined selection criteria, involving a total of 568 participants. Quality of data reporting was heterogeneous among these studies with a lack of detailed information in the early studies. The primary outcome of overall survival was not significantly changed by the addition of ATG for the prophylaxis of GVHD (harms ratio (HR) 0.88; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.15, P = 0.33). The incidence of treatment‐requiring or severe acute GVHD (grade II to IV) was significantly lower in patients who received ATG (risk ratio (RR) 0.68; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85, P = 0.009; number needed to treat (NNT) 8). Also, the incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade III to IV) was significantly reduced (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85, P = 0.0005; NNT 7) but comparable data were available for rabbit ATG only. However, pooled study results regarding the incidence of acute GVHD of all grades (I to IV) showed no significant benefit of ATG treatment (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.06, P = 0.20). Meta‐analysis of data regarding the incidence of overall chronic GVHD (both, limited and extensive) was not possible. Nevertheless, studies reporting on extensive chronic GVHD (only studies evaluating rabbit ATG) suggested a lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD whereas others that only reported on overall chronic GVHD did not show an advantage for ATG. Pooled results regarding the incidence of relapse were not significantly different (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.68, P = 0.56), as well as pooled results regarding non‐relapse mortality (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.24, P = 0.35). Due to the lack of comparable data, we could not perform meta‐analysis of data regarding the incidence of chronic GVHD, relapse‐related mortality, progression‐free survival, quality of life, adverse events and engraftment. Authors' conclusions Our systematic review suggests that the addition of ATG during allogeneic HSCT significantly reduces the incidence of severe grades (II to IV) of acute GvHD, whereas the incidence of overall acute GVHD (grades I to IV) was not significantly lowered. This indicates a reduction of the severity but not the incidence of acute GVHD. However, this effect did not lead to a significant improvement of overall survival, which may be due to the severe potential side effects of the consecutively increased immunosuppression. Furthermore, future research is needed to clarify the effect of ATG on the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD and consequently on all aspects of quality of life. From the currently available data, no recommendation on the general use of ATG in allogeneic HSCT can be supported. Therefore, a careful consideration of the use of ATG based on the patient's condition and the risk factors of the transplantation setting should be made.","Anti‐thymocyte globulins for the prevention of graft‐versus‐host disease in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation Allogeneic haematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic option for a variety of malignant and some non‐malignant haematological (blood‐related) diseases. For this therapy, blood stem cells are transferred from a healthy person who has compatible tissue markers, so‐called human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers, to a matched recipient. Even though the donor and the recipient are matched concerning these markers, immune cells that are part of the transferred cells ('the graft') are prone to recognise tissues of the recipient ('the host') as being to some extent incompatible or foreign, which then can induce inflammation ('graft‐versus‐host‐disease' or 'GVHD'). GVHD typically involves the skin, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. GVHD is divided into acute and chronic forms based on the clinical features and the time of occurrence after transplantation. In order to prevent this potentially life‐threatening condition, reactive immune cells can be depleted in the recipient by administering antibodies which are directed against them. These antibodies are called anti‐thymocyte globulins (ATG) and are derived from animals which were immunised with human thymocytes or T‐cells. Different types of ATG have been used for decades to decrease the occurrence and severity of GVHD but they bear the risk of severe side effects such as increased infection rates or the risk of disease relapse. Also, severe side effects such as allergic reactions or serum sickness with shortness of breath and fever, blood coagulation disturbances or liver failure can harm the patient during the infusion of ATG. So far, no systematic analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of ATG has been done. In this systematic review, we included six randomised controlled trials comprising 568 adult patients. In summary, we found evidence that the addition of ATG reduced the occurrence of only the severe forms (grade II to IV) of acute GVHD with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 8 concerning grade II to IV acute GVHD and a NNT of 7 concerning acute GVHD grade III to IV. This means that eight or seven patients have to be treated with ATG, respectively, in order to prevent one case of severe acute GVHD. However, neither overall survival nor the overall occurrence rate of acute GVHD was improved by the use of ATG. Moreover, we did not find a difference between ATG treated patients and those who did not receive ATG regarding relapse of the underlying disease or non‐relapse mortality. The effect of ATG on quality of life after stem cell transplantation, which would be an important issue, has not been evaluated in randomised studies so far.",CD009159
"Background Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in selected groups is now performed in England, the USA and Sweden. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter are generally considered for elective surgical repair. Patients with aneurysm diameters below or equal to 55 mm (termed 'small AAAs') are managed with aneurysm surveillance as there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend surgery in these cases. As more patients are screened, there will be an increasing number of small AAAs identified. There is interest in pharmaceutical interventions (for example angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antibiotics, beta‐blockers, statins) which could be given to such patients to delay or reverse aneurysm expansion and reduce the need for elective surgical repair. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatment on the expansion rate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. Search methods The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (May 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. The reference lists of articles retrieved by electronic searches were searched for additional citations. Selection criteria We selected randomised trials in which patients with small AAAs allocated to medical treatment with the intention of retarding aneurysm expansion were compared to patients allocated to a placebo treatment, alternative medical treatment, a different regimen of the same drug or imaging surveillance alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta‐analyses were used when heterogeneity was considered low. The two primary outcomes were the mean difference (MD) in aneurysm diameter and the odds ratio (OR) calculated to compare the number of individuals referred to AAA surgery in each group over the trial period. Main results Seven trials involving 1558 participants were included in this review; 457 were involved in four trials of antibiotic medication, and 1101 were involved in three trials of beta‐blocker medication. Five of the studies were rated at a high risk of bias. Individually, all of the included trials reported non‐significant differences in AAA expansion rates between their intervention and control groups. The two major drug groups were then analysed separately. For AAA expansion it was only possible to combine two of the antibiotic trials in a meta‐analysis. This demonstrated that roxithromycin had a small but significant protective effect (MD ‐0.86 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.57 to ‐0.14). When referral to AAA surgery was compared (including all four antibiotic trials in the meta‐analysis), non‐significantly fewer patients were referred in the intervention groups (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) than the control groups. When only the trials reporting actual elective surgery were included in a subgroup analysis, the result remained statistically non‐significant (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.42). For the beta‐blocker trials, when all were combined in a meta‐analysis, there was a very small, non‐significant protective effect for propranolol on AAA expansion (MD ‐0.08 mm; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.10), and non‐significantly fewer patients were referred to AAA surgery in the propranolol group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). Bronchospasm and shortness of breath were the main adverse effects from the beta‐blockers. In one trial the adverse effects were reportedly so severe that the trial was stopped early after two years. Authors' conclusions There is some limited evidence that antibiotic medication may have a slight protective effect in retarding the expansion rates of small AAAs. The quality of the evidence makes it unclear whether this translates into fewer referrals to AAA surgery, owing mainly to the small sample sizes of the studies. Antibiotics were generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Propranolol was poorly tolerated by patients in all of the beta‐blocker trials and demonstrated only minimal and non‐significant protective effects. Further research on beta‐blockers for AAA needs to consider the use of drugs other than propranolol. In general, there is surprisingly little high quality evidence on medical treatment for small AAAs, especially in relation to the use of newer beta‐blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins.","Drug treatment for small abdominal aortic aneurysms An aneurysm is an abnormal localised widening (dilatation) of an artery. The most common place for such a dilatation is the abdominal aorta. This is the main artery linking the heart to the lower limbs and the organs of the abdomen, and a dilatation here is termed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). About 4% of men over 55 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture, and rupture carries a high risk of death. To reduce the risks, screening programmes using ultrasound scanning have been introduced for selected groups in a number of countries. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm are then evaluated for elective aneurysm repair. For aneurysms at or below the 55 mm cut‐off, the current treatment is 'watchful waiting', where the aneurysm is repeatedly scanned over time to see if it is enlarging. This review aimed to identify medical treatments which could slow or even reverse aneurysm growth, and thus delay or avoid the need for elective surgery. We identified seven trials involving 1558 participants where the aneurysm diameters of patients randomised to receive medical treatment were compared to those participants given a control medication or surveillance imaging alone. Four trials studied the effects of antibiotics on slowing aneurysm growth, and showed a small protective effect. Three trials studied the effects of beta‐blockers, and demonstrated a very small protective effect. Notably, the beta‐blocker drugs were associated with a large number of adverse effects. It was unclear whether either drug type delayed referral to aneurysm surgery. The accuracy of the results was limited by the low number of participants (especially important when trying to detect small changes in aneurysm growth rates) and some potentially damaging biases.",CD009536
"Background Peanut allergy is one of the most common forms of food allergy encountered in clinical practice.  In most cases, it does not spontaneously resolve; furthermore, it is frequently implicated in acute life‐threatening reactions. The current management of peanut allergy centres on meticulous avoidance of peanuts and peanut‐containing foods. Allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy aims to induce desensitisation and then tolerance to peanut, and has the potential to revolutionise the management of peanut allergy. However, at present there is still considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness and safety of this approach. Objectives To establish the effectiveness and safety of OIT in people with IgE‐mediated peanut allergy who develop symptoms after peanut ingestion. Search methods We searched in the following databases: AMED, BIOSIS, CAB, CINAHL,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, Global Health, Google Scholar, IndMed, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, MEDLINE, PakMediNet and TRIP. We also searched registers of on‐going and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was January 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs or controlled clinical trials involving children or adults with clinical features indicative of IgE‐mediated peanut allergy treated with allergen‐specific OIT, compared with control group receiving either placebo or no treatment, were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked and reviewed titles and abstracts of identified studies and assessed risk of bias. The full text of potentially relevant trials was assessed. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers with disagreements resolved through discussion. Main results We found one small RCT, judged to be at low risk of bias, that enrolled 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with evidence of sensitisation to peanut and a clinical history of reaction to peanut within 60 minutes of exposure. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had a history of severe peanut anaphylaxis. Randomisation was in a 2:1 ratio resulting in 19 children being randomised to the intervention arm and nine to the placebo arm. Intervention arm children received OIT with peanut flour and control arm participants received placebo comprising of oat flour. The primary outcome was assessed using a double‐blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge (OFC) at approximately one year. No data were available on longer term outcomes beyond the OFC conducted at the end of the study. Because of adverse events, three patients withdrew from the intervention arm before the completion of the study. Therefore, only 16 participants received the full course of peanut OIT, whereas all nine patients receiving placebo completed the trial. The per‐protocol analysis found a significant increase in the threshold dose of peanut allergen required to trigger a reaction in those in the intervention arm with all 16 participants able to ingest the maximum cumulative dose of 5000 mg of peanut protein (which the authors equate as being equivalent to approximately 20 peanuts) without developing symptoms, whereas in the placebo group they were able to ingest a median cumulative dose of 280 mg (range: 0 to 1900 mg, P < 0.001) before experiencing symptoms.    Per‐protocol analyses also demonstrated that peanut OIT resulted in reductions in skin prick test size (P < 0.001), interleukin‐5 (P = 0.01), interleukin‐13 (P = 0.02) and an increase in peanut‐specific immunoglobulin G 4  (IgG 4 ) (P < 0.01). Children in the intervention arm experienced more adverse events during treatment than those in the placebo arm. In the initial day escalation phase, nine (47%) of the 19 participants initially enrolled in the OIT arm experienced clinically‐relevant adverse events which required treatment with H 1 ‐antihistamines, two of which required additional treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). Authors' conclusions The one small RCT we found showed that allergen‐specific peanut OIT can result in desensitisation in children, and that this is associated with evidence of underlying immune‐modulation. However, this treatment approach was associated with a substantial risk of adverse events, although the majority of these were mild.  In view of the risk of adverse events and the lack of evidence of long‐term benefits, allergen‐specific peanut OIT cannot currently be recommended as a treatment for the management of patients with IgE‐mediated peanut allergy.  Larger RCTs are needed to investigate the acceptability, long‐term effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of safer treatment regimens, particularly in relation to the induction of clinical and immunological tolerance.","Oral immunotherapy for the treatment of peanut allergy Allergy to peanut can result in potentially life‐threatening reactions and, on occasions, death. Unlike many other forms of food allergy, allergy to peanut is typically life‐long. There is currently no cure for peanut allergy and people with this allergy must constantly be careful to avoid accidentally eating peanut or peanut‐containing foods.  If a person with a peanut allergy accidentally ingests peanut, he or she may develop serious allergic reactions necessitating emergency treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). The overall goal of allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the risk of further reactions associated with exposure to peanuts. Most people who have reactions to peanut have an immediate type (also sometimes known as IgE‐mediated) reaction in which symptoms typically develop within minutes of exposure to peanut protein and it is for this group that allergen‐specific OIT is a potential treatment approach.  It is not considered suitable for those who experience more delayed (also sometimes known as non‐IgE mediated) reactions.  Treatment involves giving people with peanut allergy very small doses of peanut protein by mouth and gradually increasing the amount being administered (the build‐up phase). Once the desired dose has been achieved, this is followed by the patient taking the same dose of peanut every day for a set period of time (maintenance phase).  As giving doses of peanut to someone with a peanut allergy has the potential to introduce allergic reactions, participants' safety needs to be carefully monitored during studies of peanut OIT. We found one small trial undertaken in 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with confirmed peanut allergy. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had had severe anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may result in death) because of their peanut allergy. The authors randomised children to intervention or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Intervention arm children received peanut flour whereas control arm participants received oat flour. The 48‐week trial showed that treatment with peanut OIT enabled children receiving OIT to substantially increase the amount of peanut flour they ate in comparison with those in the placebo arm without having an allergic reaction.  However, almost half of the children (nine out of 19) receiving OIT had an allergic reaction due to the OIT which required antihistamines, and two had more serious reactions to the treatment which required adrenaline (epinephrine).  Although promising, based on the findings of this one small trial, we cannot recommend that peanut OIT be used routinely for people with peanut allergy. There is a need for further larger studies investigating safer OIT regimens and establishing the long‐term effectiveness of OIT after treatment is stopped.",CD009014
"Background Although conventional non‐pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta‐analyses where appropriate. Main results Thirty‐three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end‐stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure. Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Authors' conclusions Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high‐quality clinical trials are required.","Acupuncture for insomnia Although conventional non‐pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. This review was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in treating insomnia. Thirty‐three randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, involving 2293 participants. We considered all studies to have a high risk of bias. They were diverse in the types of participants, acupuncture treatments and sleep outcome measures used, which limited our ability to draw reliable conclusions. Currently there is a lack of high‐quality clinical evidence to inform us about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture.",CD005472
"Background Late trabeculectomy bleb leaks are a common complication after filtering glaucoma surgery. Although asymptomatic, late bleb leaks may lead to hypotony and are associated with bleb related infections. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for late trabeculectomy bleb leak. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised trials in which any treatments for eyes with late bleb leak (interventional and non‐interventional) were compared with each other. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors when additional information was needed. Main results The review included one multicentre trial based in the USA with 30 eyes of 30 participants. The trial compared two surgical procedures (conjunctival advancement and amniotic membrane transplant) to cover a filtering bleb leak. Conjunctival advancement has been shown to be more effective in sealing filtering bleb leaks. Authors' conclusions Although a variety of treatments have been proposed for bleb leaks, there is no evidence of their comparative effectiveness. The evidence in this review was provided by a single trial that compared two surgical procedures (conjunctival advancement and amniotic membrane transplant). The trial did show a superiority of conjunctival advancement, which was regarded as standard treatment, to amniotic membrane transplantation. There is a need for more randomised trials to validate the findings of this single trial and provide more information on the different types of interventions, especially non‐surgical treatments compared to surgical procedures. We recommend that any intervention should be compared to a standard procedure, which is to date conjunctival advancement.","Interventions for late trabeculectomy bleb leaks Trabeculectomy is an eye operation in which a drainage fistula is created in the wall of the eye to reduce intraocular pressure, which is the goal of treating glaucoma. The fluid drained from the eye forms a blister‐like reservoir called ""filtering bleb"" where the fluid from the eye is then absorbed. Extensive scarring of the subconjunctival tissue leads to failure of the operation, therefore, drugs that inhibit cell growth and scar formation are used. Sometimes these drugs lead to thin walled and avascular filtering blebs, which are prone to leaks and infections. Such late‐onset filtering blebs and associated infections are a dangerous and common complication after filtering glaucoma surgery. For late‐onset bleb leaks, various treatments ranging from antibiotic eye drops to surgical closure of the leak have been suggested. The aim of this review was to compare any interventions to treat bleb leaks with conservative treatment and different interventions with each other. The literature search for this review identified only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared two surgical techniques covering the leaking filtering bleb with different types of tissue. The two surgical techniques were (1) conjunctival advancement whereby the conjunctiva (tissue covering the sclera) is dissected and mobilised forward to cover the leaking area, and (2) amniotic membrane transplant. The amniotic membrane is a thin, transparent tissue covering the foetus in the womb that is obtained after birth. Based on these findings it cannot be decided which intervention for filtering bleb leaks is the best, and whether an intervention is necessary at all. The authors' opinion is that in persistent bleb leaks, and those associated with sight threatening conditions such as hypotony (i.e. very low pressure in the eye), conjunctival advancement is the most promising procedure.",CD006769
"Background Arthritis remains a relatively infrequent complication of cystic fibrosis, but is a cause of significant morbidity when it does occur. Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its treatment. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs for the management of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database handsearches of relevant journal and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 10 July 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and newer agents such as biologic disease modifying agents and monoclonal antibodies) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Data collection and analysis No relevant studies were identified. Main results No studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Although it is generally recognised that cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis can be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents may be needed. But when episodic symptoms progress to persistent disease, disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs may be needed to limit the course of the disease. It is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these drugs could be found. This systematic review has identified the need for a well‐designed adequately powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs for the management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. However, given the infrequency of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis and the range of symptoms and severity, randomised controlled trials may not be feasible and well‐designed non‐randomised observational studies may be more appropriate. Studies should also better define the two conditions.","The use of drugs to slow or stop progression of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can cause major problems when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these types of arthritis is not clear because of cystic fibrosis and its intense treatment. Some drugs can treat the symptoms of arthritis by reducing inflammation of the joints and relieving pain, but only disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs can stop or slow progression of the disease. We planned to report evidence from clinical trials which compared different disease‐modifying drugs compared with placebo (or dummy treatment), with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled trials of these treatments or any evidence from non‐randomised controlled trials. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled trial to look at the effects and the safety of using disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs to slow or stop the progression of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis.",CD007336
"Background Reporting of adverse clinical events is thought to be an effective method of improving the safety of healthcare. Underreporting of these adverse events is often said to occur with consequence of missing of opportunities to learn from these incidents. A clinical incident can be defined as any occurrence which is not consistent with the routine care of the patient or the routine operation of the institution. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions designed to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare settings. Search methods We searched the the following databases: Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (Web of Knowledge), Healthstar (OVID), INSPEC, DHSS‐DATA, SIGLE, ISI Conference Proceedings, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Science), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of interventions designed to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors assessed the eligibility of potentially relevant studies, extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies. Main results Four studies (one CBA and three ITS studies) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The CBA study showed a significant improvement in incident reporting rates after the introduction of the new reporting system. Just one of the ITS studies showed a statistically significant improved effectiveness of the new reporting system from nine months. The other two studies reported no statistically significant improvements. Authors' conclusions Because of the limitations of the studies it is not possible to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Anyone introducing a system into practice should give careful consideration to conducting an evaluation using a robust design.","Are interventions to improve clinical incidence reporting effective? A clinical incident is ""any occurrence which is not consistent with the routine care of the patient or the routine operation of a healthcare institution"". To prevent clinical incidents, it is important to promote a safety culture among clinicians, healthcare professionals and patients, but also to identify and learn more from errors in order to improve the care process and the organisational support within healthcare institutions. Therefore, it is important to review the effectiveness of incident reporting systems aimed at increasing the number of clinical incident reported by health professionals. We searched the scientific literature for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare. We found four studies using different types of designs and which had several methodological shortcomings. The studies used different interventions and their results are heterogeneous: in two studies there was a significant increase in the reporting rate of clinical incidents. The results of this review show that rigorous evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of intervention is lacking, so it is not possible to draw conclusions for clinical practice.",CD005609
"Background Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well‐being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo. Objectives The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2012),  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), Current Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to January 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data. Selection criteria Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen‐progestogen therapy, sequential estrogen‐progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period of 12 months. Incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma assessed by a biopsy at the end of treatment was a required outcome. Data on adherence to therapy, rates of additional interventions, and withdrawals owing to adverse events were also extracted. Data collection and analysis In this update, 46 studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The small numbers of studies in each comparison and the clinical heterogeneity precluded meta‐analysis for many outcomes. Main results Unopposed estrogen is associated with increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at all doses, and durations of therapy between one and three years. For women with a uterus the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with hormone therapy comprising low‐dose estrogen continuously combined with a minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is not significantly different from placebo at two years (1 mg NETA: OR 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 2.8; 1.5 mg MPA: no hyperplasia events). Authors' conclusions Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus should comprise both estrogen and progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.","Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with intact uterus Hormone therapy may be used to manage troublesome menopausal symptoms, but is currently recommended to be given at the lowest effective dose and regularly reviewed by a woman and her doctor. In women with an intact uterus hormone therapy comprising estrogen and progestogen is desirable to minimise the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which can develop into endometrial cancer. Low‐dose estrogen plus progestogen (minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) taken daily (continuously) appears to be safe for the endometrium. For women who had their last menstrual period less than one year ago low‐dose estrogen combined sequentially with 10 days of progestogen (1 mg norethisterone acetate) per month appears to be safe for the endometrium.",CD000402
"Background Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, which can lead to pain in the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, and numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. Splinting is usually offered to people with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the effectiveness and duration of the benefit of splinting for this condition remain unknown. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome with no treatment, placebo or another non‐surgical intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (10 January 2011), CENTRAL, NHSEED and DARE ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), AMED (January 1985 to January 2012), and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to January 2012), using no time limits. We searched the reference lists of all included trials and relevant reviews for further relevant studies. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing splinting with no treatment (or a placebo) or with other non‐surgical treatments were eligible for inclusion. We also included studies comparing one splint type or regimen versus another. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgical treatment. There were no language restrictions. We included all patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome unless they had undergone surgical release. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and performed data extraction. Two authors also independently performed the assessment of risk of bias. We calculated measures of effect as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported and statistical significance set at P < 0.05 for all outcome comparisons. Main results The review included 19 studies randomising 1190 participants with carpal tunnel syndrome. Two studies compared splinting with no treatment, five compared different splint designs, one compared different splint‐wearing regimens, seven compared splint delivered as a single intervention with another non‐surgical intervention, and five compared splint delivered alongside other non‐surgical interventions with another non‐surgical intervention. Only three studies reported concealing the allocation sequence, and only one reported blinding of participants. Three studies measured the primary outcome, short‐term overall improvement at three months or less. One low quality study with 80 wrists found that compared to no treatment, splints worn at night more than tripled the likelihood of reporting overall improvement at the end of four weeks of treatment (RR 3.86, 95% CI 2.29 to 6.51). However, the lack of patient blinding and unclear allocation concealment suggests this result should be interpreted with caution. A very low quality quasi‐randomised trial with 90 wrists found that wearing a neutral splint more than doubled the likelihood of reporting 'a lot or complete relief' at the end of two weeks of treatment compared with an extension splint (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.28). The third study which measured short‐term overall improvement did not report outcome data separately per group. Nine studies measured adverse effects of splinting and all found either no or few participants reporting discomfort or swelling due to splinting; however, the precision of all RRs was very low. Differences between groups in the secondary outcomes ‐ symptoms, function, and neurophysiologic parameters ‐ were most commonly small with 95% CIs incorporating effects in either direction. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is limited evidence that a splint worn at night is more effective than no treatment in the short term, but there is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of one splint design or wearing regimen over others, and of splint over other non‐surgical interventions for CTS. More research is needed on the long‐term effects of this intervention for CTS.","Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, which can lead to pain in the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, and numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. CTS is more common in women and older age groups. Many people undergo surgery to treat this condition, though sometimes other non‐surgical treatments, such as splinting, are offered. Splinting involves immobilisation of the wrist with a device that is worn over the wrist, which usually leaves the fingers and thumb free to move. We searched for study reports and found 19 randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials including 1190 participants overall that assessed the safety and benefit of splinting for people with CTS. The risk of bias of studies was low in some studies and unclear or high in others. One low quality study suggests that splinting at night leads to more overall improvement in the short term when compared to no treatment, but we cannot say from the evidence whether one splint design or wearing regimen is more effective than another, nor can we say that splinting is more effective than other non‐surgical interventions for CTS (for example exercises, oral steroids). Nine trials measured adverse effects of splinting and all found either no or few participants reported discomfort or swelling due to splinting. More research is needed to find out how effective and safe splinting is for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly in the long term.",CD010003
"Background Delayed neuronal death following a perinatal hypoxic insult is due partly to xanthine oxidase‐mediated production of cytotoxic free radicals. Evidence exists that allopurinol, a xanthine‐oxidase inhibitor, reduces delayed cell death in experimental models of perinatal asphyxia and in people with organ reperfusion injury. Objectives To determine the effect of allopurinol on mortality and morbidity in newborn infants with hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library , 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012), EMBASE (1980 to March 2012), CINAHL (1982 to March 2012), conference proceedings, and previous reviews. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared allopurinol administration versus placebo or no drug in newborn infants with hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors. Main results We included three trials in which a total of 114 infants participated. In one trial, participants were exclusively infants with severe encephalopathy. The other trials also included infants with mild and moderately severe encephalopathy. These studies were generally of good methodological quality, but were too small to exclude clinically important effects of allopurinol on mortality and morbidity. Meta‐analysis did not reveal a statistically significant difference in the risk of death (typical risk ratio 0.88; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.56 to 1.38; risk difference ‐0.04; 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.10) or a composite of death or severe neurodevelopmental disability (typical risk ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.08; risk difference ‐0.14; 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.04). Authors' conclusions The available data are not sufficient to determine whether allopurinol has clinically important benefits for newborn infants with hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy. Much larger trials are needed. Such trials could assess allopurinol as an adjunct to therapeutic hypothermia in infants with moderate and severe encephalopathy and should be designed to exclude important effects on mortality and adverse long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Allopurinol for preventing mortality and morbidity in newborn infants with hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy Newborn infants who have been deprived of oxygen before, during, or after delivery (perinatal asphyxia) are at high risk of dying or developing brain damage. Studies using animal models suggest that allopurinol (a drug commonly used for preventing gout) can reduce the level of brain damage following perinatal asphyxia. Three small randomised controlled trials that examined whether giving allopurinol to newborn infants following perinatal asphyxia affected their outcomes were identified. None of these trials provided any evidence of benefit. Larger trials are needed to exclude important effects on survival and disability.",CD006817
"Background Because of the association of prone positioning with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) it is recommended that young infants be placed on their backs (supine). However, the prone position may be a non‐invasive way of increasing oxygenation in participants with acute respiratory distress. Because of substantial differences in respiratory mechanics between adults and children and the risk of SIDS in young infants, a specific review of positioning for infants and young children with acute respiratory distress is warranted. Objectives To compare the effects of different body positions in hospitalised infants and children with acute respiratory distress. Search methods We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2004 to April 2012) and CINAHL (2004 to April 2012). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or pseudo‐RCTs comparing two or more positions in the management of infants and children hospitalised with acute respiratory distress. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from each study. We resolved differences by consensus or referral to a third review author. We analysed bivariate outcomes using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). We analysed continuous outcomes using a mean difference and 95% CI. We used a fixed‐effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, in which case we used a random‐effects model. Main results We extracted data from 53 studies. We included 24 studies with a total of 581 participants. Three studies used a parallel‐group, randomised design which compared prone and supine positions only. The remaining 21 studies used a randomised cross‐over design. These studies compared prone, supine, lateral, elevated and flat positions. Prone positioning was significantly more beneficial than supine positioning in terms of oxygen saturation (mean difference (MD) 1.97%, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.77), arterial oxygen (MD 6.24 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.20 to 10.28), episodes of hypoxaemia (MD ‐3.46, 95% CI ‐4.60 to ‐2.33) and thoracoabdominal synchrony (MD ‐30.76, 95% CI ‐41.39 to ‐20.14). No adverse effects were identified. There were no statistically significant differences between any other positions. As the majority of studies did not describe how possible biases were addressed, the potential for bias in these findings is unclear. Authors' conclusions The prone position was significantly superior to the supine position in terms of oxygenation. However, as most participants were ventilated preterm infants, the benefits of prone positioning may be most relevant to these infants. In addition, although placing infants and children in the prone position may improve respiratory function, the association of SIDS with prone positioning means that infants should only be placed in this position while under continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring.","Positioning for acute respiratory distress in hospitalised infants and children Acute respiratory distress is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalisation and death in infants and young children globally. When children with severe respiratory distress are put in hospital, treatment may include additional oxygen or assisted ventilation which may damage the lungs. Infants and children with respiratory distress placed in particular positions may be more comfortable, breathe more easily and have better outcomes. However, different positions may also increase the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore we searched the literature to identify controlled clinical trials comparing two or more body positions in the management of infants and children hospitalised with acute respiratory distress. We included 24 studies with a total of 581 participants. Lying on the front (the prone position) was better than lying on the back (the supine position) for oxygenating the blood but the difference was small. The increase in oxygen saturation on average increased by 2%. This finding was based on data from nine studies (195 children, 165 preterm and 95 ventilated) measuring this outcome. The rapid rate of breathing with respiratory distress was slightly lower in the prone position (on average four breaths/minute lower) based on six studies (100 infants aged up to one month, 59 ventilated). No adverse effects were identified. There were no obvious differences with other positions. As most of the 581 children in these studies were preterm babies (60%) and (70%) ventilated by machine, the benefits of prone positioning may be most relevant to these infants. ***It is important to remember that these children were hospitalised. Therefore, given the association of the prone position with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the prone position should  not  be used for children unless they are in hospital and their breathing is constantly monitored. As the majority of studies did not describe how possible biases in the design of the study were addressed, the potential for bias in these findings is unclear. Also the findings of this review are limited by the small number of participants in studies, changes in infants and children were only measured for short time periods and the small changes in oxygenation which were seen in this review are not as meaningful as other measures of illness and recovery. Only five studies looked at children older than one year and few studies compared positions other than prone and supine.",CD003645
"Background Non‐surgical treatment, including exercises and mobilisation, has been offered to people experiencing mild to moderate symptoms arising from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, the effectiveness and duration of benefit from exercises and mobilisation for this condition remain unknown. Objectives To review the efficacy and safety of exercise and mobilisation interventions compared with no treatment, a placebo or another non‐surgical intervention in people with CTS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register (10 January 2012), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to January 2012), and AMED (January 1985 to January 2012). Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing exercise or mobilisation interventions with no treatment, placebo or another non‐surgical intervention in people with CTS. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed searches and selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for primary and secondary outcomes of the review. We collected data on adverse events from included studies. Main results Sixteen studies randomising 741 participants with CTS were included in the review. Two compared a mobilisation regimen to a no treatment control, three compared one mobilisation intervention (for example carpal bone mobilisation) to another (for example soft tissue mobilisation), nine compared nerve mobilisation delivered as part of a multi‐component intervention to another non‐surgical intervention (for example splint or therapeutic ultrasound), and three compared a mobilisation intervention other than nerve mobilisation (for example yoga or chiropractic treatment) to another non‐surgical intervention. The risk of bias of the included studies was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only three explicitly reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed, and four reporting blinding of participants. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions delivered, outcomes measured and timing of outcome assessment, therefore, we were unable to pool results across studies. Only four studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short‐term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared to baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post‐treatment). However, of these, only three fully reported outcome data sufficient for inclusion in the review. One very low quality trial with 14 participants found that all participants receiving either neurodynamic mobilisation or carpal bone mobilisation and none in the no treatment group reported overall improvement (RR 15.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 220.92), though the precision of this effect estimate is very low. One low quality trial with 22 participants found that the chance of being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with treatment was 24% higher for participants receiving instrument‐assisted soft tissue mobilisation compared to standard soft tissue mobilisation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.75), though participants were not blinded and it was unclear if the allocation sequence was concealed. Another very low‐quality trial with 26 participants found that more CTS‐affected wrists receiving nerve gliding exercises plus splint plus activity modification had no pathologic finding on median and ulnar nerve distal sensory latency assessment at the end of treatment than wrists receiving splint plus activity modification alone (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.30). However, a unit of analysis error occurred in this trial, as the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS was not accounted for. Only two studies measured adverse effects, so more data are required before any firm conclusions on the safety of exercise and mobilisation interventions can be made. In general, the results of secondary outcomes of the review (short‐ and long‐term improvement in CTS symptoms, functional ability, health‐related quality of life, neurophysiologic parameters, and the need for surgery) for most comparisons had 95% CIs which incorporated effects in either direction. Authors' conclusions There is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for CTS. People with CTS who indicate a preference for exercise or mobilisation interventions should be informed of the limited evidence of effectiveness and safety of this intervention by their treatment provider. Until more high quality randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of various exercise and mobilisation interventions compared to other non‐surgical interventions are undertaken, the decision to provide this type of non‐surgical intervention to people with CTS should be based on the clinician's expertise in being able to deliver these treatments and patient's preferences.","Exercise and mobilisation interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, resulting in pain to the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. In advanced cases the muscles of the hand can become weak. The condition affects approximately three per cent of the population, more commonly women. While carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with surgery, people with mild to moderate symptoms are sometimes offered non‐surgical interventions such as exercises or mobilisation. Based on the 16 studies identified, there is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for improving symptoms, functional ability (for example hand grip strength), quality of life, and neurophysiologic parameters, and for minimising adverse effects and the need for surgery in people with carpal tunnel syndrome. More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of exercises and mobilisation for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, especially the sustainability and long‐term effects of this treatment.",CD009899
"Background Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of tissue that is morphologically and biologically similar to normal endometrium in locations outside the uterus. Surgical and hormonal treatment of endometriosis have unpleasant side effects and high rates of relapse. In China, treatment of endometriosis using Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is routine and considerable research into the role of CHM in alleviating pain, promoting fertility, and preventing relapse has taken place. This review is an update of a previous review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, issue No 3. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of CHM in alleviating endometriosis‐related pain and infertility. Search methods We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ) and the following English language electronic databases (from their inception to 31/10/2011): MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, and NLH. We also searched Chinese language electronic databases: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Sci & Tech Journals (VIP), Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), and Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving CHM versus placebo, biomedical treatment, another CHM intervention; or CHM plus biomedical treatment versus biomedical treatment were selected. Only trials with confirmed randomisation procedures and laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis were included. Data collection and analysis Risk of bias assessment, and data extraction and analysis were performed independently by three review authors. Data were combined for meta‐analysis using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data. A fixed‐effect statistical model was used, where appropriate. Data not suitable for meta‐analysis were presented as descriptive data. Main results Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Although both these trials described adequate methodology they were of limited quality. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment. There was no evidence of a significant difference in rates of symptomatic relief between CHM and gestrinone administered subsequent to laparoscopic surgery (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). There was no significant difference between the CHM and gestrinone groups with regard to the total pregnancy rate (69.6% versus 59.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.59, one RCT). CHM administered orally and then in conjunction with a herbal enema resulted in a greater proportion of women obtaining symptomatic relief than with danazol (RR 5.06, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.05; RR 5.63, 95% CI 1.47 to 21.54, respectively). Oral plus enema administration of CHM resulted in a greater reduction in average dysmenorrhoea pain scores than did danazol (mean difference (MD) ‐2.90, 95% CI ‐4.55 to ‐1.25).  For lumbosacral pain, rectal discomfort, or vaginal nodules tenderness, there was no significant difference between CHM and danazol. Overall, 100% of women in both studies showed some improvement in their symptoms. Women taking CHM had fewer side effects than those taking either gestrinone or danazol. Authors' conclusions Post‐surgical administration of CHM may have comparable benefits to gestrinone. Oral CHM may have a better overall treatment effect than danazol and it may be more effective in relieving dysmenorrhoea when used in conjunction with a CHM enema. CHM appears to have fewer side effects than either gestrinone or danazol. However, more rigorous research is required to accurately assess the potential role of CHM in treating endometriosis.","Chinese herbs for endometriosis Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition causing menstrual and pelvic pain. Treatment involves surgery and hormonal drugs, with potentially unpleasant side effects and high rates of reoccurrence of endometriosis. The two small studies in this review suggest that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be as effective as gestrinone and may be more effective than danazol in relieving endometriosis‐related pain, with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment. However, the two trials included in this review were small and of limited quality so these findings must be interpreted cautiously. Better quality randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate a possible role for CHM in the treatment of endometriosis.",CD006568
"Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in Issue 4, 2009. There is an ongoing debate about the indications for, and value of, adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery in women with early cervical cancer. Certain combinations of pathological risk factors are thought to represent sufficient risk for recurrence, that they justify the use of postoperative pelvic radiotherapy, though this has never been shown to improve overall survival, and use of more than one type of treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) increases the risks of side effects and complications. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant therapies (radiotherapy, chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, chemoradiation) after radical hysterectomy for early‐stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IB1, IB2 or IIA). Search methods For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2008. The Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to November 2008), EMBASE (1950 to November 2008). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. For this update, we extended the database searches to September 2011 and searched the MetaRegister for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared adjuvant therapies (radiotherapy, chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, or chemoradiation) with no radiotherapy or chemoradiation, in women with a confirmed histological diagnosis of early cervical cancer who had undergone radical hysterectomy and dissection of the pelvic lymph nodes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Information on grade 3 and 4 adverse events was collected from the trials. Results were pooled using random‐effects meta‐analyses. Main results Two RCTs, which compared adjuvant radiotherapy with no adjuvant radiotherapy, met the inclusion criteria; they randomised and assessed 397 women with stage IB cervical cancer. Meta‐analysis of these two RCTs indicated no significant difference in survival at 5 years between women who received radiation and those who received no further treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 2.4). However, women who received radiation had a significantly lower risk of disease progression at 5 years (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9). Although the risk of serious adverse events was consistently higher if women received radiotherapy rather than no further treatment, these increased risks were not statistically significant, probably because the rate of adverse events was low. Authors' conclusions We found evidence, of moderate quality, that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression compared with no further treatment, but little evidence that it might improve overall survival, in stage IB cervical cancer. The evidence on serious adverse events was equivocal.","Radiotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, after surgery for early‐stage cervical cancer At present, doctors are not sure whether women with early cervical cancer who have had their womb and pelvic lymph nodes removed should be given radiotherapy. If the woman has a combination of certain risk factors that put her at high risk of having a recurrence of her cancer, doctors often think that it would be a good idea to give her radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy has never been shown to improve overall survival for these women and the combination of surgery and radiotherapy increases the risk of side effects and complications. We searched for all the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed whether radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) could improve survival in these women. We found only two trials that compared the use of radiotherapy with no radiotherapy in women with early cervical cancer who had had their womb and pelvic lymph nodes removed and who were at risk of having a recurrence of their cancer. These two trials enrolled 397 women. When we combined the findings from these two trials, we found that, on average, women who received radiotherapy were between 40% and 90% less likely to have a relapse of their cancer within 5 years than women who did not. However, because of the low number of deaths in the trials, we could not confirm whether radiotherapy helped to prolong life: our best estimate was that, 5 years after treatment, women who received radiotherapy were about 20% more likely to be alive than those who did not, but this estimate may not be very accurate and women's actual prospects could be anywhere between being three times more likely to be alive and being 60% more likely to be dead. Although women who had radiotherapy tended to have more complications than women who did not, we could not be sure whether this was due to chance rather than the radiotherapy because few women reported complications. The main limitations of the review were that we did not find any trials that evaluated a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and that the two trials of radiotherapy gave very little information about side effects.",CD007583
"Background Cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions. They commonly affect people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) at all stages of the disease. To date, the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS has been largely empirical without any evidence from randomised controlled trials. Objectives To systematically assess the effect of interventions on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary endpoint or adverse event in people with ALS/MND. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information. Selection criteria We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy. Data collection and analysis All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction. Main results Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta‐analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L‐threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed.","Treatment for cramps in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease A cramp is a sudden, involuntary painful contraction of a muscle. Many people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), experience cramps during the course of the disease. These range from mild cramps that do not affect daily activities and sleep, through to very severe, painful cramps. Some medications that are used to treat cramps in people with no medical condition or with conditions other than ALS have been tested in ALS clinical trials. These medicines include vitamin E, creatine, quinidine, and gabapentin. Other medications such as quinine sulfate, magnesium, lioresal, dantrolene, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, and gabapentin have been used to treat cramps in people with ALS but their effectiveness is unknown. In 2006 and 2010 the US Food and Drugs Administration issued warnings concerning the use of quinine sulfate, which was the previously most widely prescribed medication for cramps in the US. This review sought to find out how effective medications and physical treatments for cramps are for people with ALS. The reviewers identified 20 randomised controlled trials in people with ALS comprising a total of 4789 participants. Only one trial, of the drug tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), directly investigated the effectiveness of an intervention for cramps. Thirteen randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps secondarily among other variables. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps as adverse events. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine and lithium. None of the 20 studies could demonstrate any benefit, but the studies were small. Current evidence on the treatment of cramps in ALS is lacking and more research is needed.",CD004157
"Background Fermented milk has been suggested to have a blood pressure lowering effect through increased content of proteins and peptides produced during the bacterial fermentation. Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease world wide and new blood pressure reducing lifestyle interventions, such as fermented milk, would be of great importance. Objectives To investigate whether fermented milk or similar products produced by lactobacilli fermentation of milk proteins has any blood pressure lowering effect in humans when compared to no treatment or placebo. Search methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), English language databases, including MEDLINE (1966—2011), EMBASE (1974—2011), Cochrane Complementary Medicine Trials Register, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985—2011), Food science and technology abstracts (1969—2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials; cross over and parallel studies evaluating the effect on blood pressure of fermented milk in humans with an intervention period of 4 weeks or longer. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted individually by two authors, afterwards agreement had to be obtained before imputation in the review. Main results A modest overall effect of fermented milk on SBP was found (MD ‐2.45; 95% CI ‐4.30 to ‐0.60), no effect was evident on DBP (MD ‐0.67; 95% CI ‐1.48, 0.14). Authors' conclusions The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure. Despite the positive effect on SBP the authors conclude, for several reasons, that fermented milk has no effect on blood pressure. The effect found was very modest and only on SBP, the included studies were very heterogeneous and several with weak methodology. Finally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses could not reproduce the antihypertensive effect. The results do not give notion to the use of fermented milk as treatment for hypertension or as a lifestyle intervention for pre‐hypertension nor would it influence population blood pressure.","Fermented milk for hypertension High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.",CD008118
"Background Benign paroxsymal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short‐lived episodes of vertigo associated with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology (ENT) clinics. BPPV of the posterior canal is a specific type of BPPV for which the Epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre is a verified treatment. A range of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre are used in clinical practice, including post‐Epley vestibular exercises and post‐Epley postural restrictions. Objectives To assess whether the various modifications of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV enhance its efficacy in clinical practice. Search methods We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 December 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre versus a standard Epley manoeuvre as a control in adults with posterior canal BPPV diagnosed with a positive Dix‐Hallpike test. Specific modifications sought were: application of vibration/oscillation to the mastoid region, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre and post‐treatment instructions relating to movement restriction. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and the third author reviewed and resolved any disagreement. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised data forms. All authors independently assessed the trials for risk of bias. Main results The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post‐Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post‐treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix‐Hallpike test as an outcome measure. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix‐Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix‐Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients. There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre. No adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post‐Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone. However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy. An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post‐treatment Dix‐Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer‐term follow‐up of patients.","Modifications of the Epley manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) Benign paroxsymal positional vertigo (BPPV) is caused by rapid changes in head position. The person feels they or their surroundings are moving or rotating. Common causes appear to be head trauma or types of ear infection. BPPV can be caused by particles in the semicircular canal of the inner ear that continue to move when the head has stopped moving. This causes a sensation of ongoing movement that conflicts with other sensory information. The Epley manoeuvre has been shown to improve the symptoms of BPPV. This is a procedure that moves the head and body in four different movements and is designed to remove the particles (causing the underlying problem) from the semicircular canals in the inner ear. A range of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre are now used in clinical practice, including applying vibration to the mastoid bone behind the ear during the manoeuvre, having a programme of balance exercises after the manoeuvre has been done, and placing restrictions on a patient's position (for example, not sleeping on the affected ear for a few days). There are also a number of different ways to do the manoeuvre. We included 11 studies in this review, with a total of 855 participants. Nine studies looked at post‐treatment postural restrictions (using a neck brace/head movement restrictions/instructions to sleep upright) following the Epley manoeuvre. There was a statistically significant difference found when these restrictions were compared to a control treatment of the Epley manoeuvre alone. Although there was a difference between the groups, adding postural restrictions conferred only a small additional benefit since the Epley manoeuvre was effective alone in just under 80% of patients. Four of the studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV (a subtype of BPPV which is similar to posterior canal BPPV, but has some distinct differences in terms of the signs and symptoms), dizziness and disequilibrium (the feeling of unsteadiness on ones feet) in some patients. Additionally, two studies looked into the application of oscillation/vibration to the mastoid region during the Epley manoeuvre compared to control; the intervention produced no difference in outcome between these groups. One study that also researched post‐treatment postural restrictions looked into extra steps in the Epley manoeuvre. Compared to the control treatment there were no significant differences in outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies in the review. The results should be interpreted carefully and further trials are needed.",CD008675
"Background A large body of research has focused on investigating the effects of healthcare provider volume and specialization on patient outcomes including outcomes of colorectal cancer surgery. However there is conflicting evidence about the role of such healthcare provider characteristics in the management of colorectal cancer. Objectives To examine the available literature for the effects of hospital volume, surgeon caseload and specialization on the outcomes of colorectal, colon and rectal cancer surgery. Search methods We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and LILACS using free text search words (as well as MESH‐terms). We also searched Medline (January 1990‐September 2011), Embase (January 1990‐September 2011) and registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Non‐randomised and observational studies that compared outcomes for colorectal cancer, colon cancer and rectal cancer surgery (overall 5‐year survival, five year disease specific survival, operative mortality, 5‐year local recurrence rate, anastomotic leak rate, permanent stoma rate and abdominoperineal excision of the rectum rate) between high volume/specialist hospitals and surgeons and low volume/specialist hospitals and surgeons. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. Results were pooled using the random effects model in unadjusted and case‐mix adjusted meta‐analyses. Main results Overall five year survival was significantly improved for patients with colorectal cancer treated in high‐volume hospitals (HR=0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96), by high‐volume surgeons (HR=0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.93) and colorectal specialists (HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94). Operative mortality was significantly better for high‐volume surgeons (OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91) and specialists (OR=0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.91), but there was no significant association with higher hospital caseload (OR=0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04) when only case‐mix adjusted studies were included. There were differences in the effects of caseload depending on the level of case‐mix adjustment and also whether the studies originated in the US or in other countries. For rectal cancer, there was a significant association between high‐volume hospitals and improved 5‐year survival (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93), but not with operative mortality (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.33); surgeon caseload had no significant association with either 5‐year survival (HR=0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14) or operative mortality (OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19) when case‐mix adjusted studies were reviewed. Higher hospital volume was associated with significantly lower rates of permanent stomas (OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and APER (OR=0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.72). High‐volume surgeons and specialists also achieved lower rates of permanent stoma formation (0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.88) and (0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94, respectively). Authors' conclusions The results confirm clearly the presence of a volume‐outcome relationship in colorectal cancer surgery, based on hospital and surgeon caseload, and specialisation. The volume‐outcome relationship appears somewhat stronger for the individual surgeon than for the hospital; particularly for overall 5‐year survival and operative mortality, there were differences between US and non‐US data, suggesting provider variability at hospital level between different countries, making it imperative that every country or healthcare system must establish audit systems to guide changes in the service provision based on local data, and facilitate centralisation of services as required. Overall quality of the evidence was low as all included studies were observational by design. In addition there were discrepancies in the definitions of caseload and colorectal specialist. However ethical challenges associated with the conception of randomised controlled trials addressing the volume outcome relationship makes this the best available evidence.","Workload and surgeon´s speciality for outcome after colorectal cancer surgery There is some evidence to suggest better patient outcomes with increasing healthcare provider volume in complex cancer surgery. At present, healthcare providers are unsure of this relationship for colorectal cancer patients and there are mixed views on the concentration of such services to higher volume institutions. Some of the consequences of service centralization would include the loss of local healthcare provision for some patients, and the threat to financial viability of smaller hospitals often relying on a regular income from such a common condition. After thorough search of the available literature, we found fifty‐four observational studies (fifty one meta‐analysed) including 943,728 patients that addressed either the volume‐outcome relationship in the context of modern colorectal cancer treatment, or the effects of surgeon specialization. The results confirm the presence of a volume‐outcome relationship in colorectal cancer surgery, based on hospital and surgeon caseload, and benefits for specialization. For death within five years of treatment, hospital volume appeared to be more beneficial in rectal cancer surgery than for colon cancer. However, international differences in the data suggest provider variability at the hospital level between the different countries, making it imperative that every country or healthcare system must establish audit systems to guide changes in the service provision based on local data, and facilitate centralization of services as required. Overall quality of the evidence was low as all included studies were observational by design. In addition there were discrepancies in the definitions of caseload and colorectal specialist. However ethical challenges associated with the conception of randomised controlled trials addressing the volume outcome relationship makes this the best available evidence.",CD005391
"Background Oxygen therapy is widely used in the treatment of lung diseases. However, the effectiveness of oxygen therapy as a treatment for pneumonia is not well known. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of oxygen therapy in the treatment of pneumonia in adults older than 18 years. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2011, Issue 4, part of  The Cochrane Library,  www.thecochranelibrary.com (accessed 9 December 2011), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1948 to November week 3, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oxygen therapy for adults with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial (hospital‐acquired) pneumonia (HAP or NP) in intensive care units (ICU). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and assessed data for methodological quality. Main results Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The studies enrolled 151 participants with CAP or immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Overall, we found that non‐invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the ICU, odd ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.88; endotracheal intubation, OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; complications, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70; and shorten ICU length of stay, mean duration (MD) ‐3.28, 95% CI ‐5.41 to ‐1.61. Non‐invasive ventilation and standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask were similar when measuring mortality in hospital, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.68; two‐month survival, OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.28; duration of hospital stay, MD ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐2.05 to 0.05; and duration of mechanical ventilation, standard MD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.66 to 0.14. Some outcomes and complications of non‐invasive ventilation were varied according to different participant populations. We also found that some subgroups had a high level of heterogeneity when conducting pooled analyses. Authors' conclusions Non‐invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the ICU, endotracheal intubation, shorten ICU stay and length of intubation. Some outcomes and complications of non‐invasive ventilation were varied according to different participant populations. Other than the oxygen therapy, we must mention the importance of standard treatment by physicians. The evidence is weak and we did not include participants with pulmonary tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis. More RCTs are required to answer these clinical questions. However, the review indicates that non‐invasive ventilation may be more beneficial than standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask for pneumonia.","The effectiveness of oxygen for adult patients with pneumonia Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs. Treatment for pneumonia includes antibiotics, rest, fluids, management of complications and professional home care. Oxygen supplementation is one way to help patients who cannot breathe adequately on their own. Management of oxygen supplementation is divided into nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is life‐supporting ventilation that involves the use of a machine called a ventilator, or respirator. There are two main types of mechanical ventilation: non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive ventilation. The former provides ventilatory support to a patient through a tightly fitted facial or nasal mask and the latter through a tube inserted into the windpipe through the mouth or the nose or a hole made in the windpipe through the front of the throat. At present, oxygen therapy for individuals with pneumonia is commonly prescribed. However, inconsistent results on the effects of oxygen therapy on pneumonia have been reported and no systematic review has been conducted in patients with pneumonia to determine which delivery system of oxygen therapy leads to the best clinical outcomes. We searched the related literature and included three randomised controlled trials involving 151 adults with pneumonia aged around 60 years. We did not include patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis. We found that NIV can reduce the risk of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the need for endotracheal intubation, shorten ICU stay and length of intubation. Some outcomes and complications of oxygen therapy depended upon the delivery system and primary diseases. The most common complications of invasive ventilation are ventilator‐associated pneumonia. However, we must be aware that oxygen therapy is just one of the treatments for pneumonia and the other standard treatments used by physicians are of equal importance. The evidence is weak and it is limited by the small number of studies and the small number of study participants.",CD006607
"Background Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide‐reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Intranasal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting, although it is primarily absorbed in the gut, not the nasal mucosa. Objectives To determine the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults. Search methods We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011. Selection criteria We included randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐ and/or active‐controlled studies using intranasal sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment. Main results Twelve studies (4755 participants) compared intranasal sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 10 mg and 20 mg doses. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 10 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 7.3, 7.4, and 5.5 for pain‐free at two hours, and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. For sumatriptan 20 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 4.7, 4.9, and 3.5, respectively, for the same outcomes. The 20 mg dose was significantly better than the 10 mg dose for each of these three primary efficacy outcomes. Relief of headache‐associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than placebo. Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to two studies, one comparing sumatriptan 20 mg and dihydroergotamine (DHE) 1 mg, and one comparing sumatriptan 20 mg with rizatriptan 10 mg. Authors' conclusions Intranasal sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events compared with placebo.","Sumatriptan (intranasal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It is available as a nasal spray, and this route of administration may be preferable for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting, although absorption of the drug occurs primarily in the gut rather than the nasal mucosa. This review found that a single intranasal dose was effective in relieving migraine headache pain and associated symptoms of nausea, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in approximately 2 in 10 people (24%) taking sumatriptan 10 mg, compared with about 1 in 10 (10%) taking placebo. Pain was reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in 5 in 10 people (50%) taking sumatriptan 10 mg, compared with approximately 3 in 10 (32%) taking placebo. In addition to relieving headache pain, sumatriptan also relieved symptoms of nausea and sensitivity to light and sound by two hours in about half of those who took it, compared with about one‐third of those who took placebo. The 20 mg dose had greater efficacy, but may be associated with more adverse events, most of which were of short duration and mild or moderate in severity.",CD009663
"Background Functional analysis (FA) for the management of challenging behaviour is a promising behavioural intervention that involves exploring the meaning or purpose of an individual’s behaviour. It extends the ‘ABC’ approach of behavioural analysis, to overcome the restriction of having to derive a single explanatory hypothesis for the person’s behaviour. It is seen as a first line alternative to traditional pharmacological management for agitation and aggression. FA typically requires the therapist to develop and evaluate hypotheses‐driven strategies that aid family and staff caregivers to reduce or resolve a person’s distress and its associated behavioural manifestations. Objectives To assess the effects of functional analysis‐based interventions for people with dementia (and their caregivers) living in their own home or in other settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 3 March 2011 using the terms: FA, behaviour (intervention, management, modification), BPSD, psychosocial and Dementia. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with reported behavioural outcomes that could be associated with functional analysis for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia. Data collection and analysis Four reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess trial quality, including bias. Meta‐analyses for reported incidence, frequency, severity of care recipient challenging behaviour and mood (primary outcomes) and caregiver reaction, burden and mood were performed. Details of adverse effects were noted. Main results Eighteen trials are included in the review. The majority were in family care settings. For fourteen studies, FA was just one aspect of a broad multi‐component programme of care. Assessing the effect of FA was compromised by ill‐defined protocols for the duration of component parts of these programmes (i.e. frequency of the intervention or actual time spent). Therefore, establishing the real effect of the FA component was not possible. Overall, positive effects were noted at post‐intervention for the frequency of reported challenging behaviour (but not for incidence or severity) and for caregiver reaction (but not burden or depression). These effects were not seen at follow‐up. Authors' conclusions The delivery of FA has been incorporated within wide ranging multi‐component programmes and study designs have varied according to setting ‐ i.e. family care, care homes and hospital, with surprisingly few studies located in care homes. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of multi‐component interventions, which utilise FA. Whilst functional analysis for challenging behaviour in dementia care shows promise, it is too early to draw conclusions about its efficacy.","Inconclusive, but promising evidence for the efficacy of functional analysis interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia The management of challenging behaviour, such as aggression and agitation in dementia has been dominated by drug therapies such as the antipsychotics, despite their modest efficacy, side effects and potential detriment to quality of life. Functional analysis (FA) is a behavioural intervention that is described by international guidelines as the first line alternative to drug therapy for challenging behaviour. FA typically requires the therapist to develop an understanding of the function or meaning behind the person’s distressed behaviour. It uses this understanding to develop individually tailored strategies aimed at both the person with dementia and the caregivers, to relieve the distress caused by the behaviour. FA can be applied in home settings where the family or informal caregiver is offered support from a therapist, or in care homes, hospitals or assisted living settings, where training in FA and specialist support to deliver interventions is provided for staff.  In this review we analysed the effectiveness of functional analysis‐based interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia. We found eighteen randomised controlled trials suitable for analysis in all four types of care settings. The majority were in family care settings and there were surprisingly few care home based studies. Most evaluated broad programmes of care, where FA was just one component of a wide range of other interventions. This made it hard to determine the real effect of FA for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.  However, positive results were noted in the frequency of the person’s reported problem behaviours and the caregiver’s reaction to them. No significant effects were found for incidence or severity of mood and other problem behaviours. Similarly, no significant effects were found for caregiver mood or burden. Whilst it is too early to reach a firm conclusion on the evidence for FA in the management of challenging behaviour in dementia, we note emerging beneficial effects on challenging behaviour where multi‐component psychosocial interventions have used FA as part of the programme of care.",CD006929
"Background Many strategies are in use with the intention of preventing or minimising delayed onset muscle soreness and fatigue after exercise. Cold‐water immersion, in water temperatures of less than 15°C, is currently one of the most popular interventional strategies used after exercise. Objectives To determine the effects of cold‐water immersion in the management of muscle soreness after exercise. Search methods In February 2010, we searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  (2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), British Nursing Index and archive (BNI), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched the reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings and contacted experts. In November 2011, we updated the searches of CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (up to November Week 3 2011), EMBASE (to 2011 Week 46) and CINAHL (to 28 November 2011) to check for more recent publications. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing the effect of using cold‐water immersion after exercise with: passive intervention (rest/no intervention), contrast immersion, warm‐water immersion, active recovery, compression, or a different duration/dosage of cold‐water immersion. Primary outcomes were pain (muscle soreness) or tenderness (pain on palpation), and subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms). Data collection and analysis Three authors independently evaluated study quality and extracted data. Some of the data were obtained following author correspondence or extracted from graphs in the trial reports. Where possible, data were pooled using the fixed‐effect model. Main results Seventeen small trials were included, involving a total of 366 participants. Study quality was low. The temperature, duration and frequency of cold‐water immersion varied between the different trials as did the exercises and settings. The majority of studies failed to report active surveillance of pre‐defined adverse events. Fourteen studies compared cold‐water immersion with passive intervention. Pooled results for muscle soreness showed statistically significant effects in favour of cold‐water immersion after exercise at 24 hour (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.55, 95% CI ‐0.84 to ‐0.27; 10 trials), 48 hour (SMD ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.35; 8 trials), 72 hour (SMD ‐0.93; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.51; 4 trials) and 96 hour (SMD ‐0.58; 95% CI ‐1.00 to ‐0.16; 5 trials) follow‐ups. These results were heterogeneous. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that studies using cross‐over designs or running based exercises showed significantly larger effects in favour of cold‐water immersion. Pooled results from two studies found cold‐water immersion groups had significantly lower ratings of fatigue (MD ‐1.70; 95% CI ‐2.49 to ‐0.90; 10 units scale, best to worst), and potentially improved ratings of physical recovery (MD 0.97; 95% CI ‐0.10 to 2.05; 10 units scale, worst to best) immediately after the end of cold‐water immersion. Five studies compared cold‐water with contrast immersion. Pooled data for pain showed no evidence of differences between the two groups at four follow‐up times (immediately, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment). Similar findings for pooled analyses at 24, 48 and 72 hour follow‐ups applied to the four studies comparing cold‐water with warm‐water immersion. Single trials only compared cold‐water immersion with respectively active recovery, compression and a second dose of cold‐water immersion at 24 hours. Authors' conclusions There was some evidence that cold‐water immersion reduces delayed onset muscle soreness after exercise compared with passive interventions involving rest or no intervention. There was insufficient evidence to conclude on other outcomes or for other comparisons. The majority of trials did not undertake active surveillance of pre‐defined adverse events. High quality, well reported research in this area is required.","Cold‐water immersion for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise Delayed onset muscle soreness commonly results after sports and exercise activity. Cold‐water immersion (CWI), which involves people immersing themselves in water at temperatures of less than 15°C, is sometimes used to manage muscle soreness after exercise and to speed up recovery time. Our review included 17 small trials, involving a total of 366 participants. Study quality was low. Fourteen trials compared cold‐water immersion applied after exercise with 'passive' treatment involving rest or no treatment. The temperature, duration and frequency of cold‐water immersion varied between the different trials as did the exercises and settings. There was some evidence that cold‐water immersion reduces muscle soreness at 24, 48, 72 and even at 96 hours after exercise compared with 'passive' treatment. Limited evidence from four trials indicated that participants considered that cold‐water immersion improved recovery/reduced fatigue immediately afterwards. Most of the trials did not consider complications relating to cold‐water immersion and so we cannot say whether these are a problem. There were only limited data available for other comparisons of cold‐water immersion versus warm or contrasting (alternative warm/cold) water immersion, light jogging, and compression stockings. None of these showed important differences between the interventions being compared. While the evidence shows that cold‐water immersion reduces delayed onset muscle soreness after exercise, the optimum method of cold‐water immersion and its safety are not clear.",CD008262
"Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, mostly relating to cardiovascular complications. The relevance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of DKD has been investigated in recent years, and it has been shown that inflammatory markers are higher in people with DKD compared with the wider population. Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor with favourable anti‐inflammatory effects and immunoregulatory properties. The anti‐inflammatory effects conferred by pentoxifylline may be beneficial in the management of DKD. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of pentoxifylline for treating people with DKD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (January 2012), CENTRAL (Issue 12, 2011), MEDLINE, EMBASE and four Chinese biomedical literature databases (CBM‐disc, 1979 to July 2009), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP, until July 2009), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, until July 2009) and WanFang database (until July 2009). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs studying the benefits and harms of pentoxifylline for DKD. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two authors. Meta‐analyses were performed when more than one study provided data on a comparable outcome in sufficiently similar patients. Results of dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Mean differences (MD) were calculated to assess the effects of treatment where outcomes were expressed on continuous scales, and standardised mean differences (SMD) calculated where different scales were used. Data was pooled using the random effects model. Adverse effects were assessed using descriptive techniques and where possible, risk differences (RD) with 95% CI. Main results We identified 17 studies that included a total of 991 participants with DKD which met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was low: 4/17 reported the method of randomisation, 13/17 did not; no study described the method of random allocation; 4/17 studies were considered to be at high risk of bias and 13/17 were considered to have unclear risk for incomplete outcome data reporting; 9/17 studies were at low risk bias and in 8/17 the risk of bias was unclear for selective outcome reporting. Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline significantly reduced serum creatinine (SCr) (MD ‐0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.17 to ‐0.03), albuminuria (SMD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐3.85 to ‐0.70) and overt proteinuria (MD ‐428.58 µg/min, 95% CI ‐661.65 to ‐195.50), but there was no difference in creatinine clearance (CrCl) (MD ‐5.18 mL/min, 95% CI ‐15.55 to 5.19). When compared with routine treatment alone, pentoxifylline did not significantly reduce SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.07) or blood pressure (systolic (SBP): MD ‐0.28 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐2.20 to 1.63; diastolic (DBP): MD ‐0.15 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐1.44 to 1.14), but did significantly reduce albuminuria (SMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.07) and proteinuria (MD 0.46 g/24 h, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.74). There was no significant difference in SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.08 to 0.07), albuminuria (MD ‐8.79 µg/min, 95% CI ‐27.18 to 9.59), proteinuria (MD ‐0.01 g/24 h, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01) or blood pressure (SBP: MD 1.46 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 3.50; DBP: MD 1.37 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 2.98) between pentoxifylline and the active comparator (captopril or clonidine/methyldopa) for patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. CrCl was significantly increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa (MD 10.90 mL/min, 95% CI ‐1.40 to 20.40) but not with captopril (MD 3.26 mL/min, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 7.59). No data were available on the incidence of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), time to ESKD, quality of life, or all‐cause mortality. The adverse events of pentoxifylline were mild; no serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions From the available evidence, pentoxifylline seems to offer some beneficial effects in renal function improvement and reduction in albuminuria and proteinuria, with no obvious serious adverse effects for patients with DKD. However, most studies were poorly reported, small, and methodologically flawed. Evidence to support the use of pentoxifylline for DKD was insufficient to develop recommendations for its use in this patient population. Rigorously designed, randomised, multicentre, large scale studies of pentoxifylline for DKD are needed to further assess its therapeutic effects.","Pentoxifylline for diabetic kidney disease Kidney disease develops in 25% to 40% of diabetic patients, usually 20 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. Approximately one third of those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) will progress to end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) and will require long‐term dialysis or possibly receive a kidney transplant. Many patients however may die from associated coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular causes before the onset of ESKD. Pentoxifylline has been described as offering properties that may be beneficial for patients with DKD. We reviewed 17 randomised controlled studies, enrolling 991 patients with DKD, which compared pentoxifylline with placebo, routine treatment or antihypertensive drugs. Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline significantly reduced serum creatinine (SCr), albuminuria, and overt proteinuria, but not creatinine clearance (CrCl). When compared with routine treatment alone, pentoxifylline did not reduce SCr or blood pressure, but did significantly reduce albuminuria and proteinuria. Compared to captopril or clonidine/methyldopa there was no significant difference in SCr, albuminuria, proteinuria or blood pressure for patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. CrCl was significantly increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa but not with captopril. No data were available on the incidence of ESKD, time to ESKD, quality of life, or all‐cause mortality. The adverse events of pentoxifylline were mild; no serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Pentoxifylline seemed to have some beneficial effects in improving kidney function and reducing albuminuria and proteinuria (which can indicate kidney health) for patients with DKD, and was not associated with any major adverse effects. However, the current evidence on the effects of pentoxifylline for patients with DKD was insufficient to formulate therapeutic recommendations. More large, high‐quality randomised studies are needed to better inform clinical decision making about the use pentoxifylline for patients with DKD.",CD006800
"Background Anaemia occurs in 68% to 77% of patients with advanced cancer, however, only a minority of patients who are admitted to a hospice receive a blood transfusion. It is unclear what the benefit of blood transfusion is in advanced cancer, who is most likely to respond and also for how long. Hence we conducted a systematic review to assess the use of blood transfusion in advanced cancer. Objectives To synthesise the existing clinical evidence and summarise knowledge gaps regarding blood transfusions for treating anaemia in patients with advanced cancer. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, ZETOC and CENTRAL in November 2011. In addition, we checked and citation‐tracked the reference lists of all relevant studies and reports. We contacted investigators who were known to be researching this area for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), before and after studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies in adults and children, reporting the outcome of blood transfusions in advanced cancer. Data collection and analysis Two independent (NP and AH) review authors extracted data and quality scored studies. There were insufficient data to carry out an analysis. Main results No RCTs were found. We identified 12 before and after studies which included 653 participants and showed a subjective response rate of 31% to 70%. Five studies specifically assessed response using a range of fatigue scales which indicated an early response post transfusion, which was beginning to wane by day 14. Similar results were found for breathlessness. Overall survival ranged from two to 293 days but there was a significant proportion of participants (23% to 35%) who died within two weeks of their transfusion. Authors' conclusions Higher‐quality studies are required to determine the effectiveness of blood transfusion at the end of life and, in particular, to determine which patients are most likely to respond and which are not, and the duration of any response. Potential harms of blood transfusion at the end of life (indicated by high 14‐day mortality) need to be distinguished from inappropriate transfusion in patients who are dying from advanced cancer.","Blood transfusion for anaemia in patients with advanced cancer Many patients admitted to a hospice are anaemic but only a small proportion receive a blood transfusion. Two of the main symptoms of anaemia are fatigue and breathlessness. This review aimed to identify whether blood transfusion was a useful treatment for patients with advanced cancer who were anaemic. We identified only 12 relevant studies but all were of low quality. They indicated that fatigue and breathlessness improved immediately after the transfusion but this began to wane after a period of two weeks. Of those receiving a transfusion, 31% to 70% had a transient benefit that lasted about two weeks.",CD009007
"Background In malaria endemic areas, pre‐school children are at high risk of severe and repeated malaria illness. One possible public health strategy, known as Intermittent Preventive Treatment in children (IPTc), is to treat all children for malaria at regular intervals during the transmission season, regardless of whether they are infected or not. Objectives To evaluate the effects of IPTc to prevent malaria in preschool children living in endemic areas with seasonal malaria transmission. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (July 2011), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011), EMBASE (1974 to July 2011), LILACS (1982 to July 2011),  m RCT (July 2011), and reference lists of identified trials. We also contacted researchers working in the field for unpublished and ongoing trials. Selection criteria Individually randomized and cluster‐randomized controlled trials of full therapeutic dose of antimalarial or antimalarial drug combinations given at regular intervals compared with placebo or no preventive treatment in children aged six years or less living in an area with seasonal malaria transmission. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Data were meta‐analysed and measures of effects (ie rate ratio, risk ratio and mean difference) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methods. Main results Seven trials (12,589 participants), including one cluster‐randomized trial, met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in West Africa, and six of seven trials were restricted to children aged less than 5 years. IPTc prevents approximately three quarters of all clinical malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.26; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.38; 9321 participants, six trials,  high quality evidence ), and a similar proportion of severe malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76; 5964 participants, two trials,  high quality evidence ). These effects remain present even where insecticide treated net (ITN) usage is high (two trials, 5964 participants,  high quality evidence ). IPTc probably produces a small reduction in all‐cause mortality consistent with the effect on severe malaria, but the trials were underpowered to reach statistical significance (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.39,  moderate quality  evidence). The effect on anaemia varied between studies, but the risk of moderately severe anaemia is probably lower with IPTc (risk ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 8805 participants, five trials,  moderate quality evidence ). Serious drug‐related adverse events, if they occur, are probably rare, with none reported in the six trials (9533 participants, six trials,  moderate quality  evidence). Amodiaquine plus sulphadoxine‐pyrimethamine is the most studied drug combination for seasonal chemoprevention. Although effective, it causes increased vomiting in this age‐group (risk ratio 2.78, 95% CI 2.31 to 3.35; two trials, 3544 participants,  high quality evidence ). When antimalarial IPTc was stopped, no rebound increase in malaria was observed in the three trials which continued follow‐up for one season after IPTc. Authors' conclusions In areas with seasonal malaria transmission, giving antimalarial drugs to preschool children (age < 6 years) as IPTc during the malaria transmission season markedly reduces episodes of clinical malaria, including severe malaria. This benefit occurs even in areas where insecticide treated net usage is high. 16 April 2019 Update pending Studies awaiting assessment The CIDG is currently examining a new search conducted up to 17 Jul, 2018 for potentially relevant studies. These studies have not yet been incorporated into this Cochrane Review.","Administering antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria in children during the malaria transmission season In areas where malaria is common, younger children have repeated episodes of malarial illness, which can sometimes be severe and life‐threatening. In areas where malaria is seasonal, a practical policy option is to give drugs to prevent malaria at regular intervals during the transmission season, regardless of wether the child has malaria symptoms or not. This is known as Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTc). The authors identified seven trials (12,589 participants); all were conducted in West Africa, and six of seven trials were restricted to children aged less than 5 years. The results show IPTc prevents three quarters of all malaria episodes, including severe episodes, and probably prevents some deaths. Several antimalarial drugs or combinations have been tried, and shown to be effective. The most studied is amodiaquine plus sulphadoxine‐pyrimethamine (AQ+SP). This combination probably doesn't have serious side effects but does cause vomiting in some children.",CD003756
"Background Even with optimal disease‐modifying treatment and good control of disease activity, persistent pain due to structural damage is common in people with inflammatory arthritis and therefore additional treatment for pain might be required. Because comorbidity is highly prevalent in people with inflammatory arthritis, it is important to consider comorbidities such as gastrointestinal or liver diseases in deciding upon optimal pharmacologic pain therapy. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological pain treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis who have gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities, or both. Search methods We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies, to June 2010. We also searched the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) conference abstracts (2007 to 2010) and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) were considered for inclusion, for the assessment of efficacy. For safety, we also considered single arm trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series, cohort and case‐control studies, and case series of 10 or more consecutive cases. Pain therapy comprised paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid‐like drugs (tramadol) and neuromodulators (antidepressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants). The study population comprised adults (≥ 18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis who had gastrointestinal or hepatic, or both, comorbid conditions. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function and quality of life. Studies that included a mixed population of inflammatory arthritis and other conditions were included only if results for inflammatory arthritis were reported separately. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results From 2869 identified articles only one single arm open trial fulfilled our inclusion criteria. This trial assessed the safety and efficacy of naproxen (dosage not specified) in 58 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal comorbidities for up to 52 weeks. Thirteen participants (22%) remained on gold therapy, four participants (10%) remained on hydroxychloroquine, 27 (47%) remained on corticosteroids, 12 (21%) remained on salicylates and all participants continued on antacids and a bland diet. The presence of faecal occult blood was reported in 1/58 participants tested between weeks 1 to 26 and 2/32 participants tested between weeks 27 to 52. Over the course of the study, seven participants (12.1%) withdrew due to adverse events but, of these, only two participants withdrew due to gastrointestinal side effects (abdominal pain n = 1, nausea n = 1) and no serious adverse events were reported. It was noteable that out of 14 studies excluded due to inclusion of a mixed population (osteoarthritis or other rheumatic conditions) or an intervention that was already withdrawn, five trials reported a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal events in patients with prior gastrointestinal events when treated with NSAIDs. Authors' conclusions On the basis of the current review, there is scant evidence to guide clinicians about how gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities should influence the choice of pain treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis. Based upon additional studies that included a mixed population of participants with a range of rheumatic conditions, NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory arthritis and a history of gastrointestinaI comorbidity as there is consistent evidence that they may be at increased risk.","Pain in patients with inflammatory arthritis and gastrointestinal or liver problems This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of pain relieving drugs for people with inflammatory arthritis plus stomach or gut disease, or liver disease. The review shows the following in people with inflammatory arthritis plus stomach or gut disease, such as hernia or stomach or intestinal ulcers or previous bleeding from the stomach or intestine, or patients with liver diseases such as hepatitis or fatty liver: ‐ We are uncertain if naproxen (Aleve®, Naprosyn®) produced more side effects in people with inflammatory arthiritis plus stomach or intestine disease, compared with people with inflammatory arthritis without stomach or intestine disease, because only a single study giving low quality evidence was available. ‐ No studies were found that looked at pain relief. ‐ No studies were found that looked at other pain‐relieving drugs. ‐ No studies were found in people with conditions other than rheumatoid arthritis. ‐ No studies were found in people with inflammatory arthritis plus liver disease. We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with high dose paracetamol include liver problems. Aspirin and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems. What is inflammatory arthritis and what is pain management Inflammatory arthritis is a group of diseases that includes rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and other types of spondyloarthritis. When you have inflammatory arthritis your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. In rheumatoid arthritis, the small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. In contrast, in ankylosing spondylitis the joints of the spine are the most affected. There is no cure for inflammatory arthritis at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen and COX‐2s (for example celecoxib) are used to decrease pain and swelling. Opioids, such as codeine‐containing Tylenol®, hydromorphone (Dilaudid®), oxycodone (Percocet®, Percodan®), morphine and the opioid‐like drug tramadol are powerful pain‐relieving substances. Other drugs have some pain‐relieving properties and can therefore be used to control pain. This is the case of the so‐called neuromodulators, such as antidepressants (for example fluoxetine, paroxetine, amitriptyline), anticonvulsants (for example gabapentine, pregabaline) or muscle relaxants (for example diazepam).",CD008951
"Background Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a common condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life characterised by urgency with or without urge incontinence, frequency and nocturia.  Intravesical botulinum toxin is being increasingly used to treat severe overactive bladder refractory to standard management.  An increasing body of literature is forming that supports this technique as effective, well tolerated, and safe.  This review is a substantial update of the 2007 review of the same title. Objectives The objective was to compare intravesical botulinum toxin with other treatments for neurogenic and idiopathic overactive bladder in adults. The hypothesis to be addressed were whether intravesical injection of botulinum toxin was better than placebo or no treatment; pharmacological and other non‐pharmacological interventions; whether higher doses of botulinum toxin were better than lower doses; whether botulinum toxin in combination with other treatments was better than other treatments alone; whether one formulation of botulinum toxin is better than another; and whether one injection technique was better than another. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 23 February 2010). The Register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. Additionally, all reference lists of selected trials and relevant review papers were searched. No limitations were placed on the searches. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of treatment for OAB in adults in which at least one management arm involved intravesical injection of botulinum toxin were included. Participants had either neurogenic OAB or idiopathic OAB with or without stress incontinence. Comparison interventions could include no intervention, placebo, lifestyle modification, bladder retraining, pharmacological treatments, surgery, bladder instillation techniques, neuromodulation, and different types, doses, and injection techniques of botulinum toxin. Data collection and analysis Binary outcomes were presented as relative risk and continuous outcomes by mean differences. Little data could be synthesised across studies due to differing study designs and outcome measures. Where applicable standard deviations were calculated from P values according to the formula described in section 7.7.3.3 of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data were tabulated where possible with results taken from trial reports where this was not possible. Where multiple publications were found, the reports were treated as a single source of data. Main results Nineteen studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria.  Most patients in the studies had neurogenic OAB, but some included patients with idiopathic OAB.  All studies demonstrated superiority of botulinum toxin to placebo.  Lower doses of botulinum toxin (100 to 150 U) appeared to have beneficial effects, but larger doses (300 U) may have been more effective and longer lasting, but with more side effects.  Suburothelial injection had comparable efficacy to intradetrusor injection. The effect of botulinum toxin may last for a number of months and is dependent upon dose and type of toxin used. Patients receiving repeated doses do not seem to become refractory to botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin appeared to have beneficial effects in OAB that quantitatively exceeded the effects of intravesical resiniferatoxin. Intravesical botulinum toxin appeared to be reasonably safe; however, one study was halted due to a perceived unacceptable rate of urinary retention.  Authors' conclusions Intravesical botulinum toxin appears to be an effective therapy for refractory OAB symptoms, but as yet little controlled trial data exist on benefits and safety compared with other interventions, or with placebo. Further robust data are required on long term outcomes, safety, and optimal dose of botulinum toxin for OAB.","Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder for overactive bladder syndrome in adults Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is being increasingly used to treat persistent overactive bladder (OAB). This is a disorder characterised by the sudden urge to pass urine with or without incontinence, a frequent need to pass urine, and waking to pass urine during the night. We explored the research relating to how effective and safe botulinum toxin injections into the bladder are, and what the best dose of botulinum toxin is, and what is the best way of injecting it into the bladder. We found that there were several comparative studies, but these involved a relatively small number of patients. There was evidence that botulinum toxin improves the symptoms of OAB. It was unclear what the best dose of botulinum toxin was. Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder appeared to give few side effects or complications, but there were no long‐term follow‐up studies, and there could be rare side effects that have not been discovered yet.",CD005493
"Background Oxcarbazepine, a keto derivative of the ‘mood stabiliser’ carbamazepine, may have efficacy in the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder. Potentially, it may offer pharmacokinetic advantages over carbamazepine. Objectives To review the efficacy and acceptability of oxcarbazepine compared to placebo and other agents in the treatment of acute bipolar episodes including mania, mixed episodes and depression. Search methods Electronic databases were searched up to 2 September 2011. Specialist journals and conference proceedings were handsearched. Authors, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted requesting information on published and unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared oxcarbazepine with placebo or alternative agents, where the stated intent of intervention was the acute treatment of bipolar affective disorder were sought. Participants with bipolar disorder of either sex and of all ages were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the original reports individually by two review authors. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). Main results Seven studies were included in the analysis (368 participants in total). All were on mania, hypomania, mixed episodes or rapid‐cycling disorder. Overall, their methodological quality was relatively low. There was no difference in the primary outcome analysis – a fall of  50% or more on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) ‐ between oxcarbazepine and placebo (N=1, n=110, OR =2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.73) in one study, conducted in children; no studies were available in adult participants. In comparison with other mood stabilisers, there was no difference between oxcarbazepine and valproate as an antimanic agent using the primary outcome (50% or more fall in YMRS, OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.97, 1 study, n=60, P=0.273) or the secondary outcome measure (differences in YMRS between the two groups, SMD=0.18, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.59, 2 studies, n=90, P=0.40). No primary or secondary efficacy outcome measures were found comparing oxcarbazepine with lithium monotherapy. As an adjunctive treatment to lithium, oxcarbazepine reduced depression rating scale scores more than carbamazepine in a group of manic participants on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (SMD=‐ 1.12, 95% CI ‐1.71 to ‐0.53, 1 study, n=52, P=0.0002) and on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (SMD=‐ 0.77, 95% CI ‐1.35 to ‐0.20, 1 study, n=52, P=0.008). There was a higher incidence of adverse effects, particularly neuropsychiatric, in participants randomised to oxcarbazepine compared to those on placebo (1 study, n=115, 17% to 39% of participants on oxcarbazepine had at least one such event compared to 7% to 10% on placebo).There was no difference in adverse events rates between oxcarbazepine and other mood stabilisers or haloperidol. Authors' conclusions Currently, there are insufficient trials of adequate methodological quality on oxcarbazepine in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder to inform us on its efficacy and acceptability. Studies predominantly examine the treatment of mania: there are data from subgroup analysis on mixed affective, hypomania and rapid‐cycling states. From the few studies included in this review, oxcarbazepine did not differ in efficacy compared to placebo in children and adolescents. It did not differ from other active agents in adults. It may have a poorer tolerability profile compared to placebo. No data were found on outcomes relevant to patients and clinicians, such as length of hospital admission.   There is a need for adequately powered randomised controlled trials of good methodological quality to inform us of the therapeutic potential of oxcarbazepine across the spectrum of acute episodes in bipolar disorder.","Oxcarbazepine for acute affective episodes of bipolar disorder People with bipolar disorder suffer from repeated episodes of severe mood disturbance. These can vary from mania to severe depression.  Sometimes manic and depressive symptoms can occur at the same time. Episodes may also fluctuate frequently, so‐called 'rapid‐cycling'. Periods of normal mood and function may occur in between these episodes, but this is not always the case. Medications are used to treat these mood episodes and to prevent their recurrence. Oxcarbazepine could be one such medication. Currently, it is only licensed for the treatment of epilepsy. In this review we found seven studies that were eligible for inclusion, of which four studies compared the efficacy of oxcarbazepine to placebo or to other medications used in treating mania. While there was no evidence that oxcarbazepine worked better compared to a placebo, it did have similar efficacy to more accepted medications for the treatment of the illness. Two studies examined its acceptability to participants. Oxcarbazepine may cause more side effects than placebo. No differences in side effects were found between oxcarbazepine and other active medications. All the studies examined mania, hypomania, mixed episodes or rapid‐cycling disorder. More studies of better methodological quality are needed if we are to be certain whether oxcarbazepine works or not when treating mania, mixed episodes, depression and rapid‐cycling in bipolar disorder.",CD004857
"Background Following a hip fracture, traction may be applied to the injured limb before surgery. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1997, and previously updated in 2006. Objectives To evaluate the effects of traction applied to the injured limb prior to surgery for a fractured hip. Different methods of applying traction (skin or skeletal) were considered. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in  The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to April week 2 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 week 16), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 April 2011), conference proceedings, trials registries and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing either skin or skeletal traction with no traction, or skin with skeletal traction for patients with an acute hip fracture prior to surgery. Data collection and analysis At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from all trialists. Wherever appropriate and possible, data were pooled. Main results One new trial was included in this update. In all, 11 trials (six were randomised and five were quasi‐randomised), involving a total of 1654 predominantly elderly patients with hip fractures, are included in the review. Most trials were at risk of bias, particularly that resulting from inadequate allocation concealment, lack of assessor blinding and incomplete outcome assessment. Only very limited data pooling was possible. Ten trials compared predominantly skin traction with no traction. The available data provided no evidence of benefit from traction either in the relief of pain (pain soon after immobilisation (visual analogue score 0: none to 10: worst pain): mean difference 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.50; 3 trials), ease of fracture reduction or quality of fracture reduction at time of surgery. There were inconclusive data for pressures sores and other complications, including fracture fixation failure. Three minor adverse effects (sensory disturbance and skin blisters) related to skin traction were reported. One of the above trials included both skin and skeletal traction groups. This trial and one other compared skeletal traction with skin traction and found no important differences between these two methods, although the initial application of skeletal traction was noted as being more painful and more costly. Authors' conclusions From the evidence available, the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture does not appear to have any benefit. However, the evidence is also insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, or to confirm additional complications due to traction use. Given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre‐operative traction, the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre‐operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well‐designed randomised controlled trial.","The routine use of traction before surgery in adults with hip fracture For people with hip fractures, traction involves either using tapes (skin traction) or pins (skeletal traction) attached to the injured leg and connected to weights via a pulley. The application of traction before surgery is thought to relieve pain and make the subsequent surgery easier. Where traction is not used, the injured limb is usually placed on a pillow and the patient encouraged to adopt a position of greatest comfort. This review summarising the evidence from randomised controlled trials included 11 trials with 1654 participants. Consistent with the general hip fracture population, most of the trial participants were older persons of around 80 years of age and the majority were female. Ten trials compared traction versus no traction and two trials, including one of the preceding 10 trials, compared skin and skeletal traction. As well as limitations in the trial methods, there were very limited data for pooling and a lack of information about the longer‐term consequences of applying or not applying traction. Nonetheless, the evidence from the 10 trials consistently showed no evidence to support the supposed advantages of traction described above. There were inconclusive data for pressures sores (skin ulcers) and other complications. One trial reported three adverse effects (sensory disturbance and skin blisters) related to skin traction; all were minor.",CD000168
"Background In patients presenting for surgical resection of lesions involving, or adjacent to, the functionally important eloquent cortical areas, it is vital to achieve complete or near complete resection of the pathology without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues.The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned with are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. If the lesions are within these regions surgeons could either take a biopsy or do a intracapsular decompression without damaging the mentioned areas to avoid postoperative dysfunction. If the lesions are adjacent to the above mentioned areas, the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours. Intraoperative mapping of the cortex with stimulating and recording electrodes is termed as electrophysiological (EP) mapping.The EP mapping of motor, sensory and language cortex is widely employed in the resection of lesions involving or adjacent to the eloquent areas. Both intravenous and inhalational agents are known to affect these EP mapping techniques. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of anaesthetic agents on intra‐operative EP mapping in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures involving, or adjacent to, the functional areas of the cortex under general anaesthesia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (7 March 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL issue 1 of 4,  The Cochrane Library  2011), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1948 to February week 4, 2011), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 7 March 2011), and the National Research Register Archive and UK Clinical Research Network (7 March 2011). We also contacted other researchers in the field in an attempt to ascertain unpublished studies. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials irrespective of blinding in patients of any age or gender undergoing neurosurgery under general anaesthesia where cortical mapping was attempted to identify eloquent areas using either somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), or direct cortical stimulation (DCS) triggered muscle motor evoked potentials (mMEPs), or both.   We excluded patients from trials where the anaesthetic effects were evaluated during spinal cord surgery or where MEPs were recorded from modes other than direct cortical stimulation such as transcranial electrical stimulation (TcMEPs), MEPs derived from epidural electrodes (D waves) and magnetic stimulation and trials involving awake craniotomies or the asleep‐awake‐asleep technique during cortical mapping. Data collection and analysis Two review authors planned to independently apply the inclusion criteria and extract data. Main results No RCTs were found for this study population. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the need for well‐designed randomised controlled trials to assess the effect of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain.","The effects of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain There are discrete areas in the brain that are responsible for sensation (sensory), control of movement (motor) and language functions. In patients with surgically removable lesions involving, or adjacent to, these areas, it is important to achieve a near complete resection without damaging the functional areas (normal brain tissue). Electrical properties of the brain cells are often monitored during these surgical procedures to accurately identify the functional areas. This technique is called electrophysiological mapping. Anaesthetic agents are known to affect the mapping techniques. The authors of this review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTS) assessing the effect of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping of these functional areas of the brain. We were not able to find any RCTs. Good quality evidence is lacking and hence there is a need for well‐designed RCTs to determine the effects of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping in this specific surgical population.",CD006679
"Background Many adolescents receive mentoring. There is no systematic review if mentoring prevents alcohol and drug use. Objectives Assess effectiveness of mentoring to prevent adolescent alcohol/drug use. Search methods Cochrane CENTRAL (issue 4), MEDLINE (1950‐to July 2011), EMBASE (1980‐to July 2011), 5 other electronic and 11 Grey literature electronic databases, 10 websites, reference lists, experts in addictions and mentoring. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mentoring in adolescents to prevent alcohol/drug use. Data collection and analysis We identified 2,113 abstracts, independently assessed 233 full‐text articles, 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We contacted investigators for missing information. Main results We identified 4 RCTs (1,194 adolescents). No RCT reported enough detail to assess whether a strong  randomisation method was used or allocation was concealed. Blinding was not possible as the intervention was mentoring. Three RCTs provided complete data. No selective reporting. Three RCTs provided evidence about mentoring and preventing alcohol use. We pooled two RCTs (RR for mentoring compared to no intervention = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.90, P value = 0.005). A third RCT found no significant differences. Three RCTs provided evidence about mentoring and preventing drug use, but could not be pooled. One found significantly less use of “illegal"" drugs,"" one did not, and one assessed only marijuana use and found no significant differences. One RCT measured “substance use” without separating alcohol and drugs, and found no difference for mentoring. Authors' conclusions All four RCTs were in the US, and included “deprived” and mostly minority adolescents. Participants were young (in two studies age 12, and in two others 9‐16). All students at baseline were non‐users of alcohol and drugs. Two RCTs found mentoring reduced the rate of initiation of alcohol, and one of drug usage. The ability of the interventions to be effective was limited by the low rates of commencing alcohol and drug use during the intervention period in two studies (the use of marijuana in one study increased to 1% in the experimental and to 1.6% in the control group, and in another study drug usage rose to 6% in the experimental and 11% in the control group). However, in a third study there was scope for the intervention to have an effect as alcohol use rose to 19% in the experimental and 27% in the control group. The studies assessed structured programmes and not informal mentors.","Mentoring adolescents to prevent drug or alcohol use There are high rates of alcohol and drug use by many adolescents. Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. All four RCTs were in the US and with adolescents described as deprived, and most were minority group adolescents. Two RCTs tested the ""Across Ages"" mentoring programme, one the Big Brothers/Big Sisters mentoring programme, and one an intervention with adolescents whose parents were HIV+. Two RCTs found that mentoring reduced rates of initiation of use of alcohol, and one reduced initiation of use of drugs. No adverse effects were identified. The relative youth of three of the samples made it unlikely that the interventions would be effective due to low baseline rates of usage. The studies assessed formal programmes, and as most mentors are informal their work remains un assessed.",CD007381
"Background Human albumin solutions are used for a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, such as in burns and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids. Objectives To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 31 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to week 3 May 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 21 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) (1970 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S) (1990 to May 2011), PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/) (searched 10 June 2011, limit: last 60 days). Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin or PPF with no albumin or PPF or with a crystalloid solution in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia. Data collection and analysis We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type. Main results We found 38 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 1,958 deaths among 10,842 trial participants. For hypovolaemia, the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.13). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of the SAFE trial, which contributed 75.2% of the information (based on the weights in the meta‐analysis). For burns, the relative risk was 2.93 (95% CI 1.28 to 6.72) and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.88). There was no substantial heterogeneity between the trials in the various categories (Chi 2  = 26.66, df = 31, P = 0.69). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.16). Authors' conclusions For patients with hypovolaemia, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline. There is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with burns and hypoalbuminaemia. The possibility that there may be highly selected populations of critically ill patients in which albumin may be indicated remains open to question. However, in view of the absence of evidence of a mortality benefit from albumin and the increased cost of albumin compared to alternatives such as saline, it would seem reasonable that albumin should only be used within the context of well concealed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials.","What is the effect of giving human albumin compared to saline to replace lost blood in critically ill or injured people Trauma, burns or surgery can cause people to lose large amounts of blood. Fluid replacement, giving fluids intravenously (into a vein), is used to help restore blood volume and hopefully reduce the risk of dying. Blood products (including human albumin), non‐blood products or combinations can be used. This review of 38 trials found no evidence that albumin reduces the risk of dying. Albumin is very expensive, in which case it may be better to use cheaper alternatives such as saline for fluid replacement.",CD001208
"Background Rotavirus infection is the most common neonatal nosocomial viral infection. It is a major health problem worldwide. Epidemics with the newer P(6)G9 strains have been reported in neonatal units globally. These strains can cause severe symptoms in most infected infants. Infection control measures become necessary and the utilization of hospital resources increase. Local mucosal immunity in the intestine to rotavirus is important in the resolution of infection and protection against subsequent infections. Boosting local immunity by oral administration of anti‐rotaviral immunoglobulin preparations might be a useful strategy in treating rotaviral infections, especially in low birth weight babies. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of oral immunoglobulin preparations for the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in hospitalized low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 2500 g) Search methods Electronic databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, Biological Abstracts (BIOSIS) were searched by the strategy outlined in the protocol. Science Citation Index search for all articles that referenced Barnes 1982 were searched. The proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies published online at 'Abstracts Online' were searched. Ongoing registered trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled‐trials.com were searched. Authors prominent in the field were contacted for any unpublished articles and more information on published articles was sought. Reference lists of identified clinical trials and personal files were also reviewed. The above search was updated in July 2011. Selection criteria The criteria used to select studies for inclusion were:   1) Design: randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials   2) Hospitalized low birth weight infants with rotavirus diarrhea   3) Intervention: Oral immunoglobulin preparations compared to placebo or no intervention   4) At least one of the following outcomes were reported: All cause mortality during hospital stay, mortality due to rotavirus infection during hospital stay, duration of diarrhea, need for rehydration, duration of viral excretion, duration of infection control measures, length of hospital stay in days, recurrent diarrhea or chronic diarrhea Data collection and analysis The two reviewers were to independently abstract data from eligible trials. No data were available for analysis. Main results No eligible randomized controlled trials were found. Authors' conclusions No randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness or safety of oral immunoglobulin preparations for the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in hospitalized low birth weight infants were found. Clinical trials that address the issue of oral immunoglobulin treatment of rotavirus infection are needed.","Oral immunoglobulin for the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in low birth weight infants Rotavirus infection can cause significant problems including diarrhea in the newborn. This is particularly true in babies weighing less than 2500 g (low birth weight infants). Rotavirus infection is becoming more common in newborn babies and can spread from one baby to another in the neonatal unit. Administration of antibodies against rotavirus to babies may be one of the methods to treat this infection and to prevent the spread of infection in the neonatal unit. In this review, we did not identify any trial that used antibodies to treat rotavirus infection. More research is needed to address these issues.",CD003742
"Background Among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, early neonatal hyperglycemia is common and is associated with increased risks for death and major morbidities. It is uncertain whether hyperglycemia  per se  is a cause of adverse clinical outcomes or whether outcomes can be improved by preventing hyperglycemia. Objectives To assess effects on clinical outcomes of interventions for preventing hyperglycemia in VLBW neonates receiving full or partial parenteral nutrition. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, issue 4 of 12, 2011; MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011); EMBASE (1980 to April 2011); CINAHL (1982 to Nov 2008); abstracts of Pediatric Academic Societies 2000 to 2011 and European Society for Pediatric Research 2005 to 2010. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials of interventions for prevention of hyperglycemia in neonates with birth weight < 1500 g or gestational age < 32 wk. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for eligibility and extracted data on study design, methods, clinical features, and treatment outcomes. Included trials were assessed for blinding of randomization, intervention and outcome measurement, and completeness of follow‐up. Treatment effect measures for categorical outcomes were relative risk and risk difference, and for continuous outcomes, mean difference, each with their 95% confidence intervals. Main results We detected four eligible trials. Two trials compared lower versus higher rates of glucose infusion in the early postnatal period. These trials were too small to assess effects on mortality or major morbidities. Two trials, one a moderately large multicentre trial (NIRTURE, Beardsall 2008), compared insulin infusion with standard care. Insulin infusion reduced hyperglycemia but increased death before 28 days and hypoglycemia. Reduction in hyperglycemia was not accompanied by significant effects on major morbidities; effects on neurodevelopment are awaited. Authors' conclusions Glucose infusion rate: There is insufficient evidence from trials comparing lower with higher glucose infusion rates to inform clinical practice. Large randomized trials are needed, powered on clinical outcomes including death, major morbidities and adverse neurodevelopment. Insulin infusion: The evidence reviewed does not support the routine use of insulin infusions to prevent hyperglycemia in VLBW neonates. Further randomized trials of insulin infusion may be justified. They should enrol extremely low birth weight neonates at very high risk for hyperglycemia and neonatal death. They might use real time glucose monitors if these are validated for clinical use. Refinement of algorithms to guide insulin infusion is needed to enable tight control of glucose concentrations within the target range.","Interventions for prevention of neonatal hyperglycemia in very low birth weight infants Blood sugar levels higher than usually seen in full term infants are frequently seen in babies born very early (before 32 weeks gestation) or with very low birth weight (< 1500 grams) and who are fed totally or partially by vein. Several types of adverse outcomes have been associated with high blood sugar levels including increased risks for death, infections, vision problems, and bleeding into the brain. It is not known if prevention of high blood sugar levels improves those complications and, if so, which intervention is best. Possible options include restriction of the amount of sugar delivered by vein to nourish the baby or administration of insulin. Trials which compared lower with higher amounts of sugar delivered by vein were too small to determine effects on the health outcomes of the babies. Insulin was found to reduce the number of babies who developed high blood sugar levels, but the health outcomes of the babies were not improved. In fact, insulin infusion was associated with an increased risk of death before 28 days of age.",CD007615
"Background Different pharmacological approaches aimed at opioid detoxification are effective. Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse to heroin use, and relapses are a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of heroin users. Some studies have suggested that the sorts of symptoms which are most distressing to addicts during detoxification are psychological rather than physiological symptoms associated with the withdrawal syndrome. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any pharmacological interventions versus any pharmacological alone for opioid detoxification, in helping patients to complete the treatment, reduce the use of substances and improve health and social status. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register (June 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2011), PUBMED (1996 to June 2011); EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2011); CINAHL (January 2003 to June 2008); PsycINFO (1985 to April 2003) and reference list of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trial which focus on any psychosocial associated with any pharmacological intervention aimed at opioid detoxification. People less than 18 years of age and pregnant women were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials quality and extracted data. Main results Eleven studies, 1592 participants, fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. The studies considered five different psychosocial interventions and two pharmacological treatments (methadone and buprenorphine). Compared to any pharmacological treatment alone, the association of any psychosocial with any pharmacological was shown to significantly reduce dropouts RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85), use of opiate during the treatment, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.93), at follow up RR 0.66 (95% IC 0.53 to 0.82) and clinical absences during the treatment RR 0.48 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.59). Moreover, with the evidence currently available, there are no data supporting a single psychosocial approach. Authors' conclusions Psychosocial treatments offered in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatments are effective in terms of completion of treatment, use of opiate, participants abstinent at follow‐up and clinical attendance. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct psychosocial approaches that might make detoxification more effective.","Psychosocial and pharmacological treatments versus pharmacological treatments for opioid detoxification People who abuse opioid drugs and become dependent on them experience social issues and health risks. Medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are substituted to help dependent drug users detoxify and return to living drug free, by reducing physiological withdrawal symptoms (pharmacological detoxification). Yet psychological symptoms can occur during detoxification and may be distressing. It is often a personal crisis that led to a drug user deciding to detoxify. Furthermore the psychological reasons why a person became addicted are important. They may not be able to cope with stress and have come to expect that using mood modifying illicit substances helps. Even after successful return to a drug‐free state, many people return to heroin use and re‐addiction is a substantial problem in rehabilitation. The physiological, behavioural and social conditions in an individual's life that made them an opiate addict may still be present when physical dependence on the drug has been eliminated, which makes psychosocial therapy important. Psychosocial treatments include behavioural treatments, counselling and family therapy.   The review authors searched the medical literature and found evidence that providing a psychosocial treatment in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatment to adults who are dependent on heroin use is effective in facilitating opioid detoxification. This conclusion is based on eleven controlled studies involving 1592 adults. The addition of a psychosocial treatment to substitution detoxification treatment improved the number of people who completed treatment (relative risk (RR) 1.47), reduced the use of opiate (RR 0.82), increased abstinence from opiate at follow up (RR 2.43) and halved the number of failures to attend clinic absences (RR 0.48). The findings of an improved rate of clinical attendance may help in suppressing illicit drug use and provides clinical staff with more opportunities to counsel patients in psychiatric, employment and other drug and non‐drug related areas. Variations in the populations who are substance users and use of a wide range of different psychosocial interventions means that it is difficult to single out particular therapeutic interventions.",CD005031
"Background Social marketing interventions have been shown to both promote and change many health‐related behaviours and issues. As the HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately affect MSM and transgender women around the world, social marketing interventions have the potential to increase HIV/STI testing uptake among these populations. Objectives To assess the impact of social marketing interventions on HIV/STI testing uptake among men who have sex with men and transgender women compared to pre‐intervention or control group testing uptake in the same population. Search methods We searched the following electronic databasesfor results from 01 January 1980 to the search date, 14 July 2010: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, LILACS (Latin America and Brazil), PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science/Web of Social Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and CQ VIP (China). We also searched for conference abstracts in the Aegis archive of HIV/AIDS conference abstracts and the CROI and International AIDS Society websites. In addition to searching electronic databases, we searched the following sources of grey literature: Australasian Digital Theses Program, Canadian Evaluation Society,  Eastview: China Conference Proceedings, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and World Health Organization Library Information System  (WHOLIS). We contacted individual researchers, experts working in the field, and authors of major trials for suggestions of any relevant manuscripts that were in preparation or in press. References of published articles from the databases above were searched for additional, pertinent materials. All languages were included in this search. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared social marketing interventions with a control were included. Interrupted time series and pretest‐posttest design studies (controlled or uncontrolled) that compared social marketing interventions with no intervention or a control were also included. Posttest‐only studies and studies that combined pre‐post data were excluded. Interventions that targeted at general public but did not include MSM or transgender women as a segment or did not have outcome data for an MSM or transgender segment were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from each included study and assessed study quality. Meta‐analyses were conducted to compare pre‐ and post‐intervention and intervention and control group outcomes of HIV and STI testing uptake. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results Three serial, cross‐sectional pretest‐posttest study designs (one with a control group and two without) were included in the final analysis. Statistical pooling was conducted for two studies and compared to pre‐intervention level testing uptake, which showed that multi‐media social marketing campaigns had a significant impact on HIV testing uptake (OR=1.58, 95%CI = 1.40 ‐ 1.77). However, the campaigns were not found to be effective in increasing STI testing uptake (OR=0.94, 95%CI = 0.68 ‐ 1.28). Overall, risk of bias was high and quality of evidence was low. None of the studies were conducted in developing countries or included male‐to‐female transgender women. Authors' conclusions This review provided limited evidence that multi‐media social marketing campaigns can promote HIV testing among MSM in developed countries. Future evaluations of social marketing interventions for MSM should employ more rigorous study designs. Long‐term impact evaluations (changes in HIV or STI incidence over time) are also needed. Implementation research, including detailed process evaluation, is needed to identify elements of social marketing interventions that are most effective in reaching the target population and changing behaviours.","Multi‐media social marketing campaigns to increase HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men and transgender women Men who have sex with men and transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS worldwide. Unrecognized infections could be one of the driving forces of ongoing HIV transmission among these populations. Thus, it is important to promote HIV testing. Limited evidence suggests that multi‐media social marketing campaigns can significantly increase HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men. Future research should employ more rigorous designs in evaluating social marketing interventions, measure their long‐term impact, and identify intervention components that are most effective in reaching the target population and changing behaviours.",CD009337
"Background Myopia (near‐sightedness or short‐sightedness) is one of the three commonly detected refractive (focusing) errors. Acupuncture is the stimulation of acupuncture points by various methods including needle insertion and acupressure. It is often used by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to treat myopia in children. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in slowing the progression of myopia in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2011), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to July 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2011), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrial.gov ), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (The first issue to August 2010), the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM) (1978 to April 2011), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to April 2011) and VIP (1989 to April 2011). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, LILACS,  m RCT and ClinicalTrials.gov were last searched on 9 July 2011. NCCAM was searched up to August 2010 and CBM, CNKI, and VIP were last searched on 6 April 2011. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included any type of acupuncture treatment for myopia in children and adolescents. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently evaluated the search results according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors extracted and assessed data independently. We contacted the study investigator for missing data. Main results We included two RCTs conducted in Taiwan with a total of 131 participants. We did not perform a meta‐analysis as the trials were assessing different outcomes. Neither trial met our pre‐defined primary outcome criteria of myopia progression defined as one diopter mean change. Only one trial reported the changes of axial length without non‐significant difference among groups and both trials reported that several children experienced mild pain during acupuncture stimulation. Authors' conclusions Two trials are included in this review but no conclusions can be drawn for the benefit of co‐acupressure for slowing progress of myopia in children. Further evidence in the form of RCTs are needed before any recommendations can be made for the use of acupuncture treatment in clinical use. These trials should compare acupuncture to placebo and have large sample sizes. Other types of acupuncture (such as auricular acupuncture) should be explored further as well as compliance with treatment for at least six months or longer. Axial length elongation of the eye should be investigated for at least one year. The potential to reduce/eliminate pain from acupuncture experienced by children should also be reviewed.","Acupuncture for near‐sightedness in children Myopia, also called near‐sightedness or short‐sightedness, is one of the most commonly occurring eye problems in children and adolescents. Early detection and treatment of initial myopia is associated with better outcomes of visual improvement and correction. Myopia is usually managed by wearing glasses and/or contact lenses. It is common practice for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to use acupuncture for the treatment of myopia. Acupuncture is the stimulation of acupuncture points by needle insertion, acupressure, surface electrical and laser stimulation. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in slowing the progression of myopia in children and adolescents. We included two studies conducted in Taiwan with a total of 131 school children and did not combine the results as the two trials assessed different outcomes. One study found no significant difference in changes in the length of the eyes. Both studies found several children experienced mild pain while pressing and dropped out. The included studies in this review were unable to provide evidence of the effect of acupuncture for slowing the progression of myopia. More trials should be conducted where acupuncture is compared to placebo, other types of acupuncture are investigated, compliance with treatment for at least six months is explored and axial length elongation of the eye should be for at least one year.",CD007842
"Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairment in social interaction, impairment in communication and lack of flexibility of thought and behavior. Acupuncture, which involves the use of needles or pressure to specific points on the body, is used widely in Traditional Chinese Medicine and increasingly within a western medical paradigm. It has sometimes been used as a treatment aimed at improving ASD symptoms and outcomes, but its clinical effectiveness and safety has not been rigorously reviewed. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with ASD in improving core autistic features, as well as communication, cognition, overall functioning and quality of life, and to establish if it has any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the following databases on 30 September 2010: CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library,  2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2010 Week 2), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 38), PsycINFO, CINAHL, China Journal Full‐text Database, China Master Theses Full‐text Database, China Doctor Dissertation Full‐text Database, China Proceedings of Conference Database, Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System, metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry. We also searched AMED (26 February 2009) and Dissertation Abstracts International (3 March 2009), but these were no longer available to the authors or editorial base at the date of the most recent search. TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) was last searched on 3 March 2009. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials. We included studies comparing an acupuncture group with at least one control group that used no treatment, placebo or sham acupuncture treatment in people with ASD. We excluded trials that compared different forms of acupuncture or compared acupuncture with another treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Main results We included 10 trials that involved 390 children with ASD. The age range was three to 18 years and the treatment duration ranged from four weeks to nine months. The studies were carried out in Hong Kong, mainland China and Egypt. Two trials compared needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture and found no difference in the primary outcome of core autistic features (RFRLRS total score: MD 0.09; 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.21, P = 0.16), although results suggested needle acupuncture might be associated with improvement in some aspects of the secondary outcomes of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning. Six trials compared needle acupuncture plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone. The trials used different primary outcome measures and most could not demonstrate effectiveness of acupuncture in improving core autistic features in general, though one trial reported patients in the acupuncture group were more likely to have improvement on the Autism Behavior Checklist (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16, P = 0.02) and had slightly better post‐treatment total scores (MD ‐5.53; 95% CI ‐10.76 to ‐0.31, P = 0.04). There was no evidence that acupuncture was effective for the secondary outcome of communication and linguistic ability, though there seemed to be some benefit for the secondary outcomes of cognitive function and global functioning. Two trials compared acupressure plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone and did not report on the primary outcome. Individual study results suggested there may be some benefit from acupressure for certain aspects of the secondary outcomes of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning. Four trials reported some adverse effects, though there was little quantitative information, and at times both intervention and control groups experienced them. Adverse effects noted included bleeding, crying due to fear or pain, irritability, sleep disturbance and increased hyperactivity. None of the trials reported on quality of life. There are a number of problems with the evidence base: the trials were few in number and included only children; six of the trials were at high risk of bias; they were heterogeneous in terms of participants and intervention; they were of short duration and follow‐up; they reported inconsistent and imprecise results, and, due to carrying out large numbers of analyses, they were at risk of false positivity. Authors' conclusions Current evidence does not support the use of acupuncture for treatment of ASD. There is no conclusive evidence that acupuncture is effective for treatment of ASD in children and no RCTs have been carried out with adults. Further high quality trials of larger size and longer follow‐up are needed.","Acupuncture for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are lifelong disorders of development. People with ASD have particular difficulties with social interaction and communication and they lack flexibility in their thinking and behavior. No cure is currently available but interventions may improve symptoms. Acupuncture involves using needles or pressure on specific areas of the body and is an important therapeutic method in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is also being used more and more in countries in the west for a range of ailments. Acupuncture has been considered as a possible intervention to improve ASD symptoms, but it has not been thoroughly evaluated to see if it works and is safe. We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for ASD by systematically reviewing all studies of acupuncture for ASD where people were randomly allocated to a treatment or control group (placebo, sham or no treatment), i.e. randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched through 15 databases, most recently in September 2010, and read over the titles and abstracts to make sure we identified everything relevant. We found10 RCTs to include in this review. These studies, which were carried out in Hong Kong, mainland China and Egypt, involved 390 children aged between three and 18 years. Two studies compared needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture and found no difference in core autistic features. Results did suggest that needle acupuncture might be associated with improvement in other areas of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning. Six studies compared needle acupuncture plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone. They used a range of tools to measure core autistic features and most could not show that acupuncture led to improvement in these. One trial did report, though, that needle acupuncture led to an improvement in scores on Autism Behavior Checklist. There was no evidence for improvement due to acupuncture on communication and linguistic ability but it might be beneficial for cognitive function and global functioning. Two studies compared acupressure plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone and found no difference in core autistic features, although acupressure seemed to improve some aspects of the secondary outcomes. Problems that were noted by parents of study participants included crying due to fear or pain, bleeding, sleep disturbance and increased hyperactivity. It is unclear if these were due to the acupuncture treatment. Half of the trials reported some negative effects but did not report how often or how severe these were and sometimes the problems occurred in both the treatment and control groups. None of the studies used measures of quality of life. Overall, acupuncture did not seem to be effective in improving core features of ASD but it might have improved certain developmental and functioning outcomes, at least in the short term. There are problems with assessing acupuncture due to the quality of the evidence. There were a small number of studies and they were all conducted with children. Moreover, there is a high likelihood that they may have been biased due to the methods used not being rigorous enough, the wide variety in the people and interventions in the studies, the inconsistent and imprecise reporting of results and the large number of analyses carried out, which make it more likely a significant result will be found just by chance. In conclusion, current evidence does not support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of ASD. We need high quality trials of larger size and longer follow‐up as the evidence base at present has many limitations.",CD007849
"Background Statins have been claimed to be effective in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. The potential positive actions of statins during an acute cerebrovascular ischemic event are two‐fold: a neuroprotective effect, limiting damage and improving recovery; and a preventative effect on early recurrence. Objectives To quantify the potential benefits and harms of statins in the acute treatment of cerebrovascular ischemic events (both transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and ischemic stroke). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trials Register (November 2010); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to November 2010); and EMBASE (1980 to November 2010). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trials and research registers (November 2010), checked reference lists from relevant articles and contacted authors. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statins (any type and dosage) versus placebo or no treatment, administered within two weeks of the onset of acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed methodological quality and, when necessary, contacted study authors for additional data. We based quantitative analysis of outcome on the intention‐to‐treat principle. The primary outcomes were mortality from ischemic stroke and mortality from adverse drug effects, bleedings and infections. We estimated the overall treatment effect by the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed‐effect model (Mantel‐Haenszel). Main results We included eight RCTs involving 625 participants. Only one study was judged as 'low risk' of bias. There were insufficient published data from the eight studies for all planned primary and secondary outcomes. No patients died from ischemic stroke or from adverse drug effects, bleeding or infections among the 444 participants in the six studies where these outcomes were reported. Statin treatment did not reduce all‐cause mortality compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.81) in the 431 patients enrolled in seven studies. No cases of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of muscle fibres resulting in the release of muscle fibre contents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream) occurred in 274 patients enrolled in three studies. Authors' conclusions Insufficient data were available from randomized trials to establish if statins are safe and effective in cases of acute ischemic stroke and TIA.","Statins for acute ischemic stroke Stroke is a major public health problem than can cause death and severe disability. A limited number of drugs are available for treating patients with stroke. Statins, a group of drugs commonly used to reduce cholesterol levels, are known to be safe and effective when given to patients with an acute heart attack. Therefore, they may also be beneficial in patients with acute stroke. We identified eight relevant trials of statins in acute stroke involving 625 participants. Unfortunately, insufficient information was available to establish whether statins are safe and beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke",CD007551
"Background The question of the target blood pressure in pregnant women with mild‐moderate hypertension continues to be an area of debate. Objectives To compare tight versus very tight control of mild‐moderate pre‐existing or non‐proteinuric gestational hypertension for improving outcomes Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2011), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (31 March 2011). We handsearched citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, and included studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of tight versus very tight control in pregnant women with mild or moderate pre‐existing or non‐proteinuric gestational hypertension. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We expressed results as risk ratio (RR) or mean differences, together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included two studies (256 participants) with mild‐moderate pre‐existing or non‐proteinuric gestational hypertension. There was no evidence of a difference between tight and very tight control groups regarding severe pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.70; two trials, 256 participants). More women in the tight group were hospitalized during their pregnancy (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.63; one trial, 125 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in other outcome measures including fetal distress, IUGR, neonatal admission to a NICU, perinatal deaths, induction of labor and cesarean delivery between the tight and the very tight control groups. Gestational age at delivery had a non‐significant mean difference (MD) of ‐0.15 weeks between the tight and very tight control groups (MD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐1.52 to 1.21, random‐effects, T² = 0.75, I² = 77%; two trials, 256 participants). The MD in birthweight between the tight and the very tight control group was not significant (MD ‐100.00 grams, 95% CI ‐363.69 to 163.69; one trial, 125 participants). Authors' conclusions For pregnant women with non‐severe pre‐existing or non‐proteinuric gestational hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to determine how tight control of hypertension should be achieved to improve maternal and fetal‐neonatal outcomes.","Tight control of mild‐to‐moderate high blood pressure for pregnant women with pre‐existing or gestational hypertension (without protein in the urine) to improve health outcomes  High blood pressure (hypertension) is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more. In the general population, a tight control of blood pressure reduces cardiovascular risks and is particularly important for people with diabetes or renal disease. Having high blood pressure during pregnancy is a complex clinical condition. Adverse effects include premature separation of the placenta (abruption), low birthweight, and perinatal death. Women who do not have regular antenatal care, those with severe uncontrolled hypertension and pre‐eclampsia are more likely to have poor outcomes. A woman with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension could develop severe hypertension if not managed correctly. On the other hand, lowering blood pressure dramatically may reduce placental perfusion, which could lead to fetal growth restriction, without providing extra benefit to the mother. There is no consensus regarding a clear goal of adjusting blood pressure in pregnant women with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension. This systematic review set out to compare the effects of 'tight' versus 'very tight' control of mild to moderate pre‐existing or non‐proteinuric gestational hypertension on pregnancy outcomes. It found insufficient evidence to determine which degree of control of blood pressure during pregnancy was more effective for improving outcomes for the mother and her baby. The review included two trials that studied 256 women. A blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg using methyldopa reduced the rate of admission to hospital during pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference between tight and very tight control groups regarding severe pre‐eclampsia, induction of labor and cesarean delivery and no cases of eclampsia or maternal deaths.",CD006907
"Background Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the world. Decisions to smoke are often made within a broad social context and therefore community interventions using coordinated, multi‐component programmes may be effective in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of multi‐component community based interventions in influencing smoking behaviour, which includes preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. Search methods The Tobacco Addiction group's specialised register, Medline and other health, psychology and public policy electronic databases were searched, the bibliographies of identified studies were checked and raw data was requested from study authors. Searches were updated in August 2010. Selection criteria Randomized and non randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of multi‐component community interventions compared to no intervention or to single component or school‐based programmes only. Reported outcomes had to include smoking behaviour in young people under the age of 25 years. Data collection and analysis Information relating to the characteristics and the content of community interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the study was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Studies were combined in a meta‐analysis where possible and reported in narrative synthesis in text and table. Main results Twenty‐five studies were included in the review and sixty‐eight studies did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. All studies used a controlled trial design, with fifteen using random allocation of schools or communities. One study reported a reduction in short‐term smoking prevalence (twelve months or less), while nine studies detected significant long‐term effects. Two studies reported significantly lower smoking rates in the control population while the remaining thirteen studies showed no significant difference between groups. Improvements were seen in secondary outcomes for intentions to smoke in six out of eight studies, attitudes in five out of nine studies, perceptions in two out of six studies and knowledge in three out of six studies, while significant differences in favour of the control were seen in one of the nine studies assessing attitudes and one of six studies assessing perceptions. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of community interventions in reducing the uptake of smoking in young people, but the evidence is not strong and contains a number of methodological flaws.","Can community interventions deter young people from starting to smoke? Some evidence is available to suggest that multi‐component community interventions are effective in influencing smoking behaviour and preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. These interventions use co‐ordinated, widespread, multi‐component programmes to try and influence young people's behaviour. Community members are often involved in determining and/or implementing these programmes. These include education of tobacco retailers about age restrictions, programmes for prevention of smoking‐related diseases, mass media, school and family‐based programmes. Changes in intentions to smoke, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about smoking did not generally appear to affect the long‐term success of the programmes.",CD001291
"Background Adherence to complex regimens for patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in DKD is still unknown. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with DKD. Search methods In January 2010 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and four Chinese medicine databases (CBM‐disc, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China National Infrastructure and WanFang). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs studying the benefits and harms of educational programmes for people with DKD. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). Data were pooled using the random effects model. Main results Two studies (207 patients) were eligible. The methodological quality was not high. Compared with no educational programmes, educational programmes for patients with diabetes on dialysis improved patients' knowledge for the following outcomes: diagnosis (SMD 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.90); monitoring (SMD 1.51, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.01); hypoglycaemia (SMD 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.17), hyperglycaemia (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.25); medication with insulin (SMD 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68); oral medication (SMD 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to1.43); personal health habits (SMD 1.84, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.36); diet (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97); exercise (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.60); chronic complications (SMD 1.28, 95% CI 0.80 to1.75) and living with diabetes and coping with stress (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.15). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved general knowledge for the following outcomes: diabetes (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.26); patients' total self‐efficacy (MD 19.00, 95% CI 12.58 to 25.42) and patients' changes in beliefs on treatment effectiveness (MD 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) at the end of treatment, and general knowledge (MD 14.39, 95% CI 7.45 to 21.33); specific self‐efficacy in home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) (MD 11.28, 95% CI 1.92 to 20.64) and changes of beliefs on personal control (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61) at the end of three‐months follow‐up. For patients with diabetes on dialysis, educational programmes also showed improvement in the following self‐management behaviours: checking feet (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.63); using lotion (RR 9.71, 95% CI 2.45 to 38.56) and wearing appropriate shoes and socks (RR 4.39, 95% CI 1.87 to 10.32). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved the following behaviours: general diet (MD 0.73, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.36), specific diet (MD 1.02, 95% CI 0.42 to1.62) and HBGM (MD 2.13, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.08) at the end of treatment; and specific diet (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.06) and HBGM (MD 1.48, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.48) at the end of three‐months follow‐up. No data were available on changes in kidney function, incidence of cardiovascular events, change of patients' attitude or adverse events. Authors' conclusions Education programmes appear to have beneficial effects on improving patients' knowledge of diabetes and some self‐management behavioural changes for patients with diabetes on dialysis or with microalbuminuria. Educational programmes appear to have beneficial effects on improving patients' self‐efficacy and result in some beliefs changes for patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria. However, only two studies with small sample sizes and inadequate quality were included in this review. There is, therefore, inadequate evidence to support the beneficial effects of education programmes for people with DKD.","Education programmes for people with diabetic kidney disease Adherence to complex regimens is often poor in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DKD). Interventions to enhance adherence require both intensive education and behavioural counselling. This review looked for randomised trials (RCTs) comparing education programmes with other strategies in patients with DKD. Only two studies involving patients with DKD were identified. Although education programmes seemed to have some beneficial effects on improvement of patients' knowledge of diabetes, self‐efficacy, belief changes and self‐management behavioural changes, the small (207) numbers of patients enrolled in the two identified studies and their low methodological quality resulted in cautious assessment. Larger, high‐quality RCTs are needed.",CD007374
"Background Standard surgical management of infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) is laparotomy with the resection of the necrotic or perforated segments of the intestine. Peritoneal drainage is an alternative approach to the management of such infants. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and risks of peritoneal drainage compared to laparotomy as the initial surgical treatment for perforated NEC or SIP in preterm infants. Search methods Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2010), EMBASE (1980 to July 2010), CINAHL (1982 to July 2010), previous reviews and cross‐references were searched. Abstracts of paediatric academic society meetings were also searched (online: 2000 to 2009; handsearching Pediatric Research: 1995 to 2000). Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in preterm (< 37 weeks gestation), low birth weight (< 2500 g) infants with perforated NEC or SIP allocated to peritoneal drainage or laparotomy as initial surgical treatment. Data collection and analysis Data were excerpted from the trial reports and analysed according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results Only two randomised controlled trials (RCT) met the eligibility criteria. Overall, no significant differences were seen between the peritoneal drainage and laparotomy groups regarding the incidence of mortality within 28 days of the primary procedure (28/90 versus 30/95; typical relative risk (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.52; N = 185, two trials); mortality by 90 days after the primary procedure (typical RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.55; N = 185, two trials) and the number of infants needing total parenteral nutrition for more than 90 days (typical RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.95; N = 116, two trials). Nearly 50% of the infants in the peritoneal drainage group could avoid the need for laparotomy during the study period (44/90 versus 95/96; typical RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; N = 186, two trials). One study found that the time to attain full enteral feeds in infants ≤ 1000 g was prolonged in the peritoneal drainage group (mean difference (MD) 20.77, 95% CI 3.62 to 37.92). Authors' conclusions Evidence from two RCTs suggests no significant benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy. However, due to the very small sample size, clinically significant differences may have easily been missed. No firm recommendations can be made for clinicians. Large multicentre randomised controlled trials are needed to address this question definitively.","Peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy as initial surgical treatment for perforated necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation in preterm low birth weight infants Intestinal perforation is a very serious condition in very premature babies. Standard treatment of intestinal perforation is the surgical opening of the abdomen and removal of the unhealthy or dead intestine. Insertion of a drain into the abdomen instead of surgical opening has been tried to treat this condition. This review did not find any significant advantages or harms of insertion of the drain over surgically opening the abdomen; however, there is too little evidence to fully understand the risks and benefits of this approach.",CD006182
"Background Despite changes in technique, morbidity after surgery for vulvar cancer is high and mainly related to the groin dissection. Primary radiotherapy to the groin is expected to result in lower morbidity. However, studies on the efficacy of primary radiotherapy to the groin in terms of groin recurrences and survival show conflicting results. Objectives To determine whether the effectiveness and safety of primary radiotherapy to the inguinofemoral lymph nodes in early vulvar cancer is comparable with surgery. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to July 2010 for the latest update in 2011. We searched again in January 2016 and no additional trails were identified. Selection criteria We selected randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing inguinofemoral lymph node dissection and primary radiotherapy of the inguinofemoral lymph nodes for patients with early squamous cell cancer of the vulva. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and extracted results. Primary outcome measures were the incidence of groin recurrences, patient survival and morbidity. Main results No new RCTs were identified by the updated search. Out of twelve identified papers only one met the selection criteria. From this one small RCT of 52 women, there was a trend towards increased groin recurrence rates (relative risk (RR) 10.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 175.78), lower disease‐specific survival rates (RR 3.70, 95% CI 0.87 to 15.80), less lymphoedema (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.03) and fewer life‐threatening cardiovascular complications (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.45) in the radiotherapy group. Primary surgery was associated with a longer hospital stay than primary groin irradiation (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58). Authors' conclusions Primary radiotherapy to the groin results in less morbidity but may be associated with a higher risk of groin recurrence and decreased survival when compared with surgery. Due to the small numbers in this trial and criticisms regarding the depth of radiotherapy applied, corroboration of these findings by larger RCTs using a standardised radiotherapy method, is desirable. However, until better evidence is available, surgery should be considered the first choice treatment for the groin nodes in women with vulvar cancer. Individual patients not physically able to withstand surgery may be treated with primary radiotherapy.","There is insufficient evidence that radiotherapy works as well as surgery for treating groin nodes in early vulvar cancer. Cancer of the vulva is mainly a disease of elderly women. Surgery involves removal of the tumour and surrounding lymph nodes, occasionally followed by radiotherapy. Although survival rates are high if the tumour is found early enough, removal of the lymph nodes causes odema (swelling), particularly in the legs. Wound healing and psychosexual problems are also common. While radiotherapy may be effective in the short term, there is not enough evidence from trials to show that it is as effective as surgery in preventing tumour regrowth in the lymph nodes of the groin.",CD002224
"Background It has been argued that individuals with fragile X syndrome could have low folate levels in their bodies and that supplementing their dietary intake might remediate the adverse developmental and behavioural effects of the condition. Objectives To review the efficacy and safety of folic acid in the treatment of people with fragile X syndrome. Search methods We searched four databases in November 2010: CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Main results We included five trials, which were published between 1986 and 1992. Overall, they included 67 patients, all male, with ages ranging from one to 54 years. Intellectual disability in participants varied from borderline to severe and some studies included patients with an additional diagnosis of autism or autistic behaviour. Four of the studies were placebo‐controlled cross‐over trials and one study was a parallel design. The duration of follow‐up ranged from two months to 12 months and the period on folic acid or placebo ranged from two to eight months. Doses of folic acid ranged from 10 mg to 250 mg per day, 10 mg per day being the most common. Most of the younger patients involved were also taking part in special education programmes (usually involving language and occupational therapy). We were not able to perform meta‐analysis to combine results but none of the individual studies found evidence of clinical benefit with the use of folic acid medication in fragile X syndrome patients on any of the areas of interest, either psychological and learning capabilities or behaviour and social performance, as measured with standardised tools. Separate analysis of evidence for patients of different age groups, i.e. prepubertal children and postpubertal young people, found some statistically significant results, but did not show clear evidence of benefit for either group. Adverse effects of folic acid treatment were rare, not serious and transient. Studies were generally poorly reported and we classified only one study as being at low risk of bias. Authors' conclusions The quality of available evidence is low and not suitable for drawing conclusions about the effect of folic acid on fragile X syndrome patients. It consists of few studies with small samples of patients, all of them male, with little statistical power to detect anything other than huge effects.","Folic acid for fragile X syndrome People with fragile X syndrome (or FXS) have intellectual limitations that can range from mild to severe. Fragile X syndrome is considered the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and it has been estimated that it affects approximately 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. Folate is particularly important during the early development of the brain and in later life is involved in methylation processes that are essential for the maintenance of normal brain function. It was observed that cells from patients with fragile X syndrome cultured in solutions deficient in folic acid revealed a fragile site at the X chromosome; consequently it was thought that individuals with fragile X syndrome had low folate levels in their bodies, which may be due to insufficient dietary intake, inefficient absorption or impaired metabolic utilisation. It was argued that supplementing their dietary intake might help improve the adverse developmental and behavioural effects of the condition. This review asks whether folic acid helps improve symptoms in people with fragile X syndrome and whether it has any side effects. We found five randomised controlled trials, all of which were published between 1986 and 1992. These studies included 69 people, all male. One of the studies compared a folic acid group with a control group; the other four used a cross‐over design (i.e. participants received first one treatment and then the other). The quality of reporting of the trials was generally poor, particularly the methods used, which made it difficult to assess the risk of bias in the studies. The results of the few published studies did not find significant differences in the effects of folic acid or placebo on psychological or learning capabilities, behaviour or social performance, as measured by standardised tools. There is therefore no evidence to support the recommendation of supplementing dietary intake with folic acid medication for people with fragile X syndrome. However, due to the number and quality of the studies, it is not possible to conclude with any certainty that folic acid does not help. Given that intellectual, behavioural, emotional and/or learning performance in people with fragile X syndrome are strongly influenced by different social factors, future studies should also pay attention to the evaluation of non‐pharmacological interventions, such as modifications in the home environment, tailored behavioural interventions and classroom environments, or language and occupational therapy.",CD008476
"Background Standard treatment for high grade glioma (HGG) usually entails surgery (either biopsy or resection) followed by radiotherapy plus or minus temozolomide. Implanting wafers impregnated with chemotherapy agents into the resection cavity represents a novel means of delivering drugs directly to the resection cavity with potentially fewer systemic side effects. It is not clear how effective this modality is or whether it should be recommended as part of standard care for patients with HGG. Objectives To estimate the clinical effectiveness of chemotherapy wafers for patients with HGG. Search methods The following databases were searched: CENTRAL (issue 4. 2010); MEDLINE and EMBASE. The original search strategy also included: Science Citation Index; Physician Data Query; and the meta‐Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of all identified studies were searched. The Journal of Neuro‐Oncology and Neuro‐oncology were hand searched from 1999 to 2010, including all conference abstracts. Neuro‐oncologists, trial authors and drug manufacturers were contacted regarding ongoing and unpublished trials. Selection criteria Patients included those of all ages with a histologically proven diagnosis of HGG (using intra‐operative analysis when undergoing first resection). Therapy could be instigated for either newly diagnosed disease (primary therapy) or at recurrence. Interventions included insertion of chemotherapy wafers to the resection cavity. Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors assessed the search results for relevance and undertook critical appraisal according to pre‐specified guidelines. Main results In primary disease two RCTs assessing the effect of carmustine impregnated wafers (Gliadel®) and enrolling a total of 272 participants were identified. Survival was increased with Gliadel® compared to placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.86, P = 0.003). In recurrent disease a single RCT was included comparing Gliadel® with placebo and enrolled 222 participants. It did not demonstrate a significant survival increase (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.10, P = 0.2). There was no suitable data for any of the secondary outcome measures. Adverse events were not more common in either arm and are presented in a descriptive fashion. Authors' conclusions Carmustine impregnated wafers (Gliadel®) result in improved survival without an increased incidence of adverse events over placebo wafers when used for primary disease therapy. There is no evidence of benefit for any other outcome measures. In recurrent disease Gliadel® does not appear to confer any additional benefit.","Treatment of high grade glioma with anti‐cancer drug (chemotherapy) coated implants High grade glioma is a rapidly progressive form of brain tumour. Standard therapy involves the use of surgery (either biopsy or resection) and radiotherapy plus or minus temozolomide. Chemotherapy was not previously used due to concerns over efficacy and high risks of side effects. We found two trials, enrolling 272 people in total, with newly diagnosed high grade glioma, that studied the effects of implanting wafers coated with an anti‐cancer drug called carmustine (Gliadel®) in the area where the tumour was removed. This was compared with implanting wafers that contained no drug. Both groups received radiotherapy afterwards. Patients who received carmustine wafers had a longer survival without a demonstrably higher incidence of adverse events (side effects). A similar trial enrolled 222 people who had already been diagnosed with a high grade glioma and received surgery but had then had a relapse of disease. In this situation the trial found that Gliadel® did not improve survival or any other outcome measure looked at.",CD007294
"Background Elective medical or surgical procedures are commonplace for neonates admitted to NICU. Agents such as opioids are commonly used for achieving sedation/analgesia/anaesthesia for such procedures; however, these agents are associated with adverse effects. Propofol is used widely in paediatric and adult populations for this purpose. The efficacy and safety of the use of propofol in neonates has not been defined. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of propofol treatment compared to placebo or no treatment or alternate active agents in neonates undergoing sedation or anaesthesia for procedures. To conduct subgroup analyses according to method of propofol administration (bolus or continuous infusion), type of active control agent (neuromuscular blocking agents with or without the use of sedative, analgesics or anxiolytics), type of procedure (endotracheal intubation, eye examination, other procedure), and gestational age (preterm and term). Search methods We searched MEDLINE (1950 to September 30, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to September 30, 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 2) for eligible studies without language restriction. We searched reference lists of identified articles and abstracts submitted to Pediatric Academic Societies (2002 to 2009), and international trials registries for eligible articles. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of propofol versus placebo, no treatment or other sedative/anaesthetic/analgesic agents in isolation or combination used in neonates for procedures. Data collection and analysis We collected and analysed data in accordance with the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results One open‐label randomised controlled trial of 63 neonates was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐three neonates in the propofol group were compared to 30 infants in the morphine‐atropine‐suxamethonium group. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of infants who required multiple intubation attempts (39% in the propofol group versus 57% in the morphine‐atropine‐suxamethonium group; RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.29). Times required to prepare medication, to complete the procedure and for recovery to previous clinical status were shorter in the propofol group. No difference in clinically significant side effects was observed; however, the number of events was small. Authors' conclusions No practice recommendation can be made based on the available evidence regarding the use of propofol in neonates. Further research is needed on the pharmacokinetics of propofol in neonates and once a relatively safe dose is identified, randomised controlled trials assessing the safety and efficacy of propofol are needed.","Propofol use for sedation in newborn babies undergoing procedures Procedures performed in preterm and term neonates can be stressful and at times painful. Medications to reduce stress/pain for babies can lead to side effects. Propofol is a commonly used medication in adults and children to achieve sedation during minor procedures or major operations. Its use in newborn babies is studied in only one study of 63 babies. Propofol helped to reduce time to complete procedure, time of recovery and time to prepare drugs. However, with this small number of newborns studied, the safety can not be proven. Further studies are warranted.",CD007248
"Background Residents of nursing care homes for older people are highly likely to die there, making these places where palliative care is needed. Objectives The primary objective was to determine effectiveness of multi‐component palliative care service delivery interventions for residents of care homes for older people. The secondary objective was to describe the range and quality of outcome measures. Search methods The grey literature and the following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (all issue 1, 2010); MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, (1806 to February 2010), Science Citation Index Expanded & AMED (all to February 2010). Key journals were hand searched and a PubMed related articles link search was conducted on the final list of articles. Selection criteria We planned to include Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs), Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies of multi‐component palliative care service delivery interventions for residents of care homes for older people. These usually include the assessment and management of physical, psychological and spiritual symptoms and advance care planning. We did not include individual components of palliative care, such as advance care planning. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias. Meta analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity of studies. The analysis comprised a structured narrative synthesis. Outcomes for residents and process of care measures were reported separately. Main results Two RCTs and one controlled before‐and‐after study were included (735 participants). All were conducted in the USA and had several potential sources of bias. Few outcomes for residents were assessed. One study reported higher satisfaction with care and the other found lower observed discomfort in residents with end‐stage dementia. Two studies reported group differences on some process measures. Both reported higher referral to hospice services in their intervention group, one found fewer hospital admissions and days in hospital in the intervention group, the other found an increase in do‐not‐resuscitate orders and documented advance care plan discussions. Authors' conclusions We found few studies, and all were in the USA. Although the results are potentially promising, high quality trials of palliative care service delivery interventions which assess outcomes for residents are needed, particularly outside the USA. These should focus on measuring standard outcomes, assessing cost‐effectiveness, and reducing bias.","Improving palliative care for older people in care homes People are living longer, however, the very old often have many health problems and disabilities which result in them living and eventually dying in care homes. Residents of such homes are highly likely to die there, making these places where palliative care is needed. Palliative care provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms experienced by people reaching the end of life. Palliative care hopes to help people live as actively as possible until death, and their families cope with the illness and bereavement. The aim of this review was to see how effective palliative care interventions in care homes are, and to describe the outcome measures used in the studies. We found only three suitable studies (735 participants), all from the USA. There was little evidence that interventions to improve palliative care for older people in care homes improved outcomes for residents. One study found that palliative care increased bereaved family members' perceptions of the quality of care and another found lower discomfort for residents with dementia who were dying. There were problems with both of these findings. Two studies found that palliative care improved some of the ways in which care was given in the care home, however, we do not know if this resulted in better outcomes for residents. There is a need for more high quality research, particularly outside the USA.",CD007132
"Background Ménière's disease is characterised by three major symptoms: vertigo, deafness and tinnitus, which may be accompanied by aural fullness, all of which are discontinuous and variable in intensity. While discontinuous, these symptoms are synchronous. Intratympanic application of gentamicin, an ototoxic aminoglycoside, is a relatively new ablative treatment for vertigo in Ménière's disease with promising results. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of vertigo in Ménière's disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2010. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of intratympanic gentamicin versus placebo, or versus another treatment for Ménière's disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for further information. Main results We identified two trials, involving 50 participants, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Both of these trials are prospective, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomised clinical trials on the effect of intratympanic gentamicin on vertigo complaints. After assessing the risk of bias of both studies, we concluded that one had a greater risk of bias and deemed the other to be of higher quality. Both of these trials found a significant reduction in vertigo complaints in the gentamicin group when compared to the placebo group. Due to clinical heterogeneity we could not perform a meta‐analysis. One study described an increase in hearing loss in four patients (25%) treated with gentamicin while the other described no increase in hearing loss. No other adverse effects were noted by either study. Authors' conclusions Based on the results of the two included studies, intratympanic gentamicin seems to be an effective treatment for vertigo complaints in Ménière's disease, but carries a risk of hearing loss.","Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease or syndrome Ménière's disease is characterised by three major symptoms: rotational dizziness (vertigo), hearing loss and ringing in the ears (tinnitus), sometimes accompanied by aural fullness. Intratympanic gentamicin is a relatively new therapy with promising results. Gentamicin is an antibiotic which damages the inner ear and the balance organ when it is applied behind the ear drum. This treatment may decrease the spells of vertigo in Ménière's disease. In this review we assess the effectiveness of this kind of treatment for Ménière's disease. Two randomised controlled trials, including a total of 50 patients, were identified which fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Both of these found a beneficial effect of intratympanic gentamicin therapy for Ménière's disease, although the size of the effect differed between the two trials. Based on these findings, we conclude that intratympanic gentamicin may be an effective treatment for vertigo complaints in Ménière's disease, but it carries a risk of increasing hearing loss. Further research is needed to clarify the effect of intratympanic gentamicin on vertigo in Ménière's disease and the risk of inducing or increasing hearing loss.",CD008234
"Background Hip fracture mainly occurs in older people. Strategies to improve mobility include gait retraining, various forms of exercise and muscle stimulation. Objectives To evaluate the effects of different interventions for improving mobility after hip fracture surgery in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and other databases, and reference lists of articles, up to April 2010. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing different mobilisation strategies after hip fracture surgery. Data collection and analysis The authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. There was no data pooling. Main results The 19 included trials (involving 1589 older adults) were small, often with methodological flaws. Just two pairs of trials tested similar interventions. Twelve trials evaluated mobilisation strategies started soon after hip fracture surgery. Single trials found improved mobility from, respectively, a two‐week weight‐bearing programme, a quadriceps muscle strengthening exercise programme and electrical stimulation aimed at alleviating pain. Single trials found no significant improvement in mobility from, respectively, a treadmill gait retraining programme, 12 weeks of resistance training, and 16 weeks of weight‐bearing exercise. One trial testing ambulation started within 48 hours of surgery found contradictory results. One historic trial found no significant difference in unfavourable outcomes for weight bearing started at two versus 12 weeks. Of two trials evaluating more intensive physiotherapy regimens, one found no difference in recovery, the other reported a higher level of drop‐out in the more intensive group. Two trials tested electrical stimulation of the quadriceps: one found no benefit and poor tolerance of the intervention; the other found improved mobility and good tolerance. Seven trials evaluated strategies started after hospital discharge. Started soon after discharge, two trials found improved outcome after 12 weeks of intensive physical training and a home‐based physical therapy programme respectively. Begun after completion of standard physical therapy, one trial found improved outcome after six months of intensive physical training, one trial found increased activity levels from a one year exercise programme, and one trial found no significant effects of home‐based resistance or aerobic training. One trial found improved outcome after home‐based exercises started around 22 weeks from injury. One trial found home‐based weight‐bearing exercises starting at seven months produced no significant improvement in mobility. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to establish the best strategies for enhancing mobility after hip fracture surgery.","Interventions aimed at improving and restoring mobility after hip fracture surgery in adults The aim of care after surgery for hip fracture is to get people safely back on their feet and walking again. Initially, people may be asked to rest in bed and restrict weight bearing. Then various strategies to improve mobility, including gait retraining and exercise programmes, are used during hospital stay and often after discharge from hospital. This review includes evidence from 19 trials involving 1589 participants, generally aged over 65 years. Many of the trials had weak methods, including inadequate follow‐up. There was no pooling of data because no two trials were sufficiently alike. Twelve trials evaluated interventions started soon after hip fracture surgery. Single trials found improved mobility from, respectively, a two‐week weight‐bearing programme, a quadriceps muscle strengthening exercise programme and electrical stimulation aimed at alleviating pain. Single trials found no significant improvement in mobility from, respectively, a treadmill gait retraining programme, 12 weeks of resistance training, and 16 weeks of weight‐bearing exercise. One trial testing ambulation started within 48 hours of surgery found contradictory results. One historic trial found no significant difference in unfavourable outcomes for weight bearing started at two versus 12 weeks. Of two trials evaluating more intensive physiotherapy regimens, one found no difference in recovery, the other reported a higher level of drop‐out in the more intensive group. Two trials tested electrical stimulation of the quadriceps: one found no benefit and poor tolerance of the intervention; the other found improved mobility and good tolerance. Seven trials evaluated interventions started after hospital discharge. Started soon after discharge, two trials found improved outcome after 12 weeks of intensive physical training and a home‐based physical therapy programme respectively. Begun after completion of standard physical therapy, one trial found improved outcome after six months of intensive physical training, one trial found increased activity levels from a one year exercise programme, and one trial found no significant effects of home‐based resistance or aerobic training. One trial found improved outcome after home‐based exercises started around 22 weeks from injury. One trial found home‐based weight‐bearing exercises starting at seven months produced no significant improvement in mobility. In summary, the review found there was not enough evidence to determine which are the best strategies, started in hospital or after discharge from hospital, for helping people walk and continue walking after hip fracture surgery.",CD001704
"Background In recent years the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) postoperative pathway in (ileo‐)colorectal surgery, aiming at improving perioperative care and decreasing postoperative complications, has become more common. Objectives We investigated the effectiveness and safety of the ERAS multimodal strategy, compared to conventional care after (ileo‐)colorectal surgery. The primary research question was whether ERAS protocols lead to less morbidity and secondary whether length of stay was reduced. Search methods To answer the research question we entered search strings containing keywords like ""fast track"", ""colorectal and surgery"" and ""enhanced recovery"" into major databases. We also hand searched references in identified reviews concerning ERAS. Selection criteria We included published randomised clinical trials, in any language, comparing ERAS to conventional treatment in patients with (ileo‐) colorectal disease requiring a resection. RCT's including at least 7 ERAS items in the ERAS group and no more than 2 in the conventional arm were included. Data collection and analysis Data of included trials were independently extracted by the reviewers. Analyses were performed using ""REVMAN 5.0.22"". Data were pooled and rate differences as well as weighted mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either fixed or random effects models, depending on heterogeneity (I 2 ). Main results 4 RCTs were included and analysed. Methodological quality of included studies was considered low, when scored according to GRADE methodology. Total numbers of inclusion were limited. The trials included in primary analysis reported 237 patients, (119 ERAS vs 118 conventional). Baseline characteristics were comparable. The primary outcome measure, complications, showed a significant risk reduction for all complications (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72). This difference was not due to reduction in major complications. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the ERAS group (MD ‐2.94 days; 95% CI ‐3.69 to ‐2.19), and readmission rates were equal in both groups. Other outcome parameters were unsuitable for meta‐analysis, but seemed to favour ERAS. Authors' conclusions The quantity and especially quality of data are low. Analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not reduced. Length of stay was reduced significantly. We state that ERAS seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of ERAS as the standard of care. Within ERAS protocols included, no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. Furthermore, protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. Therefore, more specific and large RCT's are needed.","Fast track surgery versus conventional recovery strategies for colorectal surgery Conventionally, recuperation after bowel surgery followed the patients progress. Mobilisation and expansion of diet after surgery was progressed slowly in a stepwise manner following patients progression. This is because it was believed that faster recovery would be unwise. In recent years, however, a new concept has been introduced, called Enhanced Recovery after surgery (ERAS) or fast track. This program, introduced by Kehlet et al, is based on the principle that reducing the body's stress response after surgery reduces the time needed to recuperate. This is achieved by interventions around the operation, involving good information, better feeding before the operation and better pain treatment, so patients can get out of bed earlier and start a normal diet earlier and thereby reducing the risk of complications. This review investigated whether this intervention is safe and whether it is more effective than the traditional treatment. In order to answer this question, 4 randomised trials were found, comparing these two interventions. We found that ERAS can be viewed as safe, i.e. not resulting in more complications or deaths, and at the same time decreases the days spent in hospital following major bowel surgery. However, the data are of low quality and therefore does not justify implementation of ERAS as the standard method of care yet. More research on other outcome parameters like economical evaluation and quality of life parameters are necessary.",CD007635
"Background Acute respiratory infection is a common reason for people to present for medical care. Advice to increase fluid intake is a frequent treatment recommendation. Attributed benefits of fluids include replacing increased insensible fluid losses, correcting dehydration from reduced intake and reducing the viscosity of mucus. However, there are theoretical reasons for increased fluid intake to cause harm. Anti‐diuretic hormone secretion is increased in lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies. This systematic examination of the evidence sought to determine the benefit versus harm from increasing fluid intake. Objectives To answer the following questions. 1. Does recommending increased fluid intake as a treatment for acute respiratory infections improve duration and severity of symptoms?   2. Are there adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in people with acute respiratory infections?   3. Are any benefits or harms related to site of infection (upper or lower respiratory tract) or a different severity of illness? Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2010), EMBASE (1974 to December 2010), Current Contents (2000 to December 2010) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2010). We searched reference lists of articles identified and contacted experts in the relevant disciplines. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of increasing fluid intake in people with acute respiratory infections. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the identified studies to determine eligibility for inclusion. Main results No RCTs assessing the effect of increasing fluid intake in acute respiratory infections were found. Authors' conclusions There is currently no evidence from RCTs for or against the recommendation to increase fluids in acute respiratory infections. The implications for fluid management of acute respiratory infections in the outpatient or primary care setting have not been studied in any RCTs to date. Some non‐experimental (observational) studies report that increasing fluid intake in acute respiratory infections of the lower respiratory tract may cause harm. RCTs need to be done to determine the true effect of this very common medical advice.","Advising patients to increase fluid intake for treating acute respiratory infections Doctors commonly recommend that people with acute respiratory infections drink extra fluids. Acute infections include colds, acute sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza. This review intended to find out the benefit or harm from this recommendation. Potential benefits of fluids are replacing fluid lost because of fever or rapid breathing, treating dehydration and reducing the viscosity of mucus. In infections of the lower part of the respiratory tract, possible harmful effects of fluids might be a dilution of the blood sodium concentration, leading to headache, confusion and seizures. This review found no evidence for or against the use of increased fluids in acute respiratory infections. No randomised controlled trials have been conducted to determine the benefit or harm from extra fluids. It is important that further studies be done in order to determine the true effect of this very common medical advice.",CD004419
"Background Organisational culture is an anthropological metaphor used to inform research and consultancy and to explain organisational environments. Great emphasis has been placed during the last years on the need to change organisational culture in order to pursue effective improvement of healthcare performance. However, the precise nature of organisational culture in healthcare policy often remains underspecified and the desirability and feasibility of strategies to be adopted has been called into question. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of strategies to change organisational culture in order to improve healthcare performance. To examine the effectiveness of these strategies according to different patterns of organisational culture. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, Business and Management, EThOS, Index to Theses, Intute, HMIC, SIGLE, and Scopus until October 2009. The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) was searched for related reviews. We also searched the reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, and we contacted experts in the field for advice on further potential studies. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or well designed quasi‐experimental studies, controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) meeting the quality criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC). Studies should be set in any type of healthcare organisation in which strategies to change organisational culture in order to improve healthcare performance were applied. Our main outcomes were objective measures of professional performance and patient outcome. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently applied the criteria for inclusion and exclusion criteria to scan titles and abstracts and then to screen the full reports of selected citations. At each stage results were compared and discrepancies solved through discussion. Main results The search strategy yielded 4239 records. After the full text assessment, no studies met the quality criteria used by the EPOC Group and evaluated the effectiveness of strategies to change organisational culture to improve healthcare performance. Authors' conclusions It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of strategies to change organisational culture because we found no studies that fulfilled the methodological criteria for this review. Research efforts should focus on strengthening the evidence about the effectiveness of methods to change organisational culture to improve health care performance.","Strategies to change organisational culture to improve healthcare performance 'Organisational culture' refers to the shared characteristics among people within the same organisation. These characteristics may include: beliefs, values, norms of behaviour, routines, traditions, and sense‐making. In the last several years, great emphasis has been placed on changing both organisational culture and organisational structure to improve healthcare performance. While the management of organisational culture is increasingly viewed as a necessary part of health system reform, evidence from the research literature on the link between organisational culture and health performance is weak. Therefore, It is important for policymakers to review the effectiveness of strategies aiming to change organisational culture on healthcare performance. This Cochrane review did not find any rigorous evidence to demonstrate the effect of strategies to change organisational culture on healthcare performance. There are examples (within the excluded studies) of researchers attempting to do this, but well designed studies are lacking.",CD008315
"Background Multiple risk factor interventions using counselling and educational methods assumed to be efficacious and cost‐effective in reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity and that they should be expanded. Trials examining risk factor changes have cast doubt on the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of multiple risk factor interventions for reducing total mortality, fatal and non‐fatal events from CHD and cardiovascular risk factors among adults assumed to be without prior clinical evidence CHD.. Search methods We updated the original search BY SEARCHING CENTRAL (2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (2000 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1998 to June 2006), and checking bibliographies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of more than six months duration using counselling or education to modify more than one cardiovascular risk factor in adults from general populations, occupational groups or specific risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity). Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently. We expressed categorical variables as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where studies published subsequent follow‐up data on mortality and event rates, we updated these data. Main results We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled ORs for total and CHD mortality were 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) and OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were ‐2.71 mmHg (95% CI ‐3.49 to ‐1.93), ‐2.13 mmHg (95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐1.58 ) and ‐0.24 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.16), respectively. The OR for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I 2  > 85%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co‐morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol‐lowering drugs, or by age of trial. Authors' conclusions Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high‐risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.","Multiple risk factor interventions for coronary heart disease In many countries, there is enthusiasm for 'healthy heart programmes' that use counselling and educational methods to encourage people to reduce their risks for developing heart disease. These risk factors include high cholesterol, excessive salt intake, high blood pressure, excess weight, a high‐fat diet, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. This review is an update of all relevant randomised trials that have evaluated an intervention that aimed to reduce more than one risk factor (multiple risk factor intervention) in people without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings are from 55 trials of between six months and 12 years duration conducted in several countries over the course of four decades. The median duration of follow up was 12 months (with a range of six months to 12 years). Multiple risk factor intervention does result in small reductions in risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking. Contrary to expectations, multiple risk factor interventions had little or no impact on the risk of coronary heart disease mortality or morbidity. This could be because these small risk factor changes were not maintained in the long term. Alternatively, the small reductions in risk factors may be caused by biases in some of the studies. The methods of attempting behaviour change in the general population are limited and do not appear to be effective. Different approaches to behaviour change are needed and should be tested empirically before being widely promoted, particularly in developing countries where cardiovascular disease rates are rising. Further trials may be warranted.",CD001561
"Background Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease that results from an IgE‐mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the nasal mucosa to inhaled allergens. It is primarily treated by allergen avoidance and medical treatment, but when these measures fail to control symptoms then surgery to the inferior turbinates of nose is often performed. It is unclear whether these procedures are beneficial in the long term or indeed whether the risks outweigh the benefits. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of inferior turbinate surgery on unrelieved or partially relieved nasal obstruction in patients after maximal medical treatment of proven allergic rhinitis, to compare the results using different surgical techniques and to measure short and long‐term results. Search methods We searched the following databases from their inception for published, unpublished and ongoing trials: the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 2); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; CNKI;  m RCT (Current Controlled Trials); ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform); Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; Google and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. We modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. The date of the most recent search was 6 July 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of inferior turbinate surgery versus continued medical treatment for proven allergic rhinitis, or comparisons between one technique of inferior turbinate surgery versus another technique, after maximal medical treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently screened the search results and assessed the full text of potentially relevant studies. We attempted to contact trial authors for additional information. Main results There were no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the need for randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of inferior turbinate surgery for nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment. Future trials needs to be rigorous in design and delivery, separate adults from paediatric patients, not combine allergic with non‐allergic patients and last long enough to determine long‐term results and complications.","Surgery to the inferior turbinate (lining of the nose) in order to relieve nose block in allergic rhinitis after failed medical treatment Inferior turbinate (lining of nose) surgery is a commonly performed procedure in ENT as shrinking the lining may reduce some of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, particularly nose blockage. This procedure is carried out using a multitude of techniques including cautery, laser and plasma knife. Although unusual, there is the potential for complications such as excessive bleeding and dry nose from these procedures. We set out to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of inferior turbinate surgery compared to continued medical treatment in allergic rhinitis patients in whom medical treatment had failed to relieve symptoms. We also looked for RCTs comparing one technique of turbinate surgery with another. Although our search was extensive, we were not able to find any RCTs which met our inclusion criteria. Research, in the form of properly conducted trials comparing various techniques and assessing long‐term results and complications, has not yet been done in this field. We therefore conclude that the evidence in the literature is not robust enough about the usefulness of surgery using any technique for this condition.",CD005235
"Background Ginseng is a herbal medicine in widespread use throughout the world. Its effect on the brain and nervous system has been investigated. It has been suggested, on the basis of both laboratory and clinical studies, that it may have beneficial effects on cognitive performance. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of ginseng given to improve cognitive performance in healthy participants, participants with cognitive impairment or dementia. To highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 24 February 2009 using the following terms: ginseng* OR panax OR ginsan OR ""Jen Shen""OR shinseng OR Renshen OR schinseng OR ninjin OR gingilone OR panaxoside* OR ginsenoside* OR protopanaxa* OR protopanaxadiol OR protopanaxatriol OR panaxagin OR ginsenol OR ginsenine and terms for dementia and cognition. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All double‐blind and single‐blind randomized, placebo controlled trials assessing the effects of ginseng on cognitive function were eligible for inclusion. Interventions were considered to be ginseng if they were compounds containing ginseng or active agents of the Panax genus as the major component. Data collection and analysis Characteristics of each included trial were extracted independently by two reviewers using a self‐developed data extraction form and entered into RevMan 5.0 software. Authors of identified trials were contacted for additional information and unpublished data. The effects of ginseng in healthy participants, participants with cognitive impairment or dementia were addressed independently. Main results Nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Eight trials enrolled healthy participants, and one was of subjects with age‐associated memory impairment (AAMI). Only five of the identified trials had extractable information and were included in the analysis. Four studies investigated the effects of ginseng extract and one assessed the efficacy of ginseng compound HT008‐1. All of these trials investigated the effects of ginseng on healthy participants. Pooling the data was impossible owing to heterogeneity in outcome measures, trial duration, and ginseng dosage. Results of the analysis suggested improvement of some aspects of cognitive function, behavior and quality of life. No serious adverse events associated with ginseng were found. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is a lack of convincing evidence to show a cognitive enhancing effect of Panax ginseng in healthy participants and no high quality evidence about its efficacy in patients with dementia. Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel group trials with large sample sizes are needed to further investigate the effect of ginseng on cognition in different populations, including dementia patients.","No convincing evidence of a cognitive enhancing effect of Panax ginseng. Ginseng has been used to treat disease and to combat aging for thousands of years. Currently, ginseng occupies a prominent position in the herbal ""best‐sellers"" list and is the most widely used herbal product throughout the world. This review aimed to identify all double‐blind and single‐blind randomized, placebo‐controlled trials assessing the effects of ginseng on cognitive function. Five trials investigating the effects of ginseng on healthy participants had extractable information for efficacy and were included in the review. Ginseng appeared to have some beneficial effects on cognition, behavior and quality of life. More rigorously designed studies are needed on this important issue.",CD007769
"Background The management of advanced oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers is problematic and has traditionally relied on surgery and radiotherapy, both of which are associated with substantial adverse effects. Radiotherapy has been in use since the 1950s and has traditionally been given as single daily doses. This method of dividing up the total dose, or fractionation, has been modified over the years and a variety of approaches have been developed with the aim of improving survival whilst maintaining acceptable toxicity. Objectives To determine which radiotherapy regimens for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers result in increased overall survival, disease free survival, progression free survival and locoregional control. Search methods The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 July 2010), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 July 2010) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 July 2010). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared two or more radiotherapy regimens, radiotherapy versus other treatment modality, or the addition of radiotherapy to other treatment modalities. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was undertaken independently by two or more authors. Study authors were contacted for additional information as required. Adverse events data were collected from published trials. Main results 30 trials involving 6535 participants were included. Seventeen trials compared some form of altered fractionation (hyperfractionation/accelerated) radiotherapy with conventional radiotherapy; three trials compared different altered fractionation regimens; one trial compared timing of radiotherapy, five trials evaluated neutron therapy and four trials evaluated the addition of pre‐operative radiotherapy. Pooling trials of any altered fractionation radiotherapy compared to a conventional schedule showed a statistically significant reduction in total mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.98). In addition, a statistically significant difference in favour of the altered fractionation was shown for the outcome of locoregional control (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89). No statistically significant difference was shown for disease free survival. No statistically significant difference was shown for any other comparison. Authors' conclusions Altered fractionation radiotherapy is associated with an improvement in overall survival and locoregional control in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. More accurate methods of reporting adverse events are needed in order to truly assess the clinical performance of different radiotherapy regimens.","Interventions for the treatment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer: radiotherapy Oral cavity (mouth) cancer is usually detected earlier and treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Oropharyngeal (throat) cancer may be at an advanced stage when it is found and is treated with radiotherapy. Both surgery and radiotherapy may be associated with disfigurement and decreased ability to eat, drink and talk. Recent advances show that by altering how the radiotherapy is given to patients, improvements in overall survival can be achieved. The new methods of giving radiotherapy are called accelerated fractionation or hyperfractionation. However, they may be associated with an increase in side effects.",CD006387
"Background Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in 20% to 55% of haemodialysis sessions and is more frequent among patients on long‐term haemodialysis. Symptomatic IDH is generally defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 10 mm Hg or a systolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, with symptoms such as cramps, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. IDH is managed acutely by volume expansion through the intravenous administration of fluids. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of volume expansion with human albumin, alone or in combination with crystalloid or non‐protein colloids, for treating IDH in haemodialysis patients. Search methods The Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 9) MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2009), and EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2009) were searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs as well as randomised crossover studies were to be included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Relative risk (RR) was to be used to analyse dichotomous variables and mean difference (MD) used to analyse continuous variables. Main results One double blind randomised crossover trial met the inclusion criteria and compared 5% albumin to normal saline in patients with a previous history of IDH. Results from 45 assessable participants did not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference between 5% albumin and normal saline in the primary outcome measure of percentage target ultrafiltration achieved, nor in 11/12 secondary outcomes. Additional (unblinded) saline was given less often when 5% albumin was used compared with saline (16% versus 36%, P = 0.04). However, the volume of additional fluid administered was similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in the nursing time required to treat IDH and the time to restore BP. Authors' conclusions No randomised or controlled trial was identified comparing albumin to crystalloids (other than normal saline) or non‐protein colloids, or a combination of both, in the treatment of symptomatic hypotension during dialysis. One double blind crossover RCT in 45 assessable patients showed that 5% albumin is not superior to normal saline for the treatment of symptomatic hypotension in maintenance haemodialysis patients with a previous history of IDH. Given the cost and relative rarity of albumin use compared to saline, saline should be first line of therapy for treatment of IDH in stable dialysis patients .","Human albumin for hypotension in haemodialysis patients Intradialytic hypotension (IDH), which is caused by a decrease in blood volume, is a common complication of haemodialysis treatment. It is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure with symptoms of nausea, sweating, cramping, or dizziness and causes much discomfort to the patient. IDH is managed by giving fluids to the patient. These can include saline, albumin or other fluids such as gelatins and starches. Because albumin is a relatively rare and expensive blood product, we asked if albumin had an advantage over other fluids to treat IDH. We found one trial comparing albumin to normal saline; no trials were found comparing albumin to other fluids used to treat hypotension. This trial showed no difference between albumin and normal saline in all outcomes except for the amount of additional saline given, which was less in the group treated with albumin. We concluded that normal saline should be the first choice for treating IDH.",CD006758
"Background There are high expectations regarding the potential for the communication of DNA‐based disease risk estimates to motivate behaviour change. Objectives To assess the effects of communicating DNA‐based disease risk estimates on risk‐reducing behaviours and motivation to undertake such behaviours. Search methods We searched the following databases using keywords and medical subject headings: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library,  Issue 4 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), PsycINFO (1985 to April 2010) using OVID SP, and CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to April 2010). We also searched reference lists, conducted forward citation searches of potentially eligible articles and contacted authors of relevant studies for suggestions. There were no language restrictions. Unpublished or in press articles were eligible for inclusion. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving adults (aged 18 years and over) in which one group received actual (clinical studies) or imagined (analogue studies) personalised DNA‐based disease risk estimates for diseases for which the risk could plausibly be reduced by behavioural change. Eligible studies had to include a primary outcome measure of risk‐reducing behaviour or motivation (e.g. intention) to alter such behaviour. Data collection and analysis Two review authors searched for studies and independently extracted data. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For continuous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs). For dichotomous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as odds ratios (ORs). We obtained pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random effects model applied on the scale of standardised differences and log odds ratios. Main results We examined 5384 abstracts and identified 21 studies as potentially eligible. Following a full text analysis, we included 14 papers reporting results of 7 clinical studies (2 papers report on the same trial) and 6 analogue studies. Of the seven clinical studies, five assessed smoking cessation. Meta‐analyses revealed no statistically significant effects on either short‐term (less than 6 months) smoking cessation (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.39, P = 0.31, n = 3 studies) or cessation after six months (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78, P = 0.80, n = 4 studies). Two clinical studies assessed diet and found effects that significantly favoured DNA‐based risk estimates (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.27, P = 0.01). No statistically significant effects were found in the two studies assessing physical activity (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.80, P = 0.92) or the one study assessing medication or vitamin use aimed at reducing disease risks (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.72, P = 0.56).  For the six non‐clinical analogue studies, meta‐analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of DNA‐based risk on intention to change behaviour (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29, P = 0.01). There was no evidence that communicating DNA‐based disease risk estimates had any unintended adverse effects. Two studies that assessed fear arousal immediately after the presentation of risk information did, however, report greater fear arousal in the DNA‐based disease risk estimate groups compared to comparison groups. The quality of included studies was generally poor. None of the clinical or analogue studies were considered to have a low risk of bias, due to either a lack of clarity in reporting, or where details were reported, evidence of a failure to sufficiently safeguard against the risk of bias. Authors' conclusions Mindful of the weak evidence based on a small number of studies of limited quality, the results of this review suggest that communicating DNA‐based disease risk estimates has little or no effect on smoking and physical activity. It may have a small effect on self‐reported diet and on intentions to change behaviour. Claims that receiving DNA‐based test results motivates people to change their behaviour are not supported by evidence. Larger and better‐quality RCTs are needed.","Does communicating DNA‐based risk estimates motivate people to change their behaviour? Tests can now be conducted in which DNA is analysed to estimate the chance of developing diseases such as heart disease or lung cancer in smokers.  It was thought that risk estimates derived from these genetic tests may motivate people to change their behaviour in order to reduce the identified risks. In the current review, we assessed the effect of communicating disease risk estimates from genetic tests on risk‐reducing behaviours and motivation to undertake such behaviours. A systematic search located 14 papers reporting the results of 13 eligible studies: seven clinical studies and six analogue studies (studies in which participants are given hypothetical scenarios asking them to imagine receiving genetic test based disease risk estimates). Five clinical studies assessed smoking cessation, with statistical combination of the results revealing no statistically significant effects on smoking cessation in either the short‐term (< six months) or long term (> six months). Two clinical studies assessed dietary behaviour and showed that communicating genetic test‐based risk estimates did change people's behaviour . The two studies assessing physical activity and the one study assessing medication or vitamin use aimed at reducing disease risks did not show that communicating DNA‐based disease risk estimates had an effect on behaviour. For the six analogue studies, statistical combination of the results revealed a statistically significant effect of genetic test based disease risk estimates on intention to change behaviour only. There was no evidence of any unintended detrimental effects on motivation or mood. In summary, the limited amount and quality of evidence currently available suggests that communicating genetic test based disease risk estimates may have little or no effect on behaviour, but may have a small effect on intentions to change behaviour. Larger and better quality trials are needed.",CD007275
"Background Methotrexate (MTX) is among the most effective disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with less toxicity and better tolerability. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MTX monotherapy compared to MTX combination with non‐biologic DMARDs in adult with RA. Search methods Trials were identified in MEDLINE (1950 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), the Cochrane Controlled trials Registry (CENTRAL) (up to 2009), the American and European scientific meeting abstracts 2005‐9, the reference lists of all relevant studies, letters, and review articles. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing MTX monotherapy versus MTX combined with other non‐biologic DMARDs of at least 12 weeks of trial duration in adult RA patients. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies,extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias of relevant studies.The efficacy analysis was stratified into 3 groups based on previous DMARDs use: DMARD naive, MTX inadequate response, and non‐MTX DMARDs inadequate response. The toxicity analysis was stratified by DMARD combination and pooled across trials for each combination. Our prespecified primary analysis was based on total withdrawal rates for efficacy or toxicity. Main results A total of 19 trials (2,025 patients) from 6,938 citations were grouped by the type of patients randomised. Trials in DMARD naive patients showed no significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy; withdrawals for lack of efficacy or toxicity were similar in both groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% CI.0.70 to 1.93, absolute risk difference(ARD) 5%, 95%CI‐3% to 13%). Trials in MTX or non‐MTX DMARDs inadequate responder patients also showed no difference in withdrawal rates between the MTX combo versus mono groups with RR 0.86 95% CI 0.49 to1.51, ARD ‐2 %, 95% CI‐13 % to 8 % and RR 0.75 95% CI 0.41 to 1.35, ARD ‐10%, 95% CI ‐31% to 11%, respectively. Significant reductions of pain and improvement in physical function (measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire or HAQ) were found in the MTX combination group, but only in MTX‐inadequate responders (absolute risk difference ‐9.72%, 95%CI ‐14.7% to ‐4.75% for pain and mean difference (MD) ‐0.28, 95%CI ‐0.36 to ‐0.21 (0‐3) for HAQ). Authors' conclusions When the balance of efficacy and toxicity is taken into account, the moderate level of evidence from our systematic review showed no statistically significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy. Trials are needed that compare currently used MTX doses and combination therapies.","Methotrexate alone versus methotrexate in combination with other medications for rheumatoid arthritis This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of methotrexate in combination with other drugs compared to methotrexate alone for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate? When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move.  Drugs such as methotrexate also aim to help prevent permanent damage to your joints that can happen if RA is not treated.  Methotrexate is a Disease‐Modifying Anti‐Rheumatic Drug (DMARD).  Methotrexate may treat rheumatoid arthritis by decreasing the activity of the immune system. Methotrexate is a common treatment for RA and may be prescribed in combination with other drugs, especially in people who are not improving on methotrexate alone. DMARDs like methotrexate come as tablets, capsules and, in some cases, injections. What the research says There is probably little or no difference in symptoms of RA when taking methotrexate in combination with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or methotrexate alone. There may be slightly more side effects when taking methotrexate in combination with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) than methotrexate alone. Side effects may include stomach problems, liver problems, anaemia or infection. In people who never took DMARDs before, 16 out of 100 stopped taking methotrexate because of harmful effects or no benefit 19 out of 100 (12 to 32) stopped taking methotrexate in combination with another DMARD In people who did not improve with methotrexate, 19 out of 100 stopped taking methotrexate because of harmful effects or no benefit 16 out of 100 (9 to 28) stopped taking methotrexate in combination with another DMARD In people who did not improve with other DMARDs, 35 out of 100 stopped taking methotrexate because of harmful effects or no benefit 26 out of 100 (14 to 47) stopped taking methotrexate in combination with another DMARD Overall, 9 out of 100 people stopped taking methotrexate because of side effects 14 out of 100 (10 to 18) stopped taking methotrexate in combination with another DMARD",CD008495
"Background Chiropractors commonly use a combination of interventions to treat people with low‐back pain (LBP). Objectives To determine the effects of combined chiropractic interventions (that is, a combination of therapies, other than spinal manipulation alone) on pain, disability, back‐related function, overall improvement, and patient satisfaction in adults with LBP, aged 18 and older. Search methods We searched: The Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register (May 2009), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2009, Issue 2), and MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINAHL (from January 1982), MANTIS (from Inception) and the Index to Chiropractic Literature (from Inception) to May 2009. We also screened references of identified articles and contacted chiropractic researchers. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing the use of combined chiropractic interventions (rather than spinal manipulation alone) with no treatment or other therapies. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data using standardised forms. Both descriptive synthesis and meta‐analyses were performed. Main results We included 12 studies involving 2887 participants with LBP. Three studies had low risk of bias. Included studies evaluated a range of chiropractic procedures in a variety of sub‐populations of people with LBP. No trials were located of combined chiropractic interventions compared to no treatment. For acute and subacute LBP, chiropractic interventions improved short‐ and medium‐term pain (SMD ‐0.25 (95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.04) and MD ‐0.89 (95%CI ‐1.60 to ‐0.18)) compared to other treatments, but there was no significant difference in long‐term pain (MD ‐0.46 (95% CI ‐1.18 to 0.26)). Short‐term improvement in disability was greater in the chiropractic group compared to other therapies (SMD ‐0.36 (95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.02)). However, the effect was small and all studies contributing to these results had high risk of bias. There was no difference in medium‐ and long‐term disability. No difference was demonstrated for combined chiropractic interventions for chronic LBP and for studies that had a mixed population of LBP. Authors' conclusions Combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short‐term and pain in the medium‐term for acute and subacute LBP. However, there is currently no evidence that supports or refutes that these interventions provide a clinically meaningful difference for pain or disability in people with LBP when compared to other interventions. Future research is very likely to change the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results.","Combined chiropractic interventions for low‐back pain Low‐back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. About 80% of the population will experience low‐back pain at some time in their lives. Many people with low‐back pain seek the care of a chiropractor. For this review, chiropractic was defined as encompassing a combination of therapies such as spinal manipulation, massage, heat and cold therapies, electrotherapies, the use of mechanical devices, exercise programs, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification and patient education. The review did not look at studies where chiropractic was defined as spinal manipulation alone as this has been reviewed elsewhere and is not necessarily reflective of actual clinical practice. Non‐specific low‐back pain indicates that no specific cause is detectable, such as infection, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fracture, inflammatory process or radicular syndrome (pain, tingling or numbness spreading down the leg).Twelve randomised trials (including 2887 participants) assessing various combinations of chiropractic care for low‐back pain were included in this review, but only three of these studies were considered to have a low risk of bias. The review shows that while combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute and subacute low‐back pain, there is currently no evidence to support or refute that combined chiropractic interventions provide a clinically meaningful advantage over other treatments for pain or disability in people with low‐back pain. Any demonstrated differences were small and were only seen in studies with a high risk of bias. Future research is very likely to change the results and our confidence in them. Well conducted randomised trials are required that compare combined chiropractic interventions to other established therapies for low‐back pain.",CD005427
"Background Emergency sclerotherapy is still widely used as a first line therapy for variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, particularly when banding ligation is not available or feasible. However, pharmacological treatment may stop bleeding in the majority of these patients. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis. Search methods Search of trials was based on  The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register , the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  ( CENTRAL ) in  The Cochrane Library ,  MEDLINE ,  EMBASE , and  Science Citation Index Expanded  through January 2010. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs (vasopressin (with or without nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Data collection and analysis Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five‐day treatment failure, rebleeding, mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events. Data were analysed by a random‐effects model according to the vasoactive treatment. Sensitivity analyses included combined analysis of all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, type of publication, and risk of bias. Main results Seventeen trials including 1817 patients were identified. Vasoactive drugs were vasopressin (one trial), terlipressin (one trial), somatostatin (five trials), and octreotide (ten trials). No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcome. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, the risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were failure to control bleeding ‐0.02 (‐0.06 to 0.02), five‐day failure rate ‐0.05 (‐0.10 to 0.01), rebleeding 0.01 (‐0.03 to 0.05), mortality (17 randomised trials, 1817 patients) ‐0.02 (‐0.06 to 0.02), and transfused blood units (8 randomised trials, 849 patients) (weighted mean difference) ‐0.24 (‐0.54 to 0.07). Adverse events 0.08 (0.03 to 0.14) and serious adverse events 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08) were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy. Authors' conclusions We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs. Vasoactive drugs may be safe and effective whenever endoscopic therapy is not promptly available and seems to be associated with less adverse events than emergency sclerotherapy. Other meta‐analyses and guidelines advocate that combined vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy is superior to either intervention alone.","Emergency sclerotherapy is not better than pharmacological therapy for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis Variceal bleeding in cirrhosis is associated with a high risk of death. Although banding ligation of varices is considered the choice for endoscopic treatment, emergency sclerotherapy is frequently used particularly where ligation is not available or when it is not feasible. However, vasoactive drugs stop bleeding in most patients, and emergency sclerotherapy may carry risks to the patient and is more demanding on the health‐care system. All of the identified randomised clinical trials comparing emergency sclerotherapy with vasopressin (+/‐ intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide have been reviewed. A total of 17 randomised trials including 1817 patients were included. Sclerotherapy did not appear to be superior to the vasoactive drugs in terms of control of bleeding, number of transfusions, 42‐day rebleeding and mortality, or rebleeding and mortality before other elective treatments. However, adverse events were significantly more frequent and severe with sclerotherapy than with vasoactive drugs.",CD002233
"Background There is an increased risk of depression in people with a physical illness. Depression is associated with reduced treatment adherence, poor prognosis, increased disability and higher mortality in many physical illnesses. Antidepressants are effective in the treatment of depression in physically healthy populations, but there is less clarity regarding their use in physically ill patients. This review updates Gill’s Cochrane review (2000), which found that antidepressants were effective for depression in physical illness. Since Gill there have been a number of larger trials assessing the efficacy of antidepressants in this context. Objectives To determine the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in patients with a physical illness. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) trial registers were conducted together with supplementary searches of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the standard bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Reference lists of included studies were scanned and trials registers were searched to identify additional unpublished data. Last searches were run in December 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of antidepressants and placebo in the treatment of depression in adults with a physical illness. Depression included diagnoses of Major Depression, Adjustment Disorder and Dysthymia based on standardised criteria. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was efficacy 6‐8 weeks after randomisation. Data were also extracted at three additional time‐points (4‐5 weeks, 9‐18 weeks, >18 weeks). Acceptability and tolerability were assessed by comparing the number of drop‐outs and adverse events. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous data (response to treatment). Standardised mean differences with 95% CI were calculated for continuous data (mean depression score). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Main results Fifty‐one studies including 3603 participants were included in the review. Forty‐four studies including 3372 participants contributed data towards the efficacy analyses. Pooled efficacy data for the primary outcome provided an OR of 2.33, CI 1.80‐3.00, p<0.00001 (25 studies, 1674 patients) favouring antidepressants. Antidepressants were also more efficacious than placebo at the other time‐points. At 6‐8 weeks, fewer patients receiving placebo dropped out compared to patients treated with an antidepressant. Dry mouth and sexual dysfunction were more common in patients treated with an antidepressant. Authors' conclusions This review provides evidence that antidepressants are superior to placebo in treating depression in physical illness. However, it is likely that publication and reporting biases exaggerated the effect sizes obtained. Further research is required to determine the comparative efficacy and acceptability of particular antidepressants in this population.","Antidepressants for depression in physically ill people Depression in physical illness is common. Antidepressants have been shown to improve depression in people who are physically healthy, but there has been doubt about whether they are appropriate for people who are physically ill. This review examined clinical trials of antidepressants in physically ill people to determine whether antidepressants help these patients, and in particular if they lessen depression. We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane to identify and select studies and to collect and analyse the information. We extracted information on fifty‐one studies in the review. Our results found that antidepressants are better than a placebo (inactive) drug in treating depression in physically ill people. Both the two main classes of antidepressant, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were shown to be more effective than a placebo. Antidepressants improved depressive symptoms within 4‐5 weeks of treatment, and this benefit persisted after 18 weeks. However, patients taking an antidepressant were more likely to experience sexual dysfunction and dry mouth, and were more likely to stop taking their medication after 6‐8 weeks of treatment. There are no grounds to recommend one antidepressant over another on the basis of this review. We conclude that antidepressants appear to be useful in treating depression and should be considered for physically ill patients. The decision to prescribe antidepressants should take account of patients' preferences, symptoms, and possible interactions with other medicines they are taking.",CD007503
"Background Patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are treated by three different techniques of cholecystectomy: open, small‐incision, or laparoscopic. There is no overview on Cochrane systematic reviews on these three interventions. Objectives To summarise Cochrane reviews that assess the effects of different techniques of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Methods The  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  (CDSR) was searched for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the treatment of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (Issue 4, 2009). Main results Three systematic reviews that included a total of 56 randomised trials with 5246 patients are included in this overview of reviews. All three reviews used identical inclusion criteria for trials and participants, and identical methodological assessments. Laparoscopic versus small‐incision cholecystectomy    Thirteen trials with 2337 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was relatively low. There was no significant difference regarding mortality or complications. Total complications of laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy were high, ie, 17.0% and 17.5%. Total complications (risk difference, random‐effects model ‐0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.07 to 0.05)), hospital stay (mean difference (MD), random‐effects ‐0.72 days (95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.04)), and convalescence were not significantly different. Trials with low risk of bias showed a quicker operative time for small‐incision cholecystectomy (MD, low risk of bias considering 'blinding', random‐effects model 16.4 minutes (95% CI 8.9 to 23.8)) while trials with high risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference. Laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy    Thirty‐eight trials with 2338 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐3 days (95% CI ‐3.9 to ‐2.3)) and convalescence (MD, random‐effects model ‐22.5 days (95% CI ‐36.9 to ‐8.1)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding mortality, complications, and operative time. Small‐incision versus open cholecystectomy    Seven trials with 571 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Small‐incision cholecystectomy had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐2.8 days (95% CI ‐4.9 to ‐0.6)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding complications and operative time. Authors' conclusions No statistically significant differences in the outcome measures of mortality and complications have been found among open, small‐incision, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no data on symptom relief. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are high. The quicker recovery of both laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy patients compared with patients on open cholecystectomy justifies the existing preferences for both minimal invasive techniques over open cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomies seem to be comparable, but the latter has a significantly shorter operative time, and seems to be less costly.","Open, small‐incision, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy seem comparable with regard to mortality and complications Gallstones are one of the major causes of morbidity in western society. Prevalence of persons with asymptomatic and symptomatic gallstones varies between 5% and 22%. There is consensus that only patients with symptomatic gallstones need treatment. Three different operation techniques for removal of the gallbladder exist: the classical open operation technique and two minimally invasive procedures, the laparoscopic and the small‐incision technique. This overview evaluates the three surgical procedures and comprises fifty‐six trials with 5246 patients randomised. Complication proportions in all three techniques are high, but there seem to be no significant differences in mortality and complications between the three operation techniques. Both minimally invasive techniques have advantages over the open operation considering postoperative recovery. This overview of three Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group systematic reviews shows that the laparoscopic and the small‐incision operation should be considered equal regarding patient‐relevant outcomes (mortality, complications, hospital stay, and convalescence). Operative time seems to be quicker and costs seem to be lower using the small‐incision technique. The question today is why the laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard treatment of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis without the evidence being present. We were unable to find any arguments supporting the 'gold standard' status of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In future trials, research should concentrate more on outcomes that are relevant to patients (eg, complications and symptom relief). Furthermore, the execution of the trials should comply with CONSORT requirements (www.consort‐statement.org).",CD008318
"Background Antithyroid drugs are widely used in the therapy of hyperthyroidism. There are wide variations in the dose, regimen or duration of treatment used by health professionals. Objectives To assess the effects of dose, regimen and duration of antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Search methods We searched seven databases and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of antithyroid medication for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Pooling of data for primary outcomes, and select exploratory analyses were undertaken. Main results Twenty‐six randomised trials involving 3388 participants were included. Overall the quality of trials, as reported, was poor. None of the studies investigated incidence of hypothyroidism, changes in weight, health‐related quality of life, ophthalmopathy progression or economic outcomes. Four trials examined the effect of duration of therapy on relapse rates, and when using the titration regimen 12 months was superior to six months, but there was no benefit in extending treatment beyond 18 months. Twelve trials examined the effect of block‐replace versus titration block‐regimens. The relapse rates were similar in both groups at 51% in the block‐replace group and 54% in the titration block‐group (OR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to1.08) though adverse effects (rashes (10% versus 6%) and withdrawing due to side effects (16% versus 9%)) were significantly higher in the block‐replace group. Three studies considered the addition of thyroxine with continued low dose antithyroid therapy after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies and the difference between the two groups was not significant (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21). Four studies considered the addition of thyroxine alone after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was no significant difference in the relapse rates between the groups after 12 months follow‐up (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.67). Two studies considered the addition of immunosuppressive agents. The results which were in favour of the interventions would need to be validated in other populations. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the titration regimen is 12 to 18 months. The titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the block‐replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective. Continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Immunosuppressive therapies need further evaluation.","Antithyroid drug regimen for treating Graves' hyperthyroidism People who have Graves' hyperthyroidism have thyroid glands which are releasing too much thyroid hormone. This can cause goitres (swelling in the neck around the thyroid gland), sweating, bowel or menstrual problems, and other, especially eye symptoms (ophthalmopathy). Treatments include anti‐thyroid drugs, surgery or radiation to reduce thyroid tissue. There are several choices to be made when considering the drug treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism including the choice of drug, dose, duration of therapy, addition of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) and when to discontinue therapy. The antithyroid drugs which were used in the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comprised carbimazole, propylthiouracil and methimazole. Twenty‐six RCTs involving 3388 participants were identified. The majority of participants in all the studies were female (83% in the studies reporting sex distribution). The mean age was 40 years. The duration of follow up was between two to five years in eleven trials. In high dose ('block‐replace') versus low dose ('titration') studies the duration of therapy was six months in two studies, 18 months in four studies and 12 months in the remaining trials. The main outcome was the relapse rate of hyperthyroidism over one year after completion of drug treatment and this was the primary outcome in all the studies assessed. There were no deaths reported in any of the studies. None of the studies detailed incidence of hypothyroidism, changes in weight during the course of therapy, health‐related quality of life, ophthalmopathy progression or economic outcomes. The evidence (based on four studies) suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the low dose regimen is 12 to 18 months. The low dose regimen had fewer adverse effects than the high dose regimen and was no less effective in trials (based on 12 trials) of equal duration. Continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Studies using immunosuppressive agents need further validation of safety and efficacy in controlled trials among different populations. Data regarding side effects and number of participants withdrawn from therapy due to side effects were available in seven studies. The number of participants reporting rashes was significantly higher in the high versus low dose group (10% versus 6%). The number of participants withdrawing due to side effects were also significantly higher in the high versus low dose group (16% versus 9%).",CD003420
"Background Total knee replacement has been demonstrated to be one of the most successful procedures in the treatment of osteoarthritis. However quadriceps weakness and reductions in function are commonly reported following surgery. Recently Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) has been used as an adjunct to traditional strengthening programmes. This review considers the effectiveness of NMES as a means of increasing quadriceps strength in patients before and after total knee replacement. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of NMES as a means of improving quadriceps strength before and after total knee replacement. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 1 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 week 2), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)(1982 to 2007/11), AMED (1985 to Jan 2008), Web of Science, and Pedro (Jan 2008) (http://www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au/index.html) for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. The electronic search was complimented by hand searches and experts in the area and companies supplying NMES equipment were also contacted. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were accepted that used NMES for the purpose of quadriceps strengthening either pre or post total knee replacement. Data collection and analysis Two review authors decided which studies were suitable for inclusion based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the protocol and the data was extracted using pre‐developed data extraction forms. Two review authors (BM and BC) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using a descriptive approach as advocated by the Musculoskeletal group. Only two studies were included in the review. Neither study presented results in a form suitable for meta‐analysis. The authors of both studies were contacted to obtain the raw data but they were no longer available.The data from both studies are described in the review. Main results Two studies were identified for inclusion in the review. No significant differences were reported in either study for maximum voluntary isometric torque or endurance between the NMES group and the control group but significantly better quadriceps muscle activation was reported in the exercise and neuromuscular stimulation group compared with the exercise group alone in the second study. This difference was significant at the mid training (six week) time point but not at the twelfth week post training time point. Further analysis of both studies were not possible due to the absence of raw data scores. Both studies carried a high risk of bias. Mean values were not given for strength, endurance, cross sectional area or quality of life. Pain outcomes, patient satisfaction or adverse effects were not reported in either study. The results were presented as percentage improvements from baseline and the number of subjects in each group was unclear. Authors' conclusions The studies found in this review do not permit any conclusions to be made about the application of neuromuscular stimulation for the purposes of quadriceps strengthening before or after total knee replacement. At this time the evidence for the use of neuromuscular stimulation for the purposes of quadriceps strengthening in this patient group is unclear.","Electrical stimulation for thigh muscle strengthening before and after knee replacement surgery This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know about the effect of electrical stimulation as a treatment to improve the strength of the thigh muscles before and after  knee replacement surgery.   The review shows that  we are uncertain whether electrical stimulation affects thigh muscle strength before and after knee replacement surgery because of the very low quality of the evidence.   What is thigh muscle weakness and what is electrical stimulation? Osteoarthritis of the knee can make the knee joint painful and unstable.  Knee replacement surgery is a treatment that can sometimes help this condition.   One side effect of having knee surgery, is that people can lose strength in their thigh muscles.  When your thigh muscles are weak, it can be difficult to stand from a sitting position.  Up to a year later, some people walk and climb stairs more slowly than they did before surgery.  Electrical stimulation means using electricity to make the thigh muscle contract,  just as it would if a person were exercising.  Electrodes are wires that send the electrical current from a small machine to your thigh muscle.  Usually, a doctor or physiotherapist will connect electrodes with tape to the skin on your thigh.  The treatment is usually given as part of an overall exercise program.",CD007177
"Background Imaging is commonly performed for musculoskeletal conditions. Identifying interventions to improve the appropriate use of imaging for musculoskeletal conditions could potentially result in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced health care costs. Objectives To determine the effects of interventions that aim to improve the appropriate use of imaging for people with musculoskeletal conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (June 2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2007) and CINAHL (January 1982 to June 2007). We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We undertook citation searches of all included studies, contacted authors of included studies, and contacted other experts in the field of effective professional practice. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, non‐randomised controlled clinical trials and interrupted time‐series analyses that evaluated interventions designed to improve the use of imaging for musculoskeletal symptoms. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Twenty eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were for the management of osteoporosis or low back pain, and most evaluated interventions aimed at health professionals. To improve the use of imaging in the management of osteoporosis, the effect of any type of intervention compared to no‐intervention controls was modest (absolute improvement in bone mineral density test ordering +10%, IQR 0.0 to +27.7). Patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions appeared to have most potential for improving imaging use in osteoporosis. For low back pain studies, the most common intervention evaluated was distribution of educational materials and this showed varying effects. Other interventions in low back pain studies also showed variable effects. For other musculoskeletal conditions, distribution of educational materials, educational meetings and audit and feedback were not shown to be effective for changing imaging ordering behaviour. Across all conditions, increasing the number of intervention components did not increase effect. Authors' conclusions For improving the use of imaging in osteoporosis, most professional interventions demonstrated benefit, and patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions appeared to have most potential for benefit. For low back pain studies interventions showed varying effects. For other musculoskeletal conditions, no firm conclusions can be drawn.","Interventions for improving the appropriate use of imaging in people with musculoskeletal conditions Imaging is the production of a clinical image of the human body using medical techniques such as x‐rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance (MRI). Imaging is commonly performed for musculoskeletal conditions and is an important aspect of the management of these conditions. In some instances, imaging may not be appropriate, for example x‐rays for acute low back pain, and in other instances, imaging is under utilised, for example bone mineral density testing to diagnose people at risk for osteoporosis. The identification of interventions that improve the appropriate use of imaging (either decreasing inappropriate use or increasing appropriate use) for musculoskeletal conditions would be of great value, potentially resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare costs. The aim of this systematic review was to identify those interventions that improve appropriate use of imaging and to quantify their effects. Twenty eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies evaluated interventions designed to change health professional behaviour, for example, the distribution of educational materials, reminders to health professionals and patient education. For improving the use of imaging in osteoporosis, most interventions aimed at health professionals demonstrated benefit, and patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions appeared to have most potential for benefit. For low back pain studies, the most common intervention evaluated was distribution of educational materials and this showed varying effects. Other interventions in low back pain studies showed variable effects. For other musculoskeletal conditions, distribution of educational materials, educational meetings and audit and feedback were not shown to be effective for changing imaging ordering behaviour. Across all conditions, increasing the number of intervention components did not result in a larger effect of interventions.",CD006094
"Background Early surfactant reduces mortality and pulmonary complications in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. However, current surfactant administration strategies require endotracheal intubation with or without continued mechanical ventilation. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease (CLD) are associated with mechanical ventilation and potentially life‐long effects. Non‐invasive methods of surfactant administration including intra‐amniotic surfactant may avoid endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, potentially preventing development of CLD. Objectives To determine if intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth, compared to placebo or no treatment or post‐delivery tracheal surfactant instillation, reduces morbidity or mortality, or both, in preterm infants. If intra‐amniotic instillation is effective, in subgroup analysis to determine the effect of 1) gestational age; 2) type of surfactant; 3) dose; 4) timing; 5) indication; and 6) multiple pregnancy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (August 2009), MEDLINE (1950‐August 2009), handsearched the Proceedings of Pediatric Academic Societies (American Pediatric Society, Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Pediatric Research) from 1990‐2009 in Pediatric Research Journal and Abstracts online and the Proceedings of Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand (PSANZ) (1996‐2009). We also searched the Science Citation Index (Web of Science) (August 2009) and checked reference lists of identified studies. We contacted Abbott Laboratories, Inc for unpublished studies. Selection criteria Published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled, cluster‐randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth, compared to placebo or no treatment or post‐delivery tracheal surfactant instillation. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality. Main results We found no trials were found met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions We identified no randomised trials that evaluated the effect of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth. Evidence from animal and observational human studies suggest that intra‐amniotic surfactant administration is potentially safe, feasible and effective. Well designed trials of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth are needed.","Intra‐amniotic surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing respiratory distress in newborns There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide the use of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth.     Respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency of natural lung detergent (surfactant) occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks' gestation). The usual treatment includes instilling artificial surfactant directly into the newborn infant's airway followed by mechanical ventilation. However, this process can lead to lung injury, which can affect the infant's long‐term health. A potential alternative strategy is to inject surfactant into the amniotic fluid around the fetus close to the infant's mouth and nostrils before birth. Preliminary animal and human study suggests that surfactant enters the fetal lungs through fetal breathing efforts. This has the potential to reduce the need to support the infant's breathing after birth, as well as lung damage caused by mechanical ventilation. This review found no randomised controlled trials of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth. In view of the encouraging results from animal studies and preliminary human study, high‐quality studies of intra‐amniotic instillation of surfactant for women at risk of preterm birth are needed.",CD007916
"Background Winging of the scapula is caused by weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles, which allows the scapula to lift off the chest wall during shoulder movements. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (and occasionally in other muscular dystrophies) there is selective weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles which may spare other shoulder muscles such as the deltoid muscle. This imbalance results in significant winging and loss of shoulder function. Historically, a number of different surgical and non‐surgical interventions have been used to achieve scapular stability. This review examines the evidence available for the use of all scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy, especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Objectives To examine the evidence for the relative efficacy of scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy (especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) in improving upper limb function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (20 July 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009) Medline (1966 to July 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2009) for randomised trials. We also contacted authors of trials and other experts in the field. Selection criteria All reports of scapular fixation for muscular dystrophy, including quasi‐randomised or randomised controlled trials, comparing any form of scapular fixation (surgical and non‐surgical) in people (of all ages and of all severity) with scapular winging due to muscular dystrophy. Our primary outcome measure was objective improvement in shoulder abduction. Our secondary outcome measures were: patient‐perceived improvement in performance of activities of daily living, cosmetic results, subjective improvement in pain and proportion of patients with significant postoperative complications. Data collection and analysis We collated and summarised studies on the treatment of scapular winging in muscular dystrophy. Main results No randomised trials were identified. We therefore present a review of the non‐randomised literature available. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the suggestion from observational studies that operative interventions produce significant benefits. However, these have to be balanced against postoperative immobilisation, need for physiotherapy and potential complications. We conclude that a randomised trial would be difficult, but a register of cases and the use of a standardised assessment protocol would allow more accurate comparison of the disparate techniques.","Surgical operations for winging of the shoulder blade in muscular dystrophy Winging of the scapula (shoulder blade) in muscular dystrophy is caused by weakness of the muscles which attach the scapula to the chest and help raise the arms. Non‐surgical interventions involve casts or slings to support the shoulders. Surgical operations involve fixing the scapulae to the ribs using screws or wire. No randomised controlled trials were found. Small case series suggest that surgical operations might produce significant benefits in some people. These need to be balanced against loss of mobility, need for physiotherapy and possible complications including failure of the fixing material or reduced breathing capacity.",CD003278
"Background Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver‐related morbidity and mortality. A high proportion of patients never experience symptoms. Peginterferon plus ribavirin is the recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C. However, ribavirin monotherapy may be considered for some patients. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of ribavirin monotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Search methods We identified trials through electronic databases, manual searches of bibliographies and journals, authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies until March 2009. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status comparing ribavirin versus no intervention, placebo, or interferon for chronic hepatitis C. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome measures were serum sustained virological response (loss of hepatitis C virus RNA at least six months after treatment), liver‐related morbidity plus all‐cause mortality, and adverse events. Secondary outcome measures were end of treatment virological response, biochemical response (transaminase activity), and histological response. Randomisation methods, blinding, data handling, and funding were extracted as measures of bias control. Random‐effects and fixed‐effect meta‐analyses were performed for all outcomes. We only present the results of the fixed‐effect model if both models provide the same result regarding statistical significance. We present data as risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included 14 randomised trials with 657 patients. The majority of trials had unclear control of bias. Compared with placebo or no intervention, ribavirin had no significant effect on the sustained virological response (RD 0%, 95% CI ‐2% to 3%, five trials) or end of treatment virological response (RD 0% 95% CI ‐3% to 3%, ten trials). Ribavirin had no significant effect on liver‐related morbidity plus mortality (RD 0%, 95% CI ‐2% to 3%, 11 trials). Ribavirin significantly increased the risk of adverse reactions, including anaemia. Ribavirin significantly improved end of treatment biochemical and histological response but not the sustained biochemical response. Ribavirin was significantly inferior to interferon regarding virological and biochemical responses (five trials). Authors' conclusions Ribavirin seems without beneficial effects on serum virological response and liver‐related morbidity or mortality, and significantly increased the risk of adverse reactions. Ribavirin monotherapy seems significantly inferior to interferon monotherapy. The total number of included patients is small, and more trials are perhaps needed. The use of ribavirin monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C cannot be recommended outside randomised trials.","Treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus Globally, about 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a blood‐borne virus and routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother‐to‐infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high‐risk sexual behaviour, and blood transfusion. Chronic hepatitis C is in most patients a benign viral infection, but a minority of patients develop liver cirrhosis and may suffer from complications due to cirrhosis or die from it. Treatment with interferon clears hepatitis C virus from the blood in about 15% of the patients. Adding ribavirin to interferon (combination therapy) significantly improves the number that clears hepatitis C from the blood to about 40%. Not all patients are tolerant to interferon, and also interferon is costly. This is why ribavirin given as a single drug may be considered as an option for patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review identified 11 randomised trials comparing ribavirin with no antiviral treatment in patient with chronic hepatitis C. Combining the results from all identified trials ribavirin alone seemed without beneficial effects for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, ribavirin given alone was significantly inferior compared with interferon regarding clearing hepatitis C from the blood and regarding reducing liver enzymes activity in the blood. Furthermore, ribavirin given alone increased the risk of anaemia. Thus, ribavirin given alone cannot be recommended, but more trials may be needed.",CD005527
"Background A specific manual‐based form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been developed for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (CBT‐BN) and other common related syndromes such as binge eating disorder. Other psychotherapies and modifications of CBT are also used. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of CBT, CBT‐BN and other psychotherapies in the treatment of adults with bulimia nervosa or related syndromes of recurrent binge eating. Search methods Handsearch of  The International Journal of Eating Disorders  since first issue; database searches of MEDLINE, EXTRAMED, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CURRENT CONTENTS, LILACS, SCISEARCH, CENTRAL and the The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Controlled Trials Register; citation list searching and personal approaches to authors were used. Search date June 2007. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of psychotherapy for adults with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and/or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) of a bulimic type which applied a standardised outcome methodology and had less than 50% drop‐out rate. Data collection and analysis Data were analysed using the Review Manager software program. Relative risks were calculated for binary outcome data. Standardised mean differences were calculated for continuous variable outcome data. A random effects model was applied. Main results 48 studies (n = 3054 participants) were included. The review supported the efficacy of CBT and particularly CBT‐BN in the treatment of people with bulimia nervosa and also (but less strongly due to the small number of trials) related eating disorder syndromes. Other psychotherapies were also efficacious, particularly interpersonal psychotherapy in the longer‐term. Self‐help approaches that used highly structured CBT treatment manuals were promising. Exposure and Response Prevention did not enhance the efficacy of CBT. Psychotherapy alone is unlikely to reduce or change body weight in people with bulimia nervosa or similar eating disorders. Authors' conclusions There is a small body of evidence for the efficacy of CBT in bulimia nervosa and similar syndromes, but the quality of trials is very variable and sample sizes are often small. More and larger trials are needed, particularly for binge eating disorder and other EDNOS syndromes. There is a need to develop more efficacious therapies for those with both a weight and an eating disorder.","Psychological treatments for people with bulimia nervosa and binging Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder in which people binge on food and then try to make up for this by extreme measures such as making themselves sick, taking laxatives or starving themselves. We reviewed studies of psychotherapies, including a specific form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT‐BN). We compared psychotherapy to control groups who got no treatment (e.g. people on waiting lists) and the specific CBT‐BN with other types of psychotherapy. We found that CBT was better than other therapies, and better than no treatment, at reducing binge eating. Other psychotherapies were also better than no treatment in reducing binge eating. Some studies found that self‐help using the CBT manual can be helpful, but more research and larger trials are needed.",CD000562
"Background Multidisciplinary care (MDC) is increasingly thought to be an important means of symptomatic and supportive management for motor neuron disease (MND) but the evidence base for its effectiveness is unclear. This is the first update of a review first published in 2009. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of MDC in adults with MND, especially the types of approaches that are effective (settings, intensity) and the outcomes that are affected. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (5 July 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3, searched 20 July 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), CINAHL Plus (1937 to June 2011), AMED (1985 to June 2011) and LILACS (1982 to June 2011). Selection criteria Randomised and controlled clinical trials that compared MDC in MND with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or studies that compared MDC in different settings or at different levels of intensity. Studies of ‘other designs’ (such as observational studies) were included only in the Discussion since such studies could only be of limited contribution to the best evidence synthesis. Data collection and analysis We performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality. We grouped studies in terms of setting and intensity (high or low) of therapy. Main results No randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were identified for the original review or this update.  We summarised the results of five observational studies (including one with two reports) in the Discussion section of this review. Authors' conclusions In the absence of randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, the 'best' evidence to date is based on three ‘low’ and two ‘very low quality’ observational studies. These suggest 'very low quality evidence' for an advantage for mental health domains (only) of quality of life without increasing healthcare costs, and 'low level quality' evidence for reduced hospitalisation for MDC in low‐intensity outpatient settings; and 'very low quality' evidence for improved disability in high‐intensity settings. The evidence for survival is conflicting. These conclusions are tentative and the gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that MDC is ineffective. Further research is needed into appropriate study designs; outcome measurement; caregiver needs; and the evaluation of optimal settings, type, intensity or frequency and cost‐effectiveness of MDC in the MND population. Future research should focus on observational designs to assess care and outcomes in 'real‐life' settings. The interface between neurology, rehabilitation and palliative care should be explored to provide long‐term support for MND.","Multidisciplinary care for adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) Motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a fatal neurological disease which produces paralysis of the limb, swallowing and breathing muscles. As there is no current curative treatment for MND, the focus of management is on symptomatic, rehabilitative and palliative therapy, delivered by a 'multidisciplinary' team that is made up of different disciplines (for example, doctors, nurses, therapists) working in a co‐ordinated and organised manner.  This review did not find any high quality randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of such multidisciplinary care, either when originally published in 2009 or for the update in 2011. The evidence from low quality studies suggests that such care may improve some aspects of quality of life, reduce the frequency of hospitalisation and hospital length of stay and improve disability in persons with ALS or MND. The evidence for multidisciplinary care on survival is conflicting. The gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that multidisciplinary care is ineffective. Further research into types of appropriate studies, caregiver needs and various aspects of multidisciplinary care in the MND population is needed.",CD007425
"Background Meloxicam is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly in treating pain associated with arthritis. The usual oral dose for osteoarthritis is 15 mg daily, but lower doses of 7.5 mg are advised in older patients. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. Objectives To assess the efficacy of single dose oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. Search methods We searched Cochrane CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (June 2009); EMBASE (June 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials of oral meloxicam for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the ""pain relief versus time"" curve to derive the proportion of participants with meloxicam experiencing least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals. Main results No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral meloxicam in patients with established postoperative pain. Authors' conclusions In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda.","Single dose oral meloxicam for acute postoperative pain in adults Pain is commonly experienced after surgical procedures. The condition is usually used to test whether or not drugs are effective painkillers in participants with moderate or severe pain. In this case we could find no studies that tested oral meloxicam against placebo. It is possible that the studies were done, but not reported, because they were used only to register meloxicam with licensing authorities throughout the world. However, this leaves an important gap in our knowledge, and it means that we cannot be confident about using oral meloxicam for acute painful conditions.",CD007552
"Background Clinical guidelines recommend vitamin D compounds to suppress serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), however treatment may be associated with increased serum phosphorus and calcium, which are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Observational data also indicate vitamin D therapy may be independently associated with reduced mortality in CKD. Objectives We assessed the effects of vitamin D compounds on clinical, biochemical, and bone outcomes in people with CKD and receiving dialysis. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in subjects with CKD and requiring dialysis that assessed treatment with vitamin D compounds. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted by two authors. Results are summarised as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Sixty studies (2773 patients) were included. No formulation, route, or schedule of administration was associated with altered risks of death, bone pain, or parathyroidectomy. Marked heterogeneity in reporting of outcomes resulted in few data available for formal meta‐analysis. Compared with placebo, vitamin D compounds lowered serum PTH at the expense of increasing serum phosphorus. Trends toward increased hypercalcaemia and serum calcium did not reach statistical significance but may be clinically relevant. Newer vitamin D compounds (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol, doxercalciferol) lowered PTH compared with placebo, with increased risks of hypercalcaemia, although inadequate data were available for serum phosphorus. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH compared with oral treatment, and be associated with lower serum phosphorus and calcium levels, although limitations in the available studies precludes a conclusive statement of treatment efficacy. Few studies were available for intermittent versus daily and intraperitoneal versus oral administration or directly comparative studies of newer versus established vitamin D compounds. Authors' conclusions We confirm that vitamin D compounds suppress PTH in people with CKD and requiring dialysis although treatment is associated with clinical elevations in serum phosphorus and calcium. All studies were inadequately powered to assess the effect of vitamin D on clinical outcomes and until such studies are conducted the relative importance of changes in serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium resulting from vitamin D therapy remain unknown. Observational data showing vitamin D compounds may be associated with improved survival in CKD need to be confirmed or refuted in specifically designed RCTs.","Vitamin D compounds for people with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis People with reduced kidney function (chronic kidney disease; CKD) develop changes in circulating blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. The kidney gradually loses the ability to remove phosphorus from the blood and cannot activate adequate amounts of vitamin D, to maintain normal levels of calcium. The parathyroid gland senses these changes and compensates to increase calcium by elevating production and release of parathyroid hormone. These metabolic changes alter bone metabolism to release calcium and accordingly lead to bone abnormalities including altered bone production. Consequently bone deformation, bone pain, and altered risks of fracture may occur. Treatment for these mineral changes in CKD include replacing activated vitamin D to suppress parathyroid hormone release. Earlier activated vitamin D preparations (calcitriol and alfacalcidol) were associated with increased circulating calcium and phosphorus levels through their direct action on the vitamin D receptor. Newer agents have since been developed that similarly suppress parathyroid hormone but may limit increases in calcium and phosphorus. Avoidance of increased calcium and phosphorus is considered important as these minerals may activate calcification in arteries and tissues, potentially leading to heart disease and tissue damage. We identified 60 studies of vitamin D preparations in people with CKD and requiring dialysis involving 2773 people. No studies were designed to understand the effect of vitamin D therapy on risks of death. Vitamin D agents suppress PTH significantly compared with no treatment, however also increase both circulating calcium and phosphorus levels. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH more than oral vitamin D. Few studies directly compare newer vitamin D therapies with earlier (and presently more common treatment options; calcitriol and alfacalcidol); newer treatment options therefore cannot be recommended as superior to established treatments. In the future, new studies will required to know if vitamin D effects on parathyroid function improve survival, bone pain, and need for parathyroid removal by surgery. It is possible that vitamin D compounds are beneficial to patients regardless of their effects on parathyroid hormone. This can only be adequately evaluated by conducting specific studies that are large enough to be sure of any treatment differences.",CD005633
"Background The dominance of lactobacilli in healthy vaginal microbiota and its depletion in bacterial vaginosis (BV) has given rise to the concept of oral or vaginal instillation of probiotic  Lactobacillus  strains for the management of this condition. Objectives To ascertain the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of BV. Search methods We searched electronic databases irrespective of publication status or language. These included: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the HIV/AIDS and STD Cochrane Review Groups' specialized registers, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2007), ISI science citation index (1955 to 2007), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (1982 to 2007). We handsearched of specialty journals, conference proceedings and publications list on the website of the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (http://www.isapp.net/default.asp). For unpublished studies or ongoing trials, we contacted authors from relevant publications, nutraceutical companies and probiotic‐related scientific associations. We searched electronic databases on ongoing clinical trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials using probiotics for the treatment of women of any age diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis, regardless of diagnostic method used. The probiotic preparation could be single or ""cocktail"" of strains, any preparation type/dosage/route of administration. Studies comparing probiotics with placebo, probiotics used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics compared with placebo or probiotics alone compared with conventional antibiotics were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis We screened titles and abstracts , obtained full reports of relevant trialsand independently appraised them for eligibility. A data extraction form was used to extract data from the four included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived for each study using RevMan (versions 4.2 and 5). We did not perform meta‐analysis due to significant differences in the probiotic preparations and trial methodologies. Main results Analysis suggests beneficial outcome of microbiological cure with the oral metronidazole/probiotic regimen (OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.26)) and the probiotic/estriol preparation (OR 0.02, (95% CI 0.00 to 0.47)). For the probiotic/estriol preparation, the OR and 95% CI for physician‐reported resolution of symptoms was OR 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.56). Authors' conclusions The results do not provide sufficient evidence for or against recommending probiotics for the treatment of BV. The metronidazole/probiotic regimen and probiotic/estriol perparation appear promising but well‐designed randomized controlled trials with standardized methodologies and larger patient size are needed.","Probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most common causes of genital discomfort in women of reproductive age. This condition occurs when there is an imbalance in the population of normal vaginal micro‐organism with depletion of the dominant lactobacilli and overgrowth of other types of bacteria. Treatment of this condition using recommended antibiotics is often associated with failure and high rates of recurrence. This led to the concept of replacing the depleted lactobacilli using probiotic strains as a treatment approach. This review investigated the evidence for the use of probiotic preparations either alone or in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV. The current research does not provide conclusive evidence that probiotics are superior to or enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of BV. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of probiotics either before, during or after antibiotic treatment as a means of ensuring successful treatment or reduce recurrence. Larger, well‐designed randomized controlled trials with standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the benefits of probiotics in the treatment of BV.",CD006289
"Background Carotid patch angioplasty (with either a venous or a synthetic patch) may reduce the risk of carotid artery restenosis and subsequent ischaemic stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 1995 and previously updated in 2004. Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of routine or selective carotid patch angioplasty compared to carotid endarterectomy with primary closure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 5 May 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2008), EMBASE (1980 to November 2008) and Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1980 to November 2008). We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing carotid patch angioplasty with primary closure in any patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included 10 trials involving 1967 patients undergoing 2157 operations. The quality of trials was generally poor. Follow up varied from hospital discharge to five years. Carotid patch angioplasty was associated with a reduction in the risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative period (odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.63, P = 0.001) and long‐term follow up (OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.63, P = 0.001). It was also associated with a reduced risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41, P < 0.0001), and decreased restenosis during long‐term follow up in eight trials (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34, P < 0.00001). These results are more certain than those of the previous review since the number of operations and events have increased. However, the sample sizes are still relatively small, data were not available from all trials, and there was significant loss to follow up. Very few arterial complications, including haemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies and pseudo‐aneurysm formation were recorded with either patch or primary closure. No significant correlation was found between use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long‐term all‐cause death rates. Authors' conclusions Limited evidence suggests that carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion and restenosis. It would appear to reduce the risk of ipsilateral stroke and there is a non significant trend towards a reduction in perioperative any stroke rate and all‐cause case fatality.","Patch angioplasty versus primary closure for carotid endarterectomy Evidence from this review of 10 trials involving 1967 patients undergoing 2157 operations now suggests a benefit from using routine patch angioplasty during carotid endarterectomy. About 20% of strokes result from narrowing of the carotid artery (the main artery supplying blood to the brain). Carotid endarterectomy is an operation that involves opening the carotid artery to remove this narrowing and, therefore, reduce the risk of stroke. However, there is a 2% to 10% risk of the operation itself causing a stroke. Some surgeons advocate the incorporation of a patch made out of either synthetic material or the patient's own vein, into the arterial closure. This may help to reduce the risk of the artery being narrowed during suture placement and may, therefore, reduce the risk of recurrent blockage and consequent stroke or death or both. However, use of a patch may increase surgical difficulty and operation length. Furthermore, thin‐walled vein patches may rupture with potentially fatal consequences and synthetic materials are vulnerable to infection.",CD000160
"Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is known to be associated with an increased risk of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The majority of lymphomas (>80%) occurring during immunosuppression are aggressive B‐cell in origin and have a high‐to‐intermediate histology grade. Treatment of NHL is not standardized. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of single agent or combination chemotherapy with or without immunochemotherapy (rituximab) and with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS) for previously untreated patients with AIDS‐related NHL. Search methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966‐March 6, 2009), EMBASE (1988‐March 6, 2009), LlLACS (1982 to February 17, 2009), Gateway (March 6, 2009), and AIDSearch (2006 ‐February 2008) were used to identify published, potentially eligible trials. Further, we searched several electronic sources. For additional information see the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group search strategy. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of systemic treatments for previously untreated AIDS‐related NHL. There were no age or language restrictions. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion; four RCTs were selected. No meta‐analysis was attempted due to clinical heterogeneity. Main results Four RCTs that included 857 patients (number range: 30 to 485) met the inclusion criteria. The studies have a high risk of bias; three RCTs were conducted in the United States and one was a multi‐national, multi‐centre RCT performed in France and Italy. One of the trials included only men. It was impossible to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the differences in the interventions assessed in these RCTs. Overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Disease free survival (DFS) was reported in two of the four RCTs, but it was not statistically significant between treatment groups. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that the systemic interventions for untreated patients with AIDS‐related NHL provide superior clinical effectiveness for improving OS, DSF, and tumour response rate; however, this conclusion is based on four RCTs with limited sample size and variable quality. More adequately powered RCTs that have low risk of bias are necessary to determine the real benefit or harm of interventions to treat this population. Overall survival (OS), DFS, and quality of life should be included as endpoints.","Interventions for untreated patients with AIDS‐associated non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. There are two general types: Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common AIDS‐defining malignancy in HIV‐infected patients. The most frequent clinical presentations of NHL during AIDS are systemic illness with the compromise of the primary central nervous system and with primary effusion. In people with HIV infection, most lymphomas have originated in an aggressive B‐cell precursor and have a high‐to‐intermediate histology grade. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of different interventions for treating AIDS‐associated NHL found unclear evidence for efficacy and safety.",CD005419
"Background Hydrotubation with oil‐soluble contrast media for unexplained infertility and adhesiolysis for infertility due to peritubal adhesions are primary procedures that are of recognised benefit. It is less clear whether postoperative procedures such as hydrotubation or second‐look laparoscopy with adhesiolysis are beneficial following pelvic reproductive surgery. Objectives To assess the value of postoperative hydrotubation and second‐look laparoscopy with adhesiolysis following female pelvic reproductive surgery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (August 2008), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (1980 to August 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2008), Current Contents (1993 to August 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to August 2008), CINAHL (1982 to August 2008) and reference lists of identified articles. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials in which a postoperative procedure was compared with a control group following pelvic reproductive surgery were considered for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Five randomised controlled trials were identified and included in this updated review. An attempt was made to obtain further information from the authors of all five trials. All trials were assessed for quality. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth, ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage rates, and the rates of tubal patency and procedure‐related complications. Review authors extracted the data independently and the odds ratios (OR) were estimated for these dichotomous outcomes. Main results Five randomised controlled trials were identified and included in this review. The odds of pregnancy (OR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.21) and live birth (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.59) were not significantly different with postoperative hydrotubation versus no hydrotubation. The odds of pregnancy (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07) or live birth (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.32) were also not significantly different with second‐look laparoscopy and adhesiolysis versus no second‐look laparoscopy. Whether hydrotubation was early or late and whether hydrotubation fluid contained steroid or not had no significant impact on the odds of pregnancy or live birth. Late antibiotic hydrotubation increased the odds of at least one patent fallopian tube when compared with early hydrotubation in women (OR 7.72, 95% CI 2.50 to 8.93). The odds of infective morbidity significantly increased with early hydrotubation when compared with late non‐antibiotic hydrotubation (OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.50 to 8.93). When comparing late hydrotubation following tubal stent removal with early hydrotubation in women who had no tubal stenting, there was no significant difference in pregnancy or live birth rates. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the routine practice of hydrotubation or second‐look laparoscopy following female pelvic reproductive surgery. The studies on which this conclusion is based were either of poor quality or underpowered. These interventions should be performed in the context of a good quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trial. Postoperative hydrotubation with fluid containing antibiotic may offer benefit over hydrotubation fluid without antibiotic following tubal surgery. A randomised controlled trial of postoperative hydrotubation with antibiotic‐containing fluid versus no hydrotubation for improving fertility following tubal surgery is justified.",Postoperative procedures for improving fertility following pelvic reproductive surgery There is insufficient evidence to show the benefit or harm of routine hydrotubation or second‐look laparoscopy following surgery on a woman's reproductive system. Surgery to correct tubal damage is undertaken to improve pregnancy and live birth rates. Laparoscopy (where the abdominal organs are examined through a small surgical cut in the abdomen) to treat postoperative adhesions and postoperative hydrotubation (flushing out of the fallopian tubes) have been used to improve the results of tubal surgery. The review of trials found there is insufficient evidence to support the routine practice of hydrotubation or this second‐look laparoscopy after pelvic reproductive surgery. More research is needed.,CD001897
"Background Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness and is a leading cause for paediatric admission to hospital. Asthma management for children results in substantial costs. There is evidence to suggest that hospital admissions could be reduced with effective education for parents and children about asthma and its management. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of the literature and update the previous review as to whether asthma education leads to improved health outcomes in children who have attended the emergency room for asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, including the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases, and reference lists of trials and review articles (last search May 2008). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of asthma education for children who had attended the emergency department for asthma, with or without hospitalisation, within the previous 12 months. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled dichotomous data with a fixed‐effect risk ratio. We used a random‐effects risk ratio for sensitivity analysis of heterogenous data. Main results A total of 38 studies involving 7843 children were included. Following educational intervention delivered to children, their parents or both, there was a significantly reduced risk of subsequent emergency department visits (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81, N = 3008) and hospital admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92, N = 4019) compared with control. There were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.81, N = 1009). Very few data were available for other outcomes (FEV1, PEF, rescue medication use, quality of life or symptoms) and there was no statistically significant difference between education and control. Authors' conclusions Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department presentation and hospital admission. There remains uncertainty as to the long‐term effect of education on other markers of asthma morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function. It remains unclear as to what type, duration and intensity of educational packages are the most effective in reducing acute care utilisation.","What are the effects of educational interventions delivered to children and/or their families, who have experienced an emergency department visit with their asthma within the previous 12 months? Asthma care for children in our society is common and costly. There is now evidence that educational intervention for children who have attended the emergency department for asthma lowers the risk of the need for future emergency department visits and hospital admissions. This review looked at studies which compared usual care for asthma to more intensive educational programmes and the results showed a statistically significant reduction in the treatment groups needing subsequent emergency department visits or hospital admissions. We were not able to determine the most effective type, duration or intensity of education that should be offered to children to offer the best asthma outcomes.",CD001290
"Background Information and communication technologies (ICT) are defined as digital and analogue technologies that facilitate the capturing, processing, storage and exchange of information via electronic communication. ICTs have the potential to improve information management, access to health services, quality of care, continuity of services, and cost containment. Knowledge is lacking on conditions for successful ICT integration into practice. Objectives To carry out a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the adoption of ICT by healthcare professionals. Search methods Specific strategies, defined with the help of an information specialist, were used to search the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) register and additional relevant databases. We considered studies published from January 1990 until October 2007. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before/after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) that reported objectively measured outcomes concerning the effect of interventions to promote adoption of ICT in healthcare professionals' practices. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed each potentially relevant study for inclusion. We resolved discrepancies by discussion or a third reviewer. Two teams of two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. A meta‐analysis of study outcomes was not possible, given the small number of included studies and the heterogeneity of intervention and outcomes measures. We conducted qualitative analyses, and have presented the results in a narrative format. Main results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine of them were RCTs. All studies involved physicians as participants (including postgraduate trainees), and one study also included other participants. Only two studies measured patient outcomes. Searching skills and/or frequency of use of electronic databases, mainly MEDLINE, were targeted in eight studies. Use of Internet for audit and feedback, and email for provider‐patient communication, were targeted in two studies. Four studies showed small to moderate positive effects of the intervention on ICT adoption. Four studies were unable to demonstrate significant positive effects, and the two others showed mixed effects. No studies looked at the long‐term effect or sustainability of the intervention. Authors' conclusions There is very limited evidence on effective interventions promoting the adoption of ICTs by healthcare professionals. Small effects have been reported for interventions targeting the use of electronic databases and digital libraries. The effectiveness of interventions to promote ICT adoption in healthcare settings remains uncertain, and more well designed trials are needed.","Promoting the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by health care professionals Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are technologies that help gather, store, process and share information electronically.  Examples of ICTs are electronic medical records, medical journals and databases on the internet, videoconferencing for doctor appointments, or systems on the internet to give feedback to doctors so they can improve the care they provide.  ICTs have the potential to improve health care and the health of patients.  But even though computers are being used more and more in hospitals, not all health care professionals use ICTs.   For this reason, there are many strategies to try and promote the use of ICTs.  Strategies can include training groups of health care professionals to use a specific ICT, or teaching someone one‐on‐one to use an ICT, or simply providing training materials.    A review of the effects of different strategies to promote the use of ICTs was conducted.  After searching for all relevant studies, 10 studies were found.  The evidence shows that some ways, such as group training, or one‐on‐one training sessions, or providing training materials, may improve the use of ICTs.  But overall, it is still uncertain whether some strategies are effective.  More research is needed.",CD006093
"Background While the use of supplemental oxygen has a long history in neonatal care, resulting in both significant health care benefits and harms, uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target blood oxygen levels in preterm and low birth weight infants. Potential benefits of higher oxygen targeting may include more stable sleep patterns and improved long‐term growth and development. However, there may be significant deleterious pulmonary effects and health service use implications resulting from such a policy. Objectives To determine whether targeting ambient oxygen concentration to achieve a lower vs. higher blood oxygen range, or administering restricted vs. liberal supplemental oxygen, effects mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, lung function, growth or development in preterm or low birth weight infants. Search methods The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. An additional literature search was conducted of the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases in order to locate any trials in addition to those provided by the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR). Search updated to week two July 2008. Selection criteria All trials in preterm or low birth weight infants utilising random or quasi‐random patient allocation in which ambient oxygen concentrations were targeted to achieve a lower vs. higher blood oxygen range, or restricted vs. liberal oxygen was administered were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis The methodological quality of the eligible trials was assessed independently by each review author for the degree of selection, performance, attrition and detection bias. Data were extracted and reviewed independently by the each author. Data analysis was conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results In the meta‐analysis of the five trials included in this review, the restriction of oxygen significantly reduced the incidence and severity of retinopathy of prematurity without unduly increasing death rates The one prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, randomized trial investigating lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels from 32 weeks postmenstrual age showed no significant differences in the rates of ROP, mortality or growth and development between the two groups. However, this study did show increased rates of chronic lung disease and home oxygen use. Authors' conclusions The results of this systematic review confirm that (the now historical) policy of unrestricted, unmonitored oxygen therapy has potential harms without clear benefits. However, the question of what is the optimal target range for maintaining blood oxygen levels in preterm/LBW infants was not answered by the data available for inclusion in this review.",Restricted versus liberal oxygen exposure for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm or low birth weight infants Restricting oxygen supplementation significantly reduces the rate and severity of vision problems (retinopathy) in premature and low birth weight babies. Babies born either prematurely (before 37 weeks) or with a low birth weight often have breathing problems and need extra oxygen. Oxygen supplementation has provided many benefits for these babies but can cause damage to the eyes (retinopathy) and lungs. The review of trials found that unrestricted oxygen supplementation has these potential adverse effects without any clear benefits. Restricted oxygen significantly reduces these risks. More research is needed to find the best level of oxygen supplementation.,CD001077
"Background In the past decade, a novel class of therapies directed against specific cytokines implicated in the disease process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), called the 'Biologics' have greatly improved and expanded treatment for RA. Anakinra is an interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist that is currently FDA‐approved for moderate‐severe RA that has been unresponsive to initial disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of anakinra in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to Week 4 2008) , EMBASE (1980 to Week 5 2008), CINAHL (1982 to November 2007) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing anakinra alone or in combination with DMARDs or biologics to placebo or other DMARDs or biologics in patients >18 years old with rheumatoid arthritis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Five trials involving 2876 patients, 781 randomized to placebo and 2065 to anakinra, were included. There was a significant improvement in number of participants achieving ACR20 (38% versus 23%) who were treated with anakinra 50 to 150 mg daily versus placebo after 24 weeks. This 15% increase in patients achieving ACR20 with anakinra versus placebo is felt to be a clinically meaningful, though modest, outcome. Other efficacy data ‐ including ACR50 (18% versus 7%), ACR70 (7% versus 2%), HAQ, visual analog score (VAS), Larsen radiographic scores, and change in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ‐ all demonstrated significant improvement with anakinra 50 to 150 mg daily versus placebo as well. There were no statistically significant differences noted in most safety outcomes with treatment with anakinra versus placebo ‐ including number of withdrawals, deaths, adverse events (total and serious), and infections (total and serious). Injection site reactions were significantly increased, occurring in 1235/1729 (71%) versus 204/729 (28%) of patients treated with anakinra versus placebo, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was clinically higher, but not statistically different, in the anakinra (25/1366 patients, 1.8%) versus placebo group (3/534 patients, 0.6%). Authors' conclusions Anakinra is a relatively safe and modestly efficacious biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Although head to head comparison trials have not been carried out, the amount of improvement is notably less when compared to studies using other biologic therapies. More studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy, especially in comparison to other therapies, and adverse event data for the long‐term use of Anakinra has yet to be assessed.","Anakinra for Rheumatoid Arthritis This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of Anakrina on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The review shows that in people with RA, Taking Anakrina for 6 months may improve RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness. What are RA and Anakrina? When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move.   Anakinra is an interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist which is a drug that blocks the inflammatory protein interleukin‐1. The drug is used to slow the progression of moderate to severe active RA in patients over age 18 who have not responded to one or more of  the disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARD).  Anakrina can be used with other RA drugs. Best estimate of what happens to people with RA who take Anakrina: 23 out of 100 people experienced improvement of RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness when taking a placebo 38 out of 100 people experienced improvement of RA symptoms such as pain, function, and stiffness when taking Anakrina 15 more people out of 100 experienced improvement of RA symptoms after taking Anakrina for 6 months compared with taking a placebo.",CD005121
"Background Sporting organisations provide an important setting for health promotion strategies that involve policies, communication of healthy messages and creation of health promoting environments. The introduction of policy interventions within sporting organisations is one strategy to target high risk behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, excess sun exposure, unhealthy eating and discrimination. Objectives To update a review of all controlled studies evaluating policy interventions organised through sporting settings to increase healthy behaviour (related to smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, discrimination, safety and access). Search methods We updated the original (2004) searches in May 2007. We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library,  Issue 2 2007); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations (2004 to Week 3 April 2007); EMBASE (2004 to Week 17 2007); PsyclNFO (2004 to April Week 1 2007); CINAHL (2004 to Week 1 May 2007); SPORTDiscus (2004 to April 2007); Sociological Abstracts (2004 to 2007); Dissertation Abstracts (2004 to May 2007), ERIC (2000 to 2007), freely available online health promotion and sports‐related databases hosted by leading agencies, and the internet using sport and policy‐related key words. Selection criteria Controlled studies evaluating any policy intervention implemented through sporting organisations to instigate and/or sustain healthy behaviour change, intention to change behaviour, or changes in attitudes, knowledge or awareness of healthy behaviour, in people of all ages. Policies must address any of the following: smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, access for disadvantaged groups, physical safety (not including injuries), and social and emotional health (e.g. anti‐vilification, anti‐discrimination). Uncontrolled studies which met the other inclusion criteria were to be reported in an annex to the review. Data collection and analysis We assessed whether identified citations met the inclusion criteria. Abstracts were inspected independently by two review authors and full papers were obtained where necessary. As we located no controlled evaluation studies, we did not undertake data collection or analysis. We found no uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria, and therefore present no annex to the review. Main results We found no rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of policy interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase healthy behaviours, attitudes, knowledge or the inclusion of health‐oriented policies within the organisations. Authors' conclusions We found no controlled studies to guide the use of policy interventions used in sporting settings. The original (2004) searches identified a number of case studies with anecdotal reporting of outcomes. We strongly recommend that rigorous evaluation techniques are employed more commonly in this field to illuminate the impact of health promoting policy on outcomes, and the contexts and processes which are likely to be effective in reducing harmful behaviours.","Policy interventions implemented through sporting organisations to promote healthy behaviour change Sporting organisations provide an important setting for health promoting policies to create health promoting environments and to support health‐oriented behaviour change. The introduction of policy interventions within sporting organisations is one strategy to target high risk behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, excess sun exposure, unhealthy eating and discrimination, as those who access sport settings have been shown to have elevated risk behaviours. We found no controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of policy interventions implemented in sporting settings to promote healthy behaviour. The study designs employed in evaluations of these policies typically have been case studies, thereby limiting our understanding of the effectiveness of such health promoting strategies.",CD004809
"Background Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured over a laparotomy approach as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs. Currently the commonest procedures for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata are either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique for treating an ovarian endometrioma, either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall, measuring the outcomes improvement in pain symptoms and fertility. The primary endpoints assessed were the relief of pain and, in women desiring to conceive, the subsequent pregnancy rate (either spontaneous or as part of fertility treatment). Secondary outcomes assessed were the recurrence of the endometrioma and the recurrence of symptoms. Search methods The review authors searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of trials (to 31st August 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009) and reference lists of articles; and handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings and contacted leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery throughout the world.The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and CENTRAL. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of excision of the cyst capsule versus drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst in the management of ovarian endometriomata. Data collection and analysis Review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality. Main results Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata, size greater than 3 cm, for the primary symptom of pain were included. For the primary outcome measures laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51) and non‐menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56). In those women subsequently attempting to conceive excision of the cyst wall was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior subfertility (OR 5.21, 95% CI 2.04 to13.29) compared to women who underwent laparoscopic ablation of the endometrioma. For the secondary outcome measures laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.93) and with a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79) compared with surgery to ablate the endometrioma. A further randomised study was identified that demonstrated an increased ovarian follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for women who had undergone excisional surgery when compared to ablative surgery (mean difference (MD) 0.6, 95% CI 0.04 to1.16). There is insufficient evidence to support excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chances of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra‐uterine insemination (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.15). Authors' conclusions There is good evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of pain symptoms, and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However in women who may subsequently undergo fertility treatment, insufficient evidence exists to determine the favoured surgical approach.","Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometriomata Endometriomata are benign growths of the ovary. Evidence suggests that surgery to remove the endometrioma provides better results than draining and destroying the lining of the cyst with regard to the recurrence of the cyst, pain symptoms and also the chance of a spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Surgery to excise the cyst should be the favoured surgical approach. Evidence that one technique is favoured in women who desire to conceive and who seek in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is however lacking. An additional randomised trial demonstrated that in women trying to conceive the ovarian response to stimulation, as part of fertility treatment, is better in women who have undergone surgery to remove the cyst rather than draining and destroying the endometrioma. The subsequent likelihood of pregnancy was not affected. Further research is required in this field to assess quality of life after surgery, clarify the effect of surgery on fertility with IVF treatment and to study the effect of surgery on ovarian function.",CD004992
"Background There is a high prevalence of impairments among people 65+, and the elderly population is increasing in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance, individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for older adults with impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions. Search methods Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. Selection criteria This review included older adults (65+) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included. Data collection and analysis Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. Outcomes data were extracted. Because they made different comparisons, studies were not combined for meta‐analyses. Studies were assessed for the possibility of bias. Results and potential sources of bias are presented for included studies. Main results Four studies involving 1642 participants made three eligible comparisons: (i) personal assistance versus usual care, (ii) personal assistance versus nursing homes, and (iii) personal assistance versus 'cluster care'. One was an RCT, three were non‐randomised. Personal assistance was generally preferred over other services; however, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance probably has some benefits for some recipients and caregivers. Paid assistance probably substitutes for informal care and may cost government more than alternatives; however, the total costs to recipients and society are currently unknown. Authors' conclusions Research in this field is limited. Personal assistance is expensive and difficult to organise, especially in places that do not already have services in place. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient.","Personal assistance for older adults without dementia Personal assistance is paid support of at least 20 hours per week for people with impairments.

"Background Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful and discomforting intervention widely used in neonatal intensive care units. Newborn babies (neonates) demonstrate increased sensitivity to pain, which may affect clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The use of drugs that reduce pain might be important in improving survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Objectives To determine the effect of opioid analgesics (pain‐killing drugs derived from opium e.g. morphine), compared to placebo, no drug, or other non‐opioid analgesics or sedatives, on pain, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Search methods Electronic searches included: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007); EMBASE (1974 to June 2007); and CINAHL (1982 to 2007). Previous reviews and lists of relevant articles were cross‐referenced. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing opioids to a control, or to other analgesics or sedatives in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two review authors. Categorical outcomes were analysed using relative risk and risk difference; and continuous outcomes with weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference. A fixed effect model was used for meta‐analysis except where heterogeneity existed, in which case a random effects model was used. Main results Thirteen studies on 1505 infants were included. Infants given opioids showed reduced premature infant pain profile (PIPP) scores compared to the control group (weighted mean difference ‐1.71; 95% confidence interval ‐3.18 to ‐0.24). Differences in execution and reporting of trials mean that this meta‐analysis should be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity was significantly high in all analyses of pain, even when lower quality studies were excluded and analysis limited to very preterm newborns. Meta‐analyses of mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and long and short‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes showed no statistically significant differences. Very preterm infants given morphine took significantly longer to reach full enteral feeding than those in control groups (weighted mean difference 2.10 days; 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 3.85). One study compared morphine with a sedative: the treatments showed similar pain scores, but morphine had fewer adverse effects. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of opioids in mechanically ventilated newborns. Opioids should be used selectively, when indicated by clinical judgment and evaluation of pain indicators. If sedation is required, morphine is safer than midazolam. Further research is needed. This review has been superseded by a new Cochrane review (Bellù 2021).","Opioids for neonates receiving mechanical ventilation There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of opioids (e.g. morphine) to reduce pain in newborn babies (full‐term or preterm) with breathing difficulties on breathing machines. Breathing machines, which are widely used for newborn full‐term and preterm babies with breathing problems, may cause babies pain. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain ‐ which may have a bad effect on future development ‐ pain‐reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine) might be very important. This review found no evidence for routine use of opioids for newborns on breathing machines. Although relief of pain was variable, opioids were no better or worse for babies (in terms of death, strokes, future development, duration of ventilation or hospital stay) than other drugs or placebo. Further research is needed. This review has been superseded by a new Cochrane review (Bellù 2021).",CD004212
"Background Lifestyle interventions are often recommended as initial treatment for mild hypertension, but the efficacy of relaxation therapies is unclear.

Selection criteria Inclusion criteria: RCTs of a parallel design comparing relaxation therapies with no active treatment, or sham therapy; follow‐up ≥8 weeks; participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg); SBP and DBP reported at end of follow‐up. Exclusion criteria: participants were pregnant; participants received antihypertensive medication which changed during the trial. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta‐analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Main results 29 RCTs, with eight weeks to five years follow‐up, met our inclusion criteria; four were excluded from the primary meta‐analysis because of inadequate outcome data. The remaining 25 trials assessed 1,198 participants, but adequate randomisation was confirmed in only seven trials and concealment of allocation in only one. Only one trial reported deaths, heart attacks and strokes (one of each). Meta‐analysis indicated that relaxation resulted in small, statistically significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: ‐5.5 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐8.2 to ‐2.8, I2 =72%) and DBP (mean difference: ‐3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐5.3 to ‐1.6, I2 =75%) compared to control. The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by duration of follow‐up, type of control, type of relaxation therapy or baseline blood pressure. The nine trials that reported blinding of outcome assessors found a non‐significant net reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: ‐3.2 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐7.7 to 1.4, I 2  =69%) associated with relaxation. The 15 trials comparing relaxation with sham therapy likewise found a non‐significant reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: ‐3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐7.1 to 0.2, I 2  =63%). Authors' conclusions In view of the poor quality of included trials and unexplained variation between trials, the evidence in favour of causal association between relaxation and blood pressure reduction is weak. Some of the apparent benefit of relaxation was probably due to aspects of treatment unrelated to relaxation.","Relaxation for high blood pressure in adults which has no clearly identified cause The World Health Organisation estimates that high blood pressure leads to over 7 million deaths each year, about 13% of the total deaths worldwide. If people lower their blood pressure, they are less likely to die or to have heart attacks and strokes. If someone's blood pressure is only slightly too high, they may prefer trying to lower it by changing their lifestyle rather than starting on drugs. Although we know that relaxing can counteract the short‐term increases in blood pressure that are caused by stress, we don't know if a sustained programme of relaxation can produce long‐term reductions in blood pressure or decrease the risk of death, heart attack and stroke. Our review pooled findings from 1,198 people with blood pressure over 140/85 mmHg who were enrolled in 25 randomised controlled trials. These trials compared the effect of relaxation either with no treatment or with a dummy treatment which wasn't expected to reduce blood pressure. Overall, relaxation reduced blood pressure by a small amount: the average reduction was 5/3 mmHg, but might be anywhere between 8/5 mmHg and 3/2 mmHg. Different trials gave different − sometimes inconsistent − results. Many of the trials were not well designed or conducted. In the good quality trials, relaxation resulted in smaller average reductions in blood pressure and the results could even be consistent with an average increase in blood pressure. Even when all the trials were put together, the combined group of all the people in all the trials wasn't large enough and the trials didn't run for long enough to tell us whether relaxation could reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke. Few people reported side‐effects of relaxation and, on average, people were just as likely to report side‐effects of the comparison treatment. Different types of relaxation were taught in different trials. It was difficult to disentangle their effects, especially as many trials used a combination of methods. Overall, we found no evidence that autogenic training was effective. Progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive/behavioural therapies and biofeedback seemed to be more likely to reduce blood pressure. However, some of the reduction in blood pressure was almost certainly due to aspects of treatment that were not related to relaxation, such as frequent contact with professionals who were trying to help.",CD004935
"Background Trials have assessed bile acids for patients with viral hepatitis, but no consensus has been reached regarding their usefulness. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for viral hepatitis. Search methods Searches were performed in  The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register  (July 2007),  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 1, 2007),  MEDLINE  (July 2007),  EMBASE  (July 2007), Science Citation Index Expanded (July 2007), and  Chinese Biomedical Database  (July 2007). Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of bile acids versus placebo or no intervention for viral hepatitis were included, irrespective of language, publication status, or blinding. Co‐interventions were allowed in the included randomised clinical trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted the data independently. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated with respect to generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow‐up. The outcomes were presented as relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We identified 29 randomised trials of bile acids for hepatitis B or C; none were of high methodological quality. We were unable to extract data from two trials. In one trial, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) versus placebo for acute hepatitis B significantly reduced the risk of hepatitis B surface antigen positivity at the end of treatment and serum HBV DNA level at the end of follow‐up. In another trial, UDCA versus no intervention for chronic hepatitis B significantly reduced the risk of having abnormal serum transaminase activities at the end of treatment. Twenty‐five trials compared bile acids (21 trials UDCA; four trials tauro‐UDCA) versus placebo or no intervention with or without co‐interventions for chronic hepatitis C. Bile acids did not significantly reduce the risk of having detectable serum HCV RNA (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), cirrhosis, or portal and periportal inflammation score at the end of treatment. Bile acids significantly decreased the risk of having abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase activity at the end of treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90) and follow‐up (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98). Bile acids significantly increased the Knodell score (WMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31) at the end of treatment. No severe adverse events were reported. We did not identify trials including patients with hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. Authors' conclusions Bile acids lead to a significant improvement in serum transaminase activities in hepatitis B and C but have no effects on the clearance of virus. There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute effects on long‐term outcomes including hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and liver related mortality. Randomised trials with high methodological quality are required before clinical use is considered.","Bile acids may improve liver biochemistry of patients with hepatitis B or C, but there is insufficient evidence about long‐term beneficial effects Viral hepatitis causes significant morbidity and mortality. Based on this Cochrane systematic review, bile acids may decrease serum transaminase activities in patients with acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, or chronic hepatitis C. However, bile acids have no effects in eradicating viral markers. There is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute effects on the long‐term outcomes that include hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and/or liver related mortality. No clinical trials have evaluated bile acids for patients with hepatitis A, acute hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. Accordingly, bile acids should first be evaluated in adequately sized and adequately conducted randomised trials before clinical use is considered.",CD003181
"Background While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an 'accepted' cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efficacy and method of delivery is not currently available. Objectives To assess the effects of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice for adults with type 2 diabetes. Search methods We carried out a comprehensive search of  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, bibliographies and contacted relevant experts. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention. Data collection and analysis The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data. Main results Thirty‐six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this review were low‐fat/high‐carbohydrate diets, high‐fat/low‐carbohydrate diets, low‐calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very‐low‐calorie (500 kcal per day) diets and modified fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced fat diet and five studies assessed low‐fat diets versus moderate fat or low‐carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very‐low‐calorie diet versus a low‐calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for well‐designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow‐up, although there is a promising study currently underway.","Dietary advice for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults No high quality data on the efficacy of diet alone exists for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This systematic review assesses the effects of studies that examined dietary advice with or without the addition of exercise or behavioural approaches. Eighteen studies were included. No data were found on micro‐ or macrovascular diabetic complications, mortality or quality of life. It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from the limited data that are presented in this review, however, the addition of exercise to dietary advice showed improvement of metabolic control after six‐ and twelve‐month follow‐up.",CD004097
"Background Poor voice quality due to functional dysphonia can lead to a reduced quality of life. In occupations where voice use is substantial it can lead to a loss of employment. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to treat functional dysphonia in adults. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (PubMed, 1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 2 2006), CINAHL (1983 to 2006), PsychINFO (1967 to 2006), Science Citation Index (1986 to 2006) and the Occupational Health databases OSH‐ROM (to 2006). The date of the last search was 5 th  April 2006. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions evaluating the effectiveness of treatments targeted at adults with functional dysphonia. For work‐directed interventions interrupted time series and prospective cohort studies were also eligible. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Meta‐analysis was performed where appropriate. Main results We identified six randomised controlled trials including a total of 163 participants in intervention groups and 141 controls. One trial was high quality. Interventions were grouped into 1) Direct voice therapy 2) Indirect voice therapy 3) Combination of direct and indirect voice therapy and 4) Other treatments: pharmacological treatment and vocal hygiene instructions given by phoniatrist. No studies were found evaluating direct voice therapy on its own. One study did not show indirect voice therapy on its own to be effective when compared to no intervention. There is evidence from three studies for the effectiveness of a combination of direct and indirect voice therapy on self‐reported vocal functioning (SMD ‐1.07; 95% CI ‐1.94 to ‐0.19), on observer‐rated vocal functioning (WMD ‐13.00; 95% CI ‐17.92 to ‐8.08) and on instrumental assessment of vocal functioning (WMD ‐1.20; 95% CI ‐2.37 to ‐0.03) when compared to no intervention. The results of one study also show that the remedial effect remains significant for at least 14 weeks on self‐reported vocal functioning (SMD ‐0.51; 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.14) and on observer‐rated vocal functioning (Buffalo Voice Profile) (WMD ‐0.80; 95% CI ‐1.14 to ‐0.46). There is also limited evidence from one study that the number of symptoms may remain lower for a year. The combined therapy with biofeedback was not shown to be more effective than combined therapy alone in one study nor was pharmacological treatment found to be more effective than vocal hygiene instructions given by phoniatrist in one study. Publication bias may have influenced the results. Authors' conclusions Evidence is available for the effectiveness of comprehensive voice therapy comprising both direct and indirect therapy elements. Effects are similar in patients and in teachers and student teachers screened for voice problems. Larger and methodologically better studies are needed with outcome measures that match treatment aims.","Interventions for treating functional dysphonia in adults Functional dysphonia is characterised by an abnormal quality of voice in the absence of an identifiable lesion. People in occupations where voice use is central, like teachers, are more at risk of developing functional dysphonia. The causes of voice disorders are still being debated. There is also no consensus on the best method of evaluating voice, although many consider auditory voice quality assessment as a gold standard measure. Because functional dysphonia is a non‐organic voice disorder there is no indication for surgical or medical interventions, and it is treated with behavioural (i.e. voice) therapy. Voice therapy usually consists of a combination of direct and indirect treatment techniques. Direct techniques focus on the underlying physiological changes needed to improve an individual's technique in using the vocal system whereas indirect techniques concentrate on contributory and maintenance aspects of the voice disorder (such as lack of knowledge). We conducted a systematic search of the literature on treating functional dysphonia in adults. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and combined their results. A combination of direct and indirect voice therapy is effective in improving vocal functioning when compared to no intervention. The achieved results may still be apparent after a year. Most of the studies are small and of low methodological quality and further research is warranted.",CD006373
"Background Diabetes has long been recognised as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Prospective studies show that compared to their non‐diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four. The two biggest trials in type 2 diabetes, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study did not reveal a reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control. Theoretical benefits of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR‐gamma) activator rosiglitazone on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors might result in fewer macrovascular disease events in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objectives To assess the effects of rosiglitazone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Search methods Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and  The Cochrane Library . Selection criteria Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adult people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and had a trial duration of at least 24 weeks. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pooling of studies by means of fixed‐effects meta‐analysis could be performed for adverse events only. Main results Eighteen trials which randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone treatment were identified. Longest duration of therapy was four years with a median of 26 weeks. Published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide evidence that patient‐oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health‐related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically relevant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Occurrence of oedema was significantly raised (OR 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.81). The single large RCT (ADOPT ‐ A Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial) indicated increased cardiovascular risk. New data on raised fracture rates in women reveal extensive action of rosiglitazone in various body tissues. Authors' conclusions New studies should focus on patient‐oriented outcomes to clarify the benefit‐risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy. Safety data and adverse events of all investigations (published and unpublished) should be made available to the public.","Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus Diseases of the heart and blood vessels account for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes. Compared to their non‐diabetic counterparts the relative risk of mortality caused by disorders of the heart and blood vessels is two to three for men and three to four for women with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is mainly characterised by a reduced ability of the hormone insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in body fat and muscles (insulin resistance) and affects most people suffering from diabetes. Several medications are on the market to treat diabetes, amongst them rosiglitazone as a member of the 'glitazones' reduced risk markers for diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Since the two biggest trials in people with type 2 diabetes showed that improved blood glucose alone is not enough to reduce the risk of the above mentioned diseases we looked for longer‐term studies investigating 24 weeks as a minimum of rosiglitazone treatment on patient‐oriented outcomes. As patient‐oriented outcomes we defined mortality, complications of diabetes, side effects of the medication, health‐related quality of life, costs and metabolic control (lowering of blood glucose to near normal levels). Eighteen trials randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone therapy. The longest duration of rosiglitazone treatment was four years, most trials lasted around half a year. Unfortunately, the published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide relevant evidence that patient‐oriented outcomes are positively influenced by this agent. The chance of developing oedema was approximately doubled, the risk of cardiovascular diseases increased. The single large randomised controlled trial showed evidence of raised cardiovascular risk after rosiglitazone treatment. Moreover, new safety data show increased numbers of broken bones in women. This finding was published years after approval of this agent by drug regulatory authorities. New ways of exploring drug effects, for example by early long‐term studies in many people, as well as public access to all safety data of published and unpublished investigations have to be established.",CD006063
"Background Structured antenatal education programs for childbirth or parenthood, or both, are commonly recommended for pregnant women and their partners by healthcare professionals in many parts of the world. Such programs are usually offered to groups but may be offered to individuals. Objectives To assess the effects of this education on knowledge acquisition, anxiety, sense of control, pain, labour and birth support, breastfeeding, infant‐care abilities, and psychological and social adjustment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2006), CINAHL (1982 to April 2006), ERIC (1984 to April 2006), EMBASE (1980 to April 2006) and PsycINFO (1988 to April 2006). We handsearched the Journal of Psychosomatic Research from 1956 to April 2006 and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 7 July 2011 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of any structured educational program provided during pregnancy by an educator to either parent that included information related to pregnancy, birth or parenthood. The educational interventions could have been provided on an individual or group basis. Educational interventions directed exclusively to either increasing breastfeeding success, knowledge of and coping skills concerning postpartum depression, improving maternal psycho‐social health including anxiety, depression and self‐esteem or reducing smoking were excluded. Data collection and analysis Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results Nine trials, involving 2284 women, were included. Thirty‐seven studies were excluded. Educational interventions were the focus of eight of the studies (combined n = 1009). Details of the randomization procedure, allocation concealment, and/or participant accrual or loss for these trials were not reported. No consistent results were found. Sample sizes were very small to moderate, ranging from 10 to 318. No data were reported concerning anxiety, breastfeeding success, or general social support. Knowledge acquisition, sense of control, factors related to infant‐care competencies, and some labour and birth outcomes were measured. The largest of the included studies (n = 1275) examined an educational and social support intervention to increase vaginal birth after caesarean section. This high‐quality study showed similar rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section in 'verbal' and 'document' groups (relative risk 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.21). Authors' conclusions The effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown. Individualized prenatal education directed toward avoidance of a repeat caesarean birth does not increase the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section. [Note: the 58 citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]","Individual or group antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both Benefits of antenatal education for childbirth, and the best educational approaches to use, remain unclear. Antenatal education aims to help prospective parents prepare for childbirth and parenthood. Prospective parents often look to antenatal education to provide important information on issues such as decision making about and during labour, skills for labour, pain relief, infant and postnatal care, breastfeeding and parenting skills. There are many varied ways of providing this antenatal education and some may be more effective than others. The review found nine trials involving 2284 women. Interventions varied greatly and no consistent outcomes were measured. The review of trials found a lack of high‐quality evidence from trials and so the effects of antenatal education remain largely unknown. Further research is required to ensure that effective ways of helping health professionals support pregnant women and their partners in preparing for birth and parenting are investigated so that the resources used meet the needs of parents and their newborn infants.",CD002869
"Background Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynaecological condition with considerable morbidity. The behavioural approach assumes that psychological and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physiological processes. Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea may include both physical and cognitive procedures and focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for dysmenorrhoeic symptoms rather than modification of any underlying organic pathology. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of any behavioural interventions for the treatment of primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or conventional medical treatments for example non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched May 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1980 to May 2009), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2009), PsycINFO (1972 to May 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2009) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing behavioural interventions with placebo or other interventions in women with dysmenorrhoea. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Five trials involving 213 women were included.     Behavioural intervention vs control:  One trial of pain management training reported reduction in pain and symptoms compared to a control. Three trials of relaxation compared to control reported varied results, two trials showed no difference in symptom severity scores however one trial reported relaxation was effective for reducing symptoms in menstrual sufferers with spasmodic symptoms. Two trials reported less restriction in daily activities following treatment with either relaxation of pain management training compared to a control. One trial also reported less time absent from school following treatment wit pain management training compared to a control. Behavioural intervention vs other behavioural interventions : Three trials showed no difference between behavioural interventions for the outcome of improvement in symptoms. One trial showed that relaxation resulted in a decrease in the need for resting time compared to the relaxation and imagery. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence from five RCTs that behavioural interventions may be effective for dysmenorrhoea. However results should be viewed with caution as they varied greatly between trials due to inconsistency in the reporting of data, small trial size, poor methodological quality and age of the trials.","Behavioural interventions for dysmenorrhoea Dysmenorrhoea is a very common complaint that refers to painful menstrual cramps in the uterus (womb). When the pain is due to a recognised medical condition such as endometriosis it is called secondary dysmenorrhoea. When the pain is of unknown cause it is called primary dysmenorrhoea. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs or the contraceptive pill have been used as treatment for period pain but more women are looking for non‐drug therapies. Behavioural therapies assume that psychological (the mind) and environmental factors interact with, and influence, physical processes, for example stress might influence period pain. Behavioural therapies focus on both physical and psychological coping strategies for symptoms such as pain rather than focusing on medical solutions for any underlying causes of the symptoms. An example of a behavioural therapy is using relaxation to help a woman cope with painful period cramps. This review found that progressive muscle relaxation with or without imagery and relaxation may help with spasmodic (acute, cramping pain) symptoms of period pain. Also that pain management training and relaxation plus biofeedback may help with period pain in general. The results are not conclusive due to the small number of women in the trials and the poor methods used in some of the trials.",CD002248
"Background Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease. Infants are at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is currently recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but its benefit is uncertain. Objectives To assess the risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough in children and adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 4, 2010), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE Issue 4, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to January Week 1, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 18 January 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough in children and adults. Data collection and analysis Three to four review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Main results Thirteen trials with 2197 participants met the inclusion criteria: 11 trials investigated treatment regimens; two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. For eradicating  Bordetella pertussis  ( B. pertussis ) from the nasopharynx, short‐term antibiotics (azithromycin for three to five days, or clarithromycin or erythromycin for seven days) were as effective as long‐term (erythromycin for 10 to 14 days) (risk ratio (RR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.04), but had fewer side effects (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). Trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole for seven days was also effective. Nor were there differences in clinical outcomes or microbiological relapse between short and long‐term antibiotics. For preventing infection by treating contacts older than six months of age, antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms, nor the number of cases developing culture‐positive  B. pertussis . Side effects were reported with antibiotics and they varied from one antibiotic to another. Authors' conclusions Although antibiotics were effective in eliminating  B. pertussis , they did not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.","Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by pertussis bacteria and may lead to death, particularly in infants less than 12 months of age. Although it can be prevented by routine vaccination, it still affects many people. Thirteen trials involving 2197 participants were included in this review. We found that several antibiotic treatments were equally effective in eliminating the bacteria infecting patients, but they did not alter the clinical outcome. There was insufficient evidence to decide whether there is benefit for treating healthy contacts. Side effects were reported with antibiotics and they varied from one antibiotic to another. The result of the review should be interpreted with caution since this review is based on a limited number of trials and some of these trials involved small numbers of participants.",CD004404
"Background The severe and long‐lasting symptoms of schizophrenia are often the cause of severe disability. Environmental stress such as life events and the practical problems people face in their daily can worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia. Deficits in problem solving skills in people with schizophrenia affect their independent and interpersonal functioning and impair their quality of life. As a result, therapies such as problem solving therapy have been developed to improve problem solving skills for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effectiveness of problem solving therapy compared with other comparable therapies or routine care for those with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (September 2006), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised trials comparing problem solving therapy with other comparable therapies or routine care. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) using a random effects statistical model. Main results We included only three small trials (n=52) that evaluated problem solving versus routine care, coping skills training or non‐specific interaction. Inadequate reporting of data rendered many outcomes unusable. We were unable to undertake meta‐analysis. Overall results were limited and inconclusive with no significant differences between treatment groups for hospital admission, mental state, behaviour, social skills or leaving the study early. No data were presented for global state, quality of life or satisfaction. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the benefits of problem solving therapy as an additional treatment for those with schizophrenia. The small number of participants, the quality of reporting of methods and results were of concern. More trials with adequate reporting of methods to minimize bias, adequately powered, with validated, reliable and clinically meaningful outcomes are needed to provide robust evidence to guide policy and practice.","Problem solving skills for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often have lack the ability to solve problems arising from day to day living and stressful life events. These deficits can affect their ability to live independently, and contribute to disability and poor quality of life. Problem solving therapy is a psychological intervention designed to improve the ability of people with schizophrenia to approach problems in a systematic way and this therapy can be used in addition to antipsychotic medication and other supportive interventions. Problem solving therapy involves several key stages: (i) linking symptoms to problems, (ii) defining the problems, (iii) setting achievable goals, (iv) generating and choosing preferred solutions, (v) implementing preferred solutions and (vi) evaluating the result of the solution. If dealing more effectively with the problems of daily life were to reduce stress, it is possible that the risk of a relapse or increase in symptoms could be lowered. We evaluated the effectiveness of problem solving therapy compared with other comparable therapies or routine care for those with schizophrenia. We included three small randomised trials. The overall results were inconclusive and did not demonstrate a significant advantage for problem solving in affecting hospital admission, mental state, behaviour or social skills. We are currently unable, from the results of this review, to provide guidance to support or discourage the use of problem solving skills training as an additional treatment for people with schizophrenia.",CD006365
"Background Scientific findings must withstand critical review if they are to be accepted as valid, and editorial peer review (critique, effort to disprove) is an essential element of the scientific process. We review the evidence of the editorial peer‐review process of original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in biomedical journals. Objectives To estimate the effect of processes in editorial peer review. Search methods The following databases were searched to June 2004: CINAHL, Ovid, Cochrane Methodology Register, Dissertation abstracts, EMBASE, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews: ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed. Selection criteria We included prospective or retrospective comparative studies with two or more comparison groups, generated by random or other appropriate methods, and reporting original research, regardless of publication status. We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting. Data collection and analysis Because of the diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods, and outcomes, we carried out a descriptive review of included studies grouping them by broad study question. Main results We included 28 studies. We found no clear‐cut evidence of effect of the well‐researched practice of reviewer and/or author concealment on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9 studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have some evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of the outcome (1 study). Different methods of communicating with reviewers and means of dissemination do not appear to have an effect on quality (3 studies). On the basis of one study, little can be said about the ability of the peer‐review process to detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of peer review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area. Editorial peer review appears to make papers more readable and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence for this has very limited generalisability. Authors' conclusions At present, little empirical evidence is available to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research. However, the methodological problems in studying peer review are many and complex. At present, the absence of evidence on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be interpreted as evidence of their absence. A large, well‐funded programme of research on the effects of editorial peer review should be urgently launched.","Editorial peer review for improving the quality of reports of biomedical studies Editorial peer review is used world‐wide as a tool to assess and improve the quality of submissions to paper and electronic biomedical journals. As the information revolution gathers pace, an empirically proven method of quality assurance is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of empirical research on the possible effects of peer review led us to carry out a review of current evidence on the efficacy of editorial peer review. We found few studies of reasonable quality, and most of these were concerned with the effects of blinding reviewers and/or authors to each others' identity. We could not identify any methodologically convincing studies assessing the core effects of peer review. Major research is urgently needed.",MR000016
"Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus causing disease and death in solid organ transplant recipients during the first six months post‐transplant. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of antiviral medications used prophylactically or pre‐emptively in preventing CMV disease. In this review the efficacy of older agents (immunoglobulins (IgG), anti CMV vaccines and interferon) are examined. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of IgG, anti CMV vaccines or interferon for preventing symptomatic CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction.   Date of last search: December 2005 Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing IgG, anti CMV vaccine or interferon with placebo or no treatment, IgG alone or combined with antiviral medications with antiviral medications or IgG alone in recipients of any solid organ transplant. Data collection and analysis Two of four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Thirty seven studies (2185 participants) were included in this review. There was no significant difference in the risk for CMV disease (16 studies, 770 patients: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.05), CMV infection (14 studies, 775 patients: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.10) or all‐cause mortality (8 studies, 502 patients: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03) with IgG compared with placebo/no treatment. However IgG significantly reduced the risk of death from CMV disease (6 studies, 346 patients: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80). There was no difference in the risk for CMV disease (4 studies, 298 patients: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.86), CMV infection (4 studies, 298 patients: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.52) or all‐cause mortality (2 studies, 217 patients: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.29) between antiviral medication combined with IgG and antiviral medication alone. There was no significant difference in the risk of CMV disease with anti CMV vaccine or interferon compared with placebo or no treatment. Authors' conclusions Currently there are no indications for IgG in the prophylaxis of CMV disease in recipients of solid organ transplants.","Prophylaxis with Immunoglobulin G (IgG), anti CMV vaccine or interferon do not significantly reduce CMV disease and CMV‐associated mortality in solid organ transplant recipients Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus causing disease and death in solid organ transplant recipients (kidney, heart, liver, lung and pancreas) during the first six months after transplantation. This review looked at the benefits and harms of IgG, anti CMV vaccines and interferon to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. Thirty seven studies (2185 participants) were identified. This review shows that IgG did not reduce the risk of CMV disease or all‐cause mortality compared with placebo or no treatment. The combination of IgG with antiviral medications (aciclovir or ganciclovir) were not more effective than antiviral medications alone in reducing the risk of CMV disease or all‐cause mortality. Anti CMV vaccines and interferon did not reduce the risk of CMV disease compared with placebo or no treatment. Currently there are no indications for IgG in the prevention of CMV disease in recipients of solid organ transplants.",CD005129
"Background Many treatments are available for whiplash patients but there is little scientific evidence for their accepted use. Patients with whiplash‐associated disorders (WAD) can be classified by the severity of signs and symptoms from Grade 0 (no complaints or physical signs) to Grade 4 (fracture or dislocation). Objectives To assess the effectiveness of conservative treatment for patients with whiplash injuries rated as Grades 1 or 2 (neck and musculoskeletal complaints). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PEDro to November 2006 and screened references of identified randomised trials and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials published in English, French, German or Dutch, that included patients with a whiplash‐injury, conservative interventions, outcomes of pain, global perceived effect or participation in daily activities. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality using the Delphi criteria and extracted the data onto standardised data‐extraction forms. We did not pool the results because of the heterogeneity of the population, intervention and outcomes and lack of data. A pre‐planned stratified analysis was performed for three different comparisons. Main results Twenty‐three studies (2344 participants) were included in this update, including nine new studies. A broad variety of conservative interventions were evaluated. Two studies included patients with chronic symptoms (longer than three months), two included subacute (four to six weeks) symptoms, two had undefined duration of symptoms, and 17 studied patients with acute (less than three weeks) symptoms. Only eight studies (33.3%) satisfied one of our criteria of high quality, indicating overall, a poor methodological quality. Interventions were divided into passive (such as rest, immobilisation, ultrasound, etc) and active interventions (such as exercises, act as usual approach, etc.) and were compared with no treatment, a placebo or each other. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity and lack of data precluded pooling. Individual studies demonstrated effectiveness of one treatment over another, but the comparisons were varied and results inconsistent. Therefore, the evidence neither supports nor refutes the effectiveness of either passive or active treatments to relieve the symptoms of WAD, Grades 1 or 2. Authors' conclusions The current literature is of poor methodological quality and is insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Therefore, clearly effective treatments are not supported at this time for the treatment of acute, subacute or chronic symptoms of whiplash‐associated disorders.","Conservative treatments for whiplash Whiplash is defined as an acceleration‐deceleration mechanism of energy transfer to the neck. It may result from rear‐end or side‐impact motor vehicle collisions or during diving, among other mishaps. Whiplash‐associated disorders (WAD) can be classified by the severity of signs and symptoms from Grade 0 (no complaints or physical signs) to Grade 4 (fracture or dislocation). Whiplash‐associated disorders have been reported in 70 in 100,000 inhabitants in a Canadian province, to 188 to 325 per 100,000 inhabitants in The Netherlands. Conservative treatments (for example, physiotherapy, acupuncture, or a collar) are the most common treatment options for whiplash patients, but the evidence supporting their effectiveness remains conflicting. We included 23 studies (2344 participants with WAD Grades 1 or 2), nine of which were new for this update. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the studies included populations and interventions that were too different to pool. Two studies examined treatments for patients with chronic pain (longer than three months), two looked at subacute pain (four to six weeks), two were unclear (but one was probably chronic), and the rest looked at patients with acute symptoms of less than three weeks. In 11 studies, an active treatment approach (treatment strategy including exercises or advice to 'act as usual') was compared to a passive strategy, no treatment or was an additional treatment. Eight studies compared an active intervention with a passive one (the patient received a treatment such as advice to rest and wear a neck collar, an educational video, electrotherapy, manipulation, hot and cold packs, traction, or acupuncture). Eight studies compared an intervention with a placebo or no treatment. In seven studies, two active treatments were compared against each other and in one, a passive intervention was compared to injections. Since we were unable to pool any of the studies, we remain unable to either support or refute the effects of conservative treatments for acute, subacute or chronic whiplash‐associated disorders with the current evidence.",CD003338
"Background Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has adverse consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy. Metabolic acidosis may be corrected by oral bicarbonate supplementation or in dialysis patients by increasing the bicarbonate concentration in dialysate fluid. Objectives To examine the benefits and harms of treating metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, both prior to reaching end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) or whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT), with sodium bicarbonate or increasing the bicarbonate concentration of dialysate. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register [up to 4 March 2013] through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover RCTs and quasi‐RCTs investigating the correction of chronic metabolic acidosis in adults or children with CKD. Data collection and analysis Outcomes were analysed using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) for continuous measures. Main results We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta‐analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, with no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction. Authors' conclusions The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre‐ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.","There is limited evidence from three small trials suggesting that the correction of metabolic acidosis trials may have some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism In health, protein and amino acids remain in equilibrium however in CKD this balance is disturbed. Metabolic acidosis has been shown to have deleterious effects on protein balance, leading to a negative nitrogen balance, increased protein degradation, increased essential amino acid oxidation, reduced albumin synthesis and a lack of adaption to a low protein diet, and hence is associated with protein energy malnutrition, loss of lean body mass and muscle weakness. Metabolic acidosis is also a factor in the development of renal bone disease, as bone acts as a buffer for excess acid, with loss of mineral resulting from the increase in acid. This review found three small trials in adult haemodialysis patients (n = 117). The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre‐ESRD patients and none in children. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide strong evidence.",CD001890
"Background Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan‐Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique used for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current ""gold standard"". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described by Longo in 1998 as alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Early, small randomized‐controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery have shown it to be less painful and that it is associated with quicker recovery. The reports also suggest a better patient acceptance and a higher compliance with day‐case procedures potentially making it more economical. A previous Cochrane Review of stapled hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery has shown that the stapled technique is associated with a higher risk of recurrent hemorrhoids and some symptoms in long term follow‐up. Since this initial review, several more randomized controlled trials have been published that may shed more light on the differences between the novel stapled approach and conventional excisional techniques. Objectives This review compares the use of circular stapling devices and conventional excisional techniques in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids. Its goal is to ascertain whether there is any difference in the outcomes of the two techniques in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Search methods We searched all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1998 to December 2009. Selection criteria All randomized controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional excisional hemorrhoidal surgeries with a minimum follow‐up period of 6 months were included. Data collection and analysis Data were collected on a data sheet. When appropriate, an Odds Ratio was generated using a random effects model. Main results Patients with SH were significantly more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids in long term follow up at all time points than those with CH (12 trials, 955 patients, OR 3.22, CI 1.59‐6.51, p=0.001). There were 37 recurrences out of 479 patients in the stapled group versus only 9 out of 476 patients in the conventional group. Similarly, in trials where there was follow up of one year or more, SH was associated with a greater proportion of patients with hemorrhoid recurrence (5 trials, 417 patients, OR 3.60, CI 1.24‐10.49, p=0.02). Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients with SH complained of the symptom of prolapse at all time points (13 studies, 1191 patients, OR 2.65, CI 1.45‐4.85, p=0.002). In studies with follow up of greater than one year, the same significant outcome was found (7 studies, 668 patients, OR 3.14, CI 1.20‐8.22, p=0.02). Patients undergoing SH were more likely to require an additional operative procedure compared to those who underwent CH (8 papers, 553 patients, OR 2.75, CI 1.31‐5.77, p=0.008). When all symptoms were considered, patients undergoing CH surgery were more likely to be asymptomatic (12 trials, 1097 patients, OR 0.59, CI 0.40‐0.88). Non significant trends in favor of SH were seen in pain, pruritis ani, and fecal urgency. All other clinical parameters showed trends favoring CH. Authors' conclusions Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long‐term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. It is also associated with a higher likelihood of long‐term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. If hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes, then conventional excisional surgery remains the ""gold standard"" in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.","Conventional surgical hemorrhoidectomy results in fewer recurrences than stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan‐Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique used for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current ""gold standard"". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described in 1998 as alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy.  A review of randomized control trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery was conducted. The results show that the stapled technique is associated with a higher risk of recurrent hemorrhoids and some symptoms in long term follow‐up. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled homorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy.",CD005393
"Background Epidemiological evidence on the effects of potassium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Objectives To evaluate the effects of potassium supplementation on health outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. Selection criteria Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral potassium supplements with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow‐up >=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=85 mmHg); 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow‐up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or potassium supplementation was combined with other interventions. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta‐analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Main results Six RCT's (n=483), with 8‐16 weeks follow‐up, met our inclusion criteria. Meta‐analysis of five trials (n=425) with adequate data indicated that potassium supplementation compared to control resulted in a large but statistically non‐significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: ‐11.2, 95% CI: ‐25.2 to 2.7) and DBP (mean difference: ‐5.0, 95% CI: ‐12.5 to 2.4). The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by potassium dose, quality of trials or baseline blood pressure. Excluding one trial in an African population with very high baseline blood pressure resulted in smaller overall reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: ‐3.9, 95% CI: ‐8.6 to 0.8; DBP mean difference: ‐1.5, 95% CI: ‐6.2 to 3.1). Further sensitivity analysis restricted to two high quality trials (n=138) also found non‐significant reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: ‐7.1, 95% CI: ‐19.9 to 5.7; DBP mean difference: ‐5.5, 95% CI: ‐14.5 to 3.5). Authors' conclusions Potassium supplementation has no statistically significant effect on blood pressure. Due to small number of participants in the two high quality trials, the short duration of follow‐up, and the unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the evidence about the effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure is not conclusive. Further high quality RCTs of longer duration are required to clarify whether potassium supplementation can reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes.","Oral potassium supplementation for high blood pressure in adults This review examines whether taking potassium supplements can be recommended for treating adults with high blood pressure from no known cause. The results of the trials varied a lot: some trials found potassium lowered blood pressure much more than a dummy drug (placebo), while others found little difference between potassium and placebo. Overall no significant reduction in blood pressure from taking potassium supplements was found. Most included trials were of poor quality, so their results may not be reliable. The trials were not long enough or large enough to measure whether potassium supplements reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke, which may be caused by high blood pressure. The studies reporting adverse effects did not find any serious side effects from taking potassium supplements. This review does not confirm whether potassium supplements can lower high blood pressure and therefore does not recommend them for treating hypertension. More trials enrolling a large number of participants with long periods of follow‐up are necessary to know whether or not potassium supplements can lower high blood pressure.",CD004641
"Background Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is a progressive condition that has no cure and often requires a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The principal methods for THA are the posterior and direct lateral approaches. The posterior approach is considered to be easy to perform, however, increased rates of dislocation have been reported. The direct lateral approach facilitates cup positioning which may decrease rates of hip dislocation and diminishes the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve. However, there is an increased risk of limp. Dislocation of a hip prosthesis is a clinically important complication after THA, in terms of morbidity implications and costs. Objectives To determine the risks of prosthesis dislocation, postoperative Trendelenburg gait and sciatic nerve palsy after a posterior approach, compared to a direct lateral approach, for adult patients undergoing THA for primary OA and to update the previous review made in 2003. Search methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched and updated, from the previous search of 2002, to Oct 13, 2005. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Published trials comparing posterior and direct lateral surgical approaches to THA in participants 18 years and older with a diagnosis of primary hip OA. Data collection and analysis Retrieved articles were assessed independently by the two reviewers for their methodological quality. Main results Four prospective cohort studies involving 241 participants met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, dislocation, was reported in two studies. No significant difference between posterior and direct lateral surgical approach was found [1/77 (1.3%) versus 3/72 (4.2%); relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.04 to 3.22]. The presence of postoperative Trendelenburg gait was not significantly different between these surgical approaches. The risk of nerve palsy or injury (all nerves taken together) was significantly higher among the direct lateral approaches [1/43 (2%) versus 10/49 (20%); RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.83]. However, there were no significant differences when comparing this risk nerve by nerve for both approaches, in particular for the sciatic nerve. Of the other outcomes considered only the average range of internal rotation in extension of the hip was significantly higher (weighted mean difference 16 degrees, 95% CI 8 to 23) in the posterior approach group (mean 35°, standard deviation 13°) compared to the direct lateral approach (mean 19°, standard deviation 13°). Authors' conclusions The quality and quantity of information extracted from the trials performed to date are insufficient to make any firm conclusion on the optimum choice of surgical approach in adult patients undergoing primary THA for OA.","Total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of a posterior or lateral approach in total hip replacement surgery for osteoarthritis. The review shows that: In people with osteoarthritis of the hip, there is not enough evidence to be certain about whether the posterior (back) or the lateral (side) approach to total hip replacement surgery is better. What is osteoarthritis of the hip and what types of total hip replacement surgery are there?    Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hips. In some people, the damage and pain in the hip may be severe enough for surgery. In these people, the whole hip joint can be replaced by an artificial joint with total hip replacement surgery. In total hip replacement surgery, the surgeon can make the cut from the posterior (back) or lateral (side) of the hip. Some surgeons believe that the posterior approach is better because people may have less problems walking after surgery. Other surgeons believe that the lateral approach is better because people may have less chance of nerve damage and less chance of dislocating their hip after surgery. Dislocating a hip causes pain and people may need to go to hospital to put the hip back in place. What are the results of this review?    People in the studies had total hip replacement surgery that was either done from the posterior (back of the hip) or from the lateral (side of the hip). Benefits of posterior and lateral approach    In people who had total hip replacement surgery: the posterior approach may improve range of motion more than the lateral approach   the posterior and lateral approaches may improve function about the same But there is not enough evidence to be certain about these benefits.     Harms of posterior and lateral approach    In people who had total hip replacement surgery: the chance of dislocating the hip after surgery may be about the same with either the posterior or lateral approach   the chance of having difficulty walking may be about the same with either the posterior or lateral approach   the posterior approach may cause less nerve damage than the lateral approach But there is not enough evidence to be certain about these harms.",CD003828
"Background Women at risk of pre‐eclampsia or gestational hypertension are sometimes advised to rest. Whether this, overall, does more good than harm is unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of rest or advice to reduce physical activity during pregnancy for preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2010). Selection criteria Studies were included if they were randomised trials evaluating the effects of rest or advise to reduce physical activity for preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Data were double checked for accuracy. Main results Two small trials (106 women) of uncertain quality were included. Both recruited women with a singleton pregnancy at moderate risk of pre‐eclampsia from 28 to 32 weeks' gestation. There was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of pre‐eclampsia with four to six hours rest per day (one trial, 32 women; relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.83), but not of gestational hypertension (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.00), compared to normal activity. Rest of 30 minutes per day plus nutritional supplementation was associated with a reduction in the risk of pre‐eclampsia (one trial, 74 women; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51) and also of gestational hypertension (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.63). The effect on caesarean section was unclear (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.41). No other outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions Daily rest, with or without nutrient supplementation, may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia for women with normal blood pressure, although the reported effect may reflect bias and/or random error rather than a true effect. There is no information about outcomes such as perinatal mortality and morbidity, maternal morbidity, women's views, adverse effects, and costs. Current evidence is insufficient to support recommending rest or reduced activity to women for preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications. Whether women rest during pregnancy should therefore be a matter of personal choice.","Rest during pregnancy for preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure Not enough evidence to say if rest is helpful in preventing pre‐eclampsia and its complications for women with normal blood pressure during pregnancy. Pre‐eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Rest has been proposed as being beneficial for women at increased risk of pre‐eclampsia, including those with normal blood pressure. There are also possible adverse effects such as the potential for increasing the risk of blood clots in the legs, and the impact considerable periods of rest on women's lives and that of their families. The review of trials found two small studies, of not very good quality, and there were insufficient data to say what the potential benefits and harms might be. Further studies are needed, and in the meantime women will be guided by their own beliefs and reasoning, as well as those of their caregivers.",CD005939
"Background Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have become established as effective controller medications for children and adults with asthma, but their relative efficacy is not clear. Objectives To compare the relative effectiveness and adverse effects of ICS and SCG among children and adults with chronic asthma. Search methods Systematic search of the Cochrane Airways Group's special register of controlled trials (to Feb. 2004), hand searches of the reference lists of included trials and relevant review papers, and written requests for identification of additional trials from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of ICS with SCG in children and adults with chronic asthma. Data collection and analysis All studies were assessed independently for eligibility by three review authors. Disagreements were settled by consensus. Trial authors were contacted to supply missing data or to verify methods. Eligible studies were abstracted and fixed‐ and random‐effects models were implemented to pool studies. Separate analyses were conducted for paediatric and adult studies. Subgroup analyses and meta‐regression models were fit to explore heterogeneity of lung function outcomes by type of RCT, category of ICS or SCG dosage, asthma severity of participants, and study quality on outcomes. Main results Of 67 identified studies, 17 trials involving 1279 children and eight trials involving 321 adults with asthma were eligible. Thirteen (76%) of the paediatric studies and six (75%) of the adult studies were judged to be high quality. Among children, ICS were associated with a higher final mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.07 litres, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.11) and higher mean final peak expiratory flow rate [PEF] (WMD 17.3 litres/minute, 95% CI 11.3 to 23.3) than SCG. In addition, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD ‐1.18 exacerbations per year, 95% CI ‐2.15 to ‐ 0.21), lower asthma symptom scores, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no group differences in the proportion of children with adverse effects. Among adults, ICS were similarly associated with a higher mean final FEV1 (WMD 0.21 litres, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) and a higher final endpoint PEF (WMD 28.2 litres/minute, 95% CI 18.7 to 37.6) than SCG. ICS were also associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD ‐3.30 exacerbations per year, 95% CI ‐5.62 to ‐0.98), lower asthma symptom scores among cross‐over trials but not parallel trials, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no differences in the proportion of adults with adverse effects. In subgroup analyses involving lung function measures, paediatric and adult studies judged to be of high quality had results consistent with the overall results. Lung function measures in children were higher in studies with medium BDP‐equivalent steroid dosages than low BDP‐equivalent dosages, while adult studies could not be compared by steroid dosage since they all incorporated similar dosages. There were no significant differences in lung function by the asthma severity of participants for adult or child studies. Authors' conclusions ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung function and asthma control for both adults and children with chronic asthma. There were few studies reporting on quality of life and health care utilization, which limited our ability to adequately evaluate the relative effects of these medications on a broader range of outcomes. Although there were no differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, most trials were short and may not have been of sufficient duration to identify long‐term effects. Our results support recent consensus statements in the U.S. and elsewhere that favour the use of ICS over SCG for control of persistent asthma.","Inhaled corticosteroids versus sodium cromoglycate in children and adults with asthma Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) have been advocated as medications to control persistent asthma symptoms among children and adults, yet information on which class of drugs is superior has been conflicting. This study pooled randomized controlled trials that directly compared the effects of ICS to SCG on measures of lung function, asthma control, and health care use. Results suggest that ICS were superior to SCG on measures of lung function and morbidity. The results were consistent among children and adults. There were no differences in adverse effects between ICS and SCG, although inconsistent reporting and insufficient long‐term monitoring prevents firm conclusions on safety from being drawn.",CD003558
"Background A malaria vaccine is badly needed. SPf66 was one of the earliest vaccines developed. It is a synthetic peptide vaccine containing antigens from the blood stages of malaria linked together with an antigen from the sporozoite stage, and is targeted mainly against the blood (asexual) stages.

Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2008), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2008), EMBASE (1980 to March 2008), LILACS (1982 to March 2008), Science Citation Index (1981 to March 2008), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted organizations and researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing SPf66 vaccine with placebo or routine antimalarial control measures in people of any age receiving an artificial challenge or natural exposure to malaria infection (any species). Data collection and analysis Two people independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including adverse events. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Ten efficacy trials of SPf66 involving 9698 participants were included. Results with SPf66 in reducing new episodes of  P. falciparum  malaria were heterogeneous: it was not effective in four African trials (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 2371 participants) or in one Asian trial (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; 1221 participants). In four trials in South America the number of first attacks with  P. falciparum  was reduced by 28% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 3807 participants). It did not reduce episodes of  P. vivax  malaria or admission to hospital with severe malaria. Trials have not indicated any serious adverse events with SPf66 vaccine. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence for protection by SPf66 vaccines against  P. falciparum  in Africa. There is a modest reduction in attacks of  P. falciparum  malaria following vaccination with SPf66 in South America. There is no justification for further trials of SPf66 in its current formulation. Further research with SPf66 vaccines in South America or with new formulations of SPf66 may be justified. 23 April 2019 No update planned Intervention not in general use or been superseded This intervention is no longer available.","The SPf66 vaccine has little or no effect on preventing malaria The SPf66 vaccine was one of the first malaria vaccines to be tested extensively in endemic areas. SPf66 is a synthetic peptide vaccine containing antigens from the blood stages of malaria linked together with an antigen from the sporozoite stage. SPf66 has had 10 trials in Africa, Asia, and South America. Results were initially promising, but further trials showed only a small effect in some trials, and no effect in Africa. There is no evidence that SPf66 is effective enough to be introduced on a routine basis for prevention of malaria.",CD005966
"Background The use of peripheral intravenous cannulae is common in newborn babies. Many of them require an intravenous line only for medications and not for fluid. Currently there is little uniformity in methods used to maintain cannula patency. Objectives The object of this review was to determine which method was better for maintaining intravenous lines used in neonates for intravenous medication only: intermittent flushing or continuous infusion Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), CINAHL (from 1982 to June 2004) and MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 2004) . Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing continuous infusion to intermittent flushing to maintain patency of intravenous cannulas. Units of randomisation might include individual catheters or individual babies. Data collection and analysis Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Two studies were eligible for inclusion. In one study only one of our primary outcomes was available: the duration of cannula patency for the first cannula used per infant was slightly longer in the continuous infusion group, but not significantly so, with a mean difference of ‐4.3 hours (95% CI ‐18.2 to 9.7). In the second study, only one of our primary outcomes was available: the mean (SD) number cannulas used per infant in the first 48 hours was less in the intermittent flush group with a mean difference of ‐0.76 cannulas (95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.15). No results were available for any of our other primary outcomes: in the published report, results were reported per catheter rather than per infant, a number of infants received more than one intravenous catheter (39 infants received an unknown number of catheters). The overall duration of cannula patency was significantly longer in the intermittent flush group with a mean duration of patency in the intermittent flush group of 2.1 days (SD 1.0) compared with the continuous infusion group where the mean duration of patency was 1.0 days (SD 0.5) ‐ Student's t test P value 0.0003. Authors' conclusions It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions given the way the data were analysed and reported in the two included studies. The reliability of the results is uncertain. However, given the caution in interpreting these data, it should also be noted that the use of intermittent flushes was not associated in either study with a decreased cannula life or any other disadvantages, thus lending some support for the use of intermittent flushing of cannulas in a selected population in neonatal nurseries.","Continuous infusion versus intermittent flushing to prevent loss of function of peripheral intravenous catheters used for drug administration in newborn infants The best way to keep a newborn baby's intravenous line working is still unknown. We aimed to find out which was the better way to keep a newborn baby's intravenous line open and working ‐‐ either running a continuous amount of intravenous fluid through it (continuous infusion) or giving a small amount of fluid through it every few hours (intermittent flush) only. One study showed no difference between the two approaches for keeping a baby's intravenous line open and working and one study showed an advantage for intermittent flushes. The studies, however, had some problems in how the data were analysed and reported. Therefore, we are uncertain as to how reliable the results are and further research should be undertaken.",CD004593
"Background Dysmenorrhoea is the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a very common gynaecological complaint with negative effect on a sufferer's quality of life. Medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea includes oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which both act by suppressing prostaglandin levels. While these treatments are very successful there is still a 20 to 25% failure rate and surgery has been an option for such cases. Uterine nerve ablation (UNA) and presacral neurectomy (PSN) are two surgical treatments that have become increasingly utilised in recent years due to advances in laparoscopic procedures. These procedures both interrupt the majority of the cervical sensory pain nerve fibres. Observational studies have supported the use of these procedures for primary dysmenorrhoea. However, both operations only partially interrupt the cervical sensory nerve fibres in the pelvic area and, therefore, this type of surgery may not always benefit women with dysmenorrhoea. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways as treatment for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea, and to determine the most effective surgical treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 9 June 2004), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to Nov 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Nov 2003), and CINAHL (1982 to Oct 2003). Attempts were also made to identify trials from the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the citation lists of review articles and included trials. In most cases the first or corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. Selection criteria The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of surgical techniques of interruption of the pelvic nerve pathways (using both open and laparoscopic procedures) for the treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea. The main outcome measures were pain relief and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Eleven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that initially appeared to fulfil the inclusion criteria for this review. Two trials were subsequently excluded (Garcia Leon 2003; Sutton 1991). Of the remaining nine trials, eight were included in the meta‐analysis. The results of one trial were included in the text of the review for discussion because the data were not available in a form that allowed them to be combined in the meta‐analysis. Five trials investigated laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA), two trials laparoscopic presacral neurectomy (LPSN) and two open presacral neurectomy (PSN). Main results For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea there was some evidence of the effectiveness of laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA) when compared to a control or no treatment. The comparison between LUNA and laparoscopic presacral neurectomy (LPSN) for primary dysmenorrhoea showed no significant difference in pain relief in the short term; however, long‐term LPSN was shown to be significantly more effective than LUNA. For the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhoea six identified RCTs addressed endometriosis and one included women with uterine myomas. The treatment of LUNA combined with surgical treatment of endometrial implants versus surgical treatment of endometriosis alone showed that the addition of LUNA did not aid pain relief. For PSN combined with endometriosis treatment versus endometriosis treatment alone there was an overall difference in pain relief although the data suggests this may be specific to laparoscopy and for midline abdominal pain only. Adverse events were significantly more common for presacral neurectomy; however, the majority were complications such as constipation, which may spontaneously improve. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea, regardless of cause. Future methodologically sound and sufficiently powered RCTs should be undertaken.",Not enough evidence to support the use of surgical nerve interruption for dysmenorrhoea Dysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps) is a common problem. The contraceptive pill and anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective treatments in 80% of women with dysmenorrhoea but for others surgery is a considered option. Uterine nerve ablation (UNA) and presacral neurectomy (PSN) both involve surgical interruption of the sensory nerve fibres near the cervix to block the pain pathway. The review of trials found there was only limited evidence to support the use of surgery for primary dysmenorrhoea and little evidence for its use in women with endometriosis. No adverse effects were found with UNA but PSN was found to cause treatable constipation. More research is needed.,CD001896
"Background Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is of proven benefit in recently‐symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis. Its role in asymptomatic stenosis is still debated. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) more than doubled the number of patients randomised to CEA trials. This revised review incorporates the recently published ACST results. Objectives To determine the effects of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), Current Contents (1995 to January 1997), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers in the field to identify additional published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria All completed randomised trials comparing CEA to medical treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Attempts were made to contact investigators to obtain missing information. Main results Three trials with a total of 5223 patients were included. In these trials, the overall net excess of operation‐related perioperative stroke or death was 2.9%. For the primary outcome of perioperative stroke or death or any subsequent stroke, patients undergoing CEA fared better than those treated medically (relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83). Similarly, for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, there was benefit for the surgical group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90). For the outcome of any stroke or death, there was a non‐significant trend towards fewer events in the surgical group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). Subgroup analyses were performed for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent carotid stroke. CEA appeared more beneficial in men than in women and more beneficial in younger patients than in older patients although the data for age effect were inconclusive. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment effect estimates in patients with different grades of stenosis but the data were insufficient. Authors' conclusions Despite about a 3% perioperative stroke or death rate, CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis reduces the risk of ipsilateral stroke, and any stroke, by approximately 30% over three years. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (approximately 1% per annum over the first few years of follow up in the two largest and most recent trials) but it could be higher with longer follow up.","Carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis For most people with a narrowing of the carotid artery which is not causing symptoms a surgical operation to remove the narrowing carries a risk and has little benefit. Carotid stenosis is a narrowing of a major artery in the neck taking blood to the brain. This can cause a stroke. If the narrowing is severe and has caused symptoms, surgery to remove the narrowing (carotid endarterectomy) reduces the risk of stroke. However, if the narrowing has not caused any symptoms the risk of stroke is not very high. Although this low risk can be lowered further by surgery, the surgery itself can sometimes cause a stroke or death. The overall effect of surgery is a small benefit.",CD001923
"Background Umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) are often used in ill neonates. Infection related to the use of these catheters may cause significant morbidity and mortality. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has been advocated for newborns with umbilical venous catheters in order to reduce the risk of colonisation and acquired infection. Prophylactic antibiotics may be effective in preventing catheter‐related blood stream infection, but may have the undesirable effect of promoting the emergence of resistant strains of micro‐organisms. Objectives The primary objective was to assess whether prophylactic antibiotics in neonates with UVCs reduce mortality and morbidity. In separate comparisons, we planned to review two different policies regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics in neonates with umbilical venous catheters: 1) Among neonates with UVCs, a policy of prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of catheterization (or other fixed duration of antibiotic treatment) versus placebo or no treatment; 2) Among neonates with UVCs who had been started on antibiotics at the time of catheterization, but whose initial cultures to rule out sepsis are negative, a policy of continuing versus discontinuing prophylactic antibiotics. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), CINAHL (1982 to April 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005). This search was updated in November 2010. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised trials in which newborn infants with UVCs are randomised to receive prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Main results One poor quality study met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Twenty‐nine term infants, who had UVCs inserted specifically for transfusion procedures for hyperbilirubinaemia or polycythaemia, allocated non‐randomly (alternate allocation) to treatment (n = 15) or control (n = 14) groups. Those in the treatment group received penicillin and gentamicin for three days. 5/15 infants given antibiotics and 5/14 control infants having positive blood cultures three days after catheter insertion. All positive blood cultures were considered contaminated, due to lack of corroborating clinical and haematological evidence of infection. Therefore, no infants were identified with evidence of septicaemia. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics when UVCs are inserted in newborn infants. There is no evidence to support or refute continuing antibiotics once initial cultures rule out infection in newborn infants with UVCs.","Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in neonates with umbilical venous catheters There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to either support or refute the routine use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with umbilical vein catheters. Sick newborn babies occasionally require the insertion of an umbilical vein catheter (a special tube) that goes into the vein in the umbilicus (belly button). This allows fluid and medicines to be given. Some people believe that antibiotics should be given to all babies with umbilical vein catheters in order to reduce the chance of infection occurring. However, antibiotics can have unwanted effects. The reviewers found insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of antibiotics for all babies with umbilical vein catheters.",CD005251
"Background Ginkgo biloba extract is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China. We aimed to assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials on the use of Ginkgo biloba extract in acute ischaemic stroke. Objectives The primary objective was to determine whether Ginkgo biloba extract improves functional outcome without causing undue harm in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on neurological impairment and quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched October 2004), the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (last searched October 2004) and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched June 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), AMED (1985 to May 2002) and the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM‐disc, 1979 to August 2004). We searched relevant clinical trials and research registers and contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers in an effort to identify further published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials comparing Ginkgo biloba extract with placebo or open control (no placebo) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Main results Fourteen trials were identified, of which 10 trials (792 patients) were included. Four trials are awaiting assessment. In the 10 included trials follow up was performed at 14 to 35 days after stroke. In all studies neurological outcome was assessed but none of them reported on disability (activities of daily living function) or quality of life. Only three trials reported adverse events. In nine trials, all of them assessed to be of inferior quality, significant improvement in neurological deficit at the end of the treatment was used as the outcome measure. When analysing these trials together, Ginkgo biloba extract was associated with a significant increase in the number of improved patients (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 3.94). One placebo‐controlled trial, assessed to be of good quality, reported neurological outcome as a continuous variable. It failed to show an improvement of neurological deficit at the end of treatment (weighted mean difference (fixed) 0.81; 95% CI ‐8.9 to 10.52). No deaths or major adverse events were reported during the follow‐up period. Authors' conclusions There was no convincing evidence from trials of sufficient methodological quality to support the routine use of Ginkgo biloba extract to promote recovery after stroke. High‐quality and large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to test its efficacy.","Ginkgo biloba for acute ischaemic stroke Ginkgo biloba extract, a Chinese traditional medicine, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China and is also used occasionally in Europe but its efficacy is uncertain. There is limited experimental support for the use of Ginkgo biloba extract in ischaemic stroke. Hence, it has been shown that Ginkgo biloba extract leads to a significant increase in cerebral blood flow and glucose uptake into brain tissue. This review identified all randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of Ginkgo biloba extract in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. There was no convincing evidence, from trials of sufficient methodological quality, to support the routine use of Ginkgo biloba extract to promote recovery after stroke. High‐quality and large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to test its efficacy.",CD003691
"Background Acyclovir has the potential to shorten the course of illness which may result in reduced costs and morbidity associated with chickenpox. Objectives To examine the evidence evaluating the efficacy of acyclovir in alleviating symptoms of chickenpox and shortening the duration of illness.   To examine complications of chickenpox and adverse effects associated with acyclovir as reported in the relevant trials. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library,  2008, issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to Septemer Week 3, 2008), and EMBASE (1974 to September 2008). The reference lists of all relevant articles were reviewed. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that evaluated otherwise healthy children zero to 18 years of age, with chickenpox. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed the studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the relevant studies using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted by one review author using a structured form and checked by a second. Continuous data were converted to the weighted mean difference (WMD). Weighted mean differences were combined into an overall estimate using random effects. There were too few studies to consider exploring statistical heterogeneity between studies (i.e., differences in reported effects), formally, or to assess for publication bias. Main results Three studies were included. Study quality was three (n = 2) and four (n = 1) on the Jadad scale. Acyclovir was associated with a reduction in the number of days with fever (‐1.1 days, 95% CI ‐1.3 to ‐0.9) and in reducing the maximum number of lesions (‐76 lesions, ‐145 to ‐8). Results were less supportive with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and the number of days to the relief of itching. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications associated with chickenpox or adverse effects associated with the treatment. Authors' conclusions Acyclovir appears to be effective in reducing the number of days with fever and the maximum number of lesions among otherwise healthy children with chickenpox. The results were less convincing with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and relief of itchiness. The clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children remains uncertain.","Acyclovir can reduce the number of days with fever in otherwise healthy children with chickenpox, but its effect on sores and itching is not yet certain Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by a virus. It begins with a fever, followed by a rash of red pimples which become itchy sores that form scabs. Chickenpox usually affects children from one to 14 years. In young babies, adults or people with impaired immune system, chickenpox is more severe. Treatments include lotions to relieve itchiness, paracetamol (acetaminophen) for fever and the antiviral drug acyclovir. The review of trials found that acyclovir reduces the number of days of fever from chickenpox in otherwise healthy children, usually without adverse effects. It is not clear whether it improves sores and itching.",CD002980
"Background The addition of a long acting beta agonist (LABA) to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy can improve asthma symptoms and reduce exacerbations. The addition of LABA may also have an ICS‐sparing effect and permit a reduction in ICS maintenance dose. Objectives To determine the efficacy of adding LABA to maintenance ICS therapy in reducing the requirement for ICS while maintaining control of chronic asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: November 2004 Selection criteria Parallel RCTs that compared reduced dose ICS in combination with LABA vs ICS alone in asthmatics requiring daily ICS. Data collection and analysis Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation. Trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: a fixed moderate/high dose or a reduced/tapering dose of the same ICS. Main results 19 publications describing 10 trials of adults were included in the review. Studies that compared reduced dose (mean 60% reduction) ICS/LABA combination to a fixed moderate/high dose ICS found no significant difference in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.32), withdrawal due to worsening asthma (RR 0.82, 95%CI 0.5 to 1.35) or airway inflammation. There were also significant improvements in FEV1 (change from baseline WMD 0.10, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.12), morning & evening PEF and percent rescue free days with LABA. Two studies provided outcomes for a reduced/tapering ICS dose comparison. More participants receiving the LABA/reduced ICS combination achieved a reduction in ICS dose reaching significance in one study. A significant reduction of 253 mcg BDP was achieved in one study. Authors' conclusions In adults with asthma, using moderate to high maintenance doses of ICS, the addition of LABA has an ICS‐sparing effect. The addition of LABA permits more participants on minimum maintenance ICS to reduce ICS. The precise magnitude of the ICS dose reduction requires further study.","Long‐acting beta2‐agonists as an inhaled corticosteroid‐sparing agent for chronic asthma in adults and children The combination of long acting beta agonist (LABA) with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is used frequently in asthma and a benefit from adding LABA to ICS has been described.

In adults with asthma, who use moderate to high maintenance doses of ICS, the addition of LABA has an ICS‐sparing effect. LABA permit a reduction of 37% (253 mcg BDP) in subjects on minimum maintenance ICS and up to 60% (300 mcg FP) in subjects on maintenance ICS without deterioration in asthma control.",CD005076
"Background In non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is a relatively high incidence of brain metastases following radical treatment. At present, the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in this group of patients is not clear. This is an update of the original review published in 2005. Objectives To investigate whether PCI has a role in the management of patients with NSCLC treated with radical intent. Search methods The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (The Cochrane library) and LILACS, along with handsearching of journals, relevant books, and review articles used to identify potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCI with no PCI in NSCLC patients treated with radical intent. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to the small patient numbers, and variations in radiotherapy (RT) dose, no meta‐analysis was attempted. Main results Four RCTs have been included in this review. No further trials were found to be eligible in this update. Only one new trial investigating the role of PCI has been carried out since the original review and is only published in the abstract form (RTOG 0214) . PCI may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit. There is no evidence that any regimen is superior, and the effect of PCI on quality of life (QOL) is not known. Authors' conclusions This update of the review published in 2005 does not contain any new trials published in full. One new trial that has only been published as an abstract, does not show any benefit in overall survival in patients receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PCI in clinical practice. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial.","There is no evidence to recommend that patients with non‐small cell lung cancer receive prophylactic radiotherapy to the brain following potentially curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy Patients with non‐small cell lung cancer have a significant risk of developing tumour spread (metastases) to the brain after potentially curative treatment.

"Background Most persons with prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose) are overweight, and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with this condition. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary, physical activity, and behavioral weight loss, and weight control interventions for adults with prediabetes. Search methods Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic dababases, supplemented by hand searches of selected journals, and consultation with experts in obesity research. The last search was conducted May, 2004. Selection criteria Studies were included if they were published or unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language and examined weight loss or weight control strategies using one or more dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions, with a follow‐up interval of at least 12 months. Data collection and analysis Effects were combined using a random‐effects model. Main results Nine studies were identified, with a total of 5,168 participants. Follow‐up ranged from 1 to 10 years. Quantitative synthesis was limited by the heterogeneity of populations, settings, and interventions and by the small number of studies that examined outcomes other than weight. Overall, in comparisons with usual care, four studies with a follow‐up of one year reduced weight by 2.8 kg (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 4.7) (3.3% of baseline body weight) and decreased body mass index by 1.3 kg/m 2  (95% CI 0.8 to 1.9). Weight loss at two years was 2.6 kg (95% CI 1.9 to 3.3) (three studies). Modest improvements were noted in the few studies that examined glycemic control, blood pressure, or lipid concentrations (P > 0.05). No data on quality of life or mortality were found. The incidence of diabetes was significantly lower in the intervention groups versus the controls in three of five studies examining this outcome at 3 to 6 years follow‐up. Authors' conclusions Overall, weight loss strategies using dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced significant improvements in weight among persons with prediabetes and a significant decrease in diabetes incidence. Further work is needed on the long‐term effects of these interventions on morbidity and mortality and on how to implement these interventions in diverse community settings.","Long‐term non‐pharmacological weight loss interventions for adults with prediabetes Persons with blood glucose levels that are abnormal, but not in the range of persons with diabetes, are said to have prediabetes, which often precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. Most persons with prediabetes are overweight and obesity worsens the blood glucose and other problems associated with prediabetes. In this review we found that dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced significant improvements in weight among persons with prediabetes and a significant decrease in diabetes incidence. Modest, but not statistically significant improvements were noted in the few studies that examined blood sugar control, blood pressure, and lipid levels. No data on quality of life or mortality were found.",CD005270
"Background In the fixation of intracapsular hip fractures, different implants, surgical approaches and ancillary manoeuvres have been employed to improve the reduction, and the stability of the reconstruction, in an attempt to reduce the frequency of non‐union and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Objectives To compare alternative surgical approaches and ancillary techniques in internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures which have been subjected to randomised and quasi‐randomised trials in adults. Search methods The Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Date of the most recent search: November 2004. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials investigating operative technique for the treatment of intracapsular hip fractures. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality, by use of a 10 item checklist, and extracted data. Main results One trial with 103 participants studied the effect of impaction of the fracture at the time of surgery. The only outcome measure reported was bone scintimetry. There was some evidence that impaction, particularly of displaced fractures, resulted in a reduction of blood flow to the femoral head as assessed by bone scintimetry. One quasi‐randomised trial with 220 participants compared compression of the fracture with no compression. Results for 156 individuals at one year showed a tendency to a lower incidence of non‐union for those fractures treated without compression. Two trials, one involving 102 young adults under 50 years old and the other involving 49 older people aged 65 years or over, compared open versus closed reduction of the fracture. Both found open reduction significantly increased length of surgery. None of the other differences between open and closed reduction in the outcomes reported by the two trials were statistically significant. Authors' conclusions Insufficient evidence exists from randomised trials to confirm the relative effects of open versus closed reduction of intracapsular fractures, or the effects of intra‐operative impaction or compression of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation.",Not enough evidence to show which surgical technique is preferable for internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures Hip fractures located within the hip joint capsule (intracapsular hip fractures) may be surgically fixed using a variety of different implants and surgical techniques. This review examines the effects of different surgical techniques. It found insufficient evidence from randomised trials to assess the effects of compression or of impaction of the fracture during surgery. It found limited evidence that open reduction (surgically exposed) as compared with closed reduction (under X‐ray control) resulted in a greater length of surgery. The lack of evidence showing benefit of open reduction supports the use of closed reduction of these fractures.,CD001705
"Background Alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose or miglitol, have the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The true value of these agents, especially in relation to diabetes related mortality and morbidity, has never been investigated in a systematic literature review and meta‐analysis. Objectives To assess the effects of alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Search methods We searched  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, reference lists of reviews on the topic of alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors and we contacted experts and manufacturers for additional trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks duration comparing alpha‐glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with any other intervention and that included at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycemic control, lipids, insulin levels, body weight, adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers read all abstracts, assessed quality and extracted data independently. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by the judgement of a third reviewer. A statistician checked all extracted data entrance in the database. We attempted to contact all authors for data clarification. Main results We included 41 trials (8130 participants), 30 investigated acarbose, seven miglitol, one trial voglibose and three trials compared different alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors. Study duration was 24 weeks in most cases and only two studies lasted amply longer than one year. We found only few data on mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Acarbose had a clear effect on glycemic control compared to placebo: glycated haemoglobin ‐0.8% (95% confidence interval ‐0.9 to ‐0.7), fasting blood glucose ‐1.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐1.4 to ‐0.9), post‐load blood glucose ‐2.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐2.7 to ‐1.9). The effect on glycated haemoglobin by acarbose was not dose‐dependent. We found a decreasing effect on post‐load insulin and no clinically relevant effects on lipids or body weight. Adverse effects were mostly of gastro‐intestinal origin and dose dependent. Compared to sulphonylurea, acarbose decreased fasting and post‐load insulin levels by ‐24.8 pmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐43.3 to ‐6.3) and ‐133.2 pmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐184.5 to ‐81.8) respectively and acarbose caused more adverse effects. Authors' conclusions It remains unclear whether alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors influence mortality or morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conversely, they have a significant effect on glycemic control and insulin levels, but no statistically significant effect on lipids and body weight. These effects are less sure when alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors are used for a longer duration. Acarbose dosages higher than 50 mg TID offer no additional effect on glycated hemoglobin but more adverse effects instead. Compared to sulphonylurea, alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors lower fasting and post‐load insulin levels and have an inferior profile regarding glycemic control and adverse effects.","Alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus Alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors may be used for patients with type 2 diabetes. They delay the absorbance of carbohydrates ('complex form of sugar') in the gut. In this review we present data from meta‐analyses that show (among other things) a decrease in glycated haemoglobin, fasting and post‐load blood glucose and post‐load insulin. But we found no evidence for an effect on mortality or morbidity. We found clues that with higher dosages the effect on glycated haemoglobin, in contrast to post‐load blood glucose, remains the same. This might be because a lower compliance due to increasing side‐effects.",CD003639
"Background Obesity is closely related to type 2 diabetes and long‐term weight reduction is an important part of the care delivered to obese persons with diabetes. Objectives To assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes. Search methods Computerized searches were performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and other electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of reference lists and selected journals. Selection criteria Randomized, controlled trials were included where pharmacotherapy was used as the primary strategy for weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes. Published and unpublished literature in any language and with any study design was included. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers abstracted data and the quality of included studies was evaluated by assessing potential attrition, as well as selection and measurement bias, and a Jadad score was obtained. Effects were combined using a random effects model. Main results A sufficient number of studies were available for a quantitative synthesis for fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine. Twenty two randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxitine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. Pharmacotherapy produced modest reductions in weight for fluoxetine (5.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 ‐ 6.9) at 24 to 26 weeks follow up; orlistat 2.0 kg (CI, 1.3 ‐ 2.8) at 12 to 57 weeks follow‐up, and sibutramine 5.1 kg (CI, 3.2 ‐ 7.0) at 12 to 52 weeks follow‐up. Glycated hemoglobin also modestly and significantly reduced for fluoxetine and orlistat. Gastrointestinal side effects were common with orlistat; tremor, somnolence and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine. Some studies, using a variety of study designs, were available on other drugs and a significant decrease in weight was noted in three studies of mazindol, one of phenmetrazine, two of phentermine. No studies were identified that fit inclusion criteria for pseudoephedrine, ephedra, sertraline, yohimbine, amphetamine or its derivatives, bupropion, topiramate, benzocaine, threachlorocitric acid, sertraline, and bromocriptine. Authors' conclusions Fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine can achieve statistically significant weight loss over 12 to 57 weeks. The magnitude of weight loss is modest, however, and the long‐term health benefits remain unclear. The safety of sibutramine is uncertain. There is a paucity of data on other drugs for weight loss or control in persons with type 2 diabetes.","Pharmacotherapy for weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus Obesity is closely related to type 2 diabetes and weight reduction is an important part of the care delivered to obese persons with diabetes. This review of drugs for weight loss among adults with type 2 diabetes revealed weight loss of between 2.0 and 5.1 kg for fluoxetine, orlistat and sibutramine at follow‐up of up to 57 weeks. The long‐term effects remain uncertain. Adverse events were common in all three drugs: gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat; tremor, somnolence, and sweating with fluoxetine; and palpitations with sibutramine. There were few studies examining other drugs used for weight loss in populations with diabetes.",CD004096
"Background Little is known about the effectiveness of strategies to enable people to achieve and maintain recommended levels of physical activity. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity in adults aged 16 years and older, not living in an institution. Search methods We searched  The Cochrane Library ( issue 1 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, BIDS ISI, SPORTDISCUS, SIGLE, SCISEARCH (from earliest dates available to December 2004). Reference lists of relevant articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared different interventions to encourage sedentary adults not living in an institution to become physically active. Studies required a minimum of six months follow up from the start of the intervention to the collection of final data and either used an intention‐to‐treat analysis or, failing that, had no more than 20% loss to follow up. Data collection and analysis At least two reviewers independently assessed each study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous measures of self‐reported physical activity and cardio‐respiratory fitness. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Main results The effect of interventions on self‐reported physical activity (19 studies; 7598 participants) was positive and moderate (pooled SMD random effects model 0.28 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) as was the effect of interventions (11 studies; 2195 participants) on cardio‐respiratory fitness (pooled SMD random effects model 0.52 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90). There was significant heterogeneity in the reported effects as well as heterogeneity in characteristics of the interventions. The heterogeneity in reported effects was reduced in higher quality studies, when physical activity was self‐directed with some professional guidance and when there was on‐going professional support. Authors' conclusions Our review suggests that physical activity interventions have a moderate effect on self‐reported physical activity, on achieving a predetermined level of physical activity and cardio‐respiratory fitness. Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions. Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions.",Interventions for promoting physical activity Not taking enough physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases including coronary heart disease. Regular physical activity can reduce this risk and also provide other physical and possibly mental health benefits. The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels. The findings of this review indicate that professional advice and guidance with continued support can encourage people to be more physically active in the short to mid‐term. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long‐term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active.,CD003180
"Background Although epidural analgesia provides the most effective labour analgesia, it is associated with some adverse obstetric consequences, including an increased risk of instrumental delivery. Many centres discontinue epidural analgesia late in labour to improve a woman's ability to push and reduce the rate of instrumental delivery. Objectives To assess the impact of discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour on:   i) rates of instrumental deliveries and other delivery outcomes; and   ii) analgesia and satisfaction with labour care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (October 2007). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of epidurals discontinued late in labour compared with continuation of the same epidural protocol until birth, in women who receive an epidural for analgesia in the first stage of labour. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality and extracted the data. We analysed categorical data using relative risk (RR), and continuous data using weighted mean difference. Main results We identified six studies, of which five were included (462 participants). Three of these were high‐quality studies whilst the other two were judged to be of lower quality because placebo was not used and the method of randomisation not described. All studies used different epidural analgesia protocols (type of drug, dosage or method of administration). Overall, the reduction in instrumental delivery rate was not statistically significant (23% versus 28%, RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.15) nor was there any statistically significant difference in rates of other delivery outcomes. The only statistically significant result was an increase in inadequate pain relief when the epidural was stopped (22% versus 6%, RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.99 to 6.80). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that discontinuing epidural analgesia late in labour reduces the rate of instrumental delivery. There is evidence that it increases the rate of inadequate pain relief in the second stage of labour. The practice of discontinuing epidurals is widespread and the size of the reduction in instrumental delivery rate could be clinically important; therefore, we recommend a larger study than those included in this review be undertaken to determine whether this effect is real or has occurred by chance, and to provide stronger evidence about the safety aspects.","Discontinuation of epidural analgesia late in labour for reducing the adverse delivery outcomes associated with epidural analgesia Not enough evidence to suggest that stopping an epidural late in labour lowers the risk of instrumental delivery or other unwanted outcomes. Epidurals are used for pain relief in labour, but they increase the risk of instrumental delivery (vacuum/forceps). Stopping epidurals early aims to allow women to feel the pushing urge and so reduce the chance of having an instrumental birth and possible problems associated with such a birth. There is not enough evidence from the five included trials, involving 462 participants, to show whether stopping an epidural really does lower the risk of instrumental delivery or of any other unwanted outcome. The results show that women whose epidural is stopped report more pain than women whose epidural is continued until the birth of the baby. More research is needed.",CD004457
"Background Alcohol consumption has been linked with injuries through motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fires and burns, and violence. In the US, half of the estimated 100,000 deaths attributed to alcohol each year are due to intentional and unintentional injuries. The identification of effective interventions for the reduction of unintentional and intentional injuries due to problem drinking is, therefore, an important public health goal. Objectives To assess the effect of interventions for problem drinking on subsequent injury risk. Search methods We searched 12 twelve computerized databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1982 to 2002), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2002, Issue 2), PsycINFO (1967 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to10/96), ERIC (1966 to12/96), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to11/96), IBSS (1961 to 2002), ISTP (1982 to 2002) and three specialized transportation databases (Transport 1988 to 2002/03). Bibliographies of relevant trials were searched and authors were contacted. Government agencies were also contacted for further information and grey literature. Most of the electronic and bibliographic database searches were last run in May 2002. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of interventions among participants with problem drinking, which are intended to reduce alcohol consumption or to prevent injuries or their antecedents, and which measured injury‐related outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data on participants, interventions, follow‐up, allocation concealment, and outcomes, and independently rated allocation concealment quality. Main results Of 23 eligible trials identified, 22 had been completed and 17 provided results for relevant outcomes. Completed trials comparing interventions for problem drinking to no intervention reported reduced motor‐vehicle crashes and related injuries, falls, suicide attempts, domestic violence, assaults and child abuse, alcohol‐related injuries and injury emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Reductions ranged from 27% to 65%. Because few trials were sufficiently large to assess effects on injuries, individual effect estimates were generally imprecise. We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions, patient populations, and outcomes were so diverse. The most commonly evaluated intervention was brief counseling in the clinical setting. This was studied in seven trials, in which injury‐related deaths were reduced: relative risk (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.00. However, this reduction may have been due to chance. The majority of trials of brief counseling also showed beneficial effects on diverse non‐fatal injury outcomes. Authors' conclusions Interventions for problem drinking appear to reduce injuries and their antecedents (e.g. falls, motor vehicle crashes, suicide attempts). Because injuries account for much of the morbidity and mortality from problem drinking, larger studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of treating problem drinking on injuries.","Action with problem drinkers can cut risk of injury Drinking too much alcohol can be dangerous, and injuries (both intentional and unintentional) are one of the most important ways in which excess alcohol use can result in harm. Are there ways of working with people known to be ""problem drinkers"" that can reduce the number of these injuries? The reviewers found 17 studies of programs that reported whether working with problem drinkers reduced injuries. Several different approaches were evaluated, the most common being brief counseling by health workers. The evidence from these studies suggests that action with problem drinkers is effective in reducing both injuries and events that lead to injury (such as falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicide attempts). However, more research is needed to calculate the level of effectiveness accurately and to determine which type of program works best.",CD001857
"Background Paediatric studies have demonstrated that cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a decline in thyroid hormone levels. Adult patients who undergo open heart surgery and receive triiodothyronine supplementation have demonstrated a dose‐dependent increase in cardiac output which has been associated with an improved clinical outcome. Thyroid hormone supplementation in infants may also reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality. Objectives To determine if perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation or replacement in infants undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass improves postoperative and longer term morbidity and mortality. Search methods The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 ‐ October 2007), EMBASE (1980 ‐ October 2007), CINAHL (1982 ‐ October 2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching in the English language. Selection criteria All trials using random allocation to perioperative thyroid hormone therapy (supplementation or replacement) compared to control (placebo or no therapy) in infants (birth to one year of age) undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Thyroid hormone therapy must be triiodothyronine. Data collection and analysis Primary clinical outcomes included measures of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used in the assessment of trial quality. Treatment effects were expressed using relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD). Main results Three small studies were identified that tested perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation or replacement in infants aged less than one year undergoing cardiac surgery (Mackie 2005; Portman 2000; Chowdhury 2001). In the Chowdhury 2001 study, a subgroup of nine neonates was eligible for this review. No deaths occurred during the studies. Chowdhury 2001 and Mackie 2005 found no significant effect of perioperative thyroid hormone supplementation in neonates on either length of hospital stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. Portman 2000 found no significant difference in dopamine requirements for the treatment versus control groups for the first 24 hours postoperatively and in Mackie 2005 for up to five days, while in the Chowdhury neonatal subgroup, inotrope requirements were significantly lower in the treatment group. Portman 2000 reported significant differences between the two groups at one and 24 hours postoperatively for free T3 and at one hour postoperatively for total T3 levels. Total T4 levels showed no significant difference between groups, either pre‐cardiopulmonary bypass or up to 72 hours postoperatively. In Mackie 2005, total and free T3 levels were significantly higher in the T3 group at 24, 48 and 72 postoperative hours but were similar between groups immediately before and after CPB and at seven postoperative days. The study drug was ceased 33 hours prematurely in one subject in Mackie 2005 due to a seven minute episode of ectopic atrial tachycardia. Authors' conclusions At present, there is a lack of evidence concerning the effects of triiodothyronine supplementation in infants undergoing cardiac surgery. Further randomised controlled trials which include sufficiently large subject numbers in a variety of different age strata (neonates, infants and older children) need to be undertaken.","Thyroid hormone supplementation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in infants undergoing cardiac surgery There is insufficient evidence to advocate the use of triiodothyronine supplementation for the prevention of postoperative morbidity and mortality in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.Thyroid hormones are integral in cellular metabolism and haemodynamic stability. A transient acquired hypothyroidism occurs after cardiopulmonary bypass and is thought to be associated with low cardiac output, left ventricular dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and impaired ventilatory drives. Thyroid hormone supplementation has been postulated as a possible therapeutic option to improve postoperative outcome measures. This review highlights the lack of evidence concerning the benefits and harms of triiodothyronine supplementation in infants who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass.",CD004220
"Background Early‐onset group B streptococcal disease (EOGBSD) is the most frequent cause of serious infection in the newborn period. Current strategies used to prevent EOGBSD are focused upon maternal antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce transmission of GBS to the infant. Observational studies have suggested that the administration of intramuscular penicillin to the newborn immediately following delivery may be an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of EOGBSD. Objectives To determine if the administration of intramuscular penicillin to newborns at birth is a safe and effective method to prevent morbidity and mortality from EOGBSD. Search methods The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of electronic databases: Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), and MEDLINE (1966 ‐ Dec 2003); and previous reviews including cross references, expert informants and journal hand searching in the English language as well as conference and symposia proceedings published in Pediatric Research. Selection criteria Randomised trials in which intramuscular penicillin was administered as prophylaxis for EOGBSD within four hours of birth. Outcomes considered were EOGBSD, neonatal mortality, late‐onset GBSD, neonatal sepsis, and other secondary outcomes such as neurodevelopmental status and length of hospital stay. Data collection and analysis The search for and assessment of trials for inclusion, quality assessment and data extraction were undertaken independently by the reviewers. Meta‐analysis was not undertaken as data from only one trial is included in this review. Data were analysed using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results One randomised controlled trial was included in this review. In this trial of 1187 infants of birthweight 501 to 2000 grams, there were no significant differences found for the outcomes of EOGBSD (RR 0.73; 95%CI 0.32, 1.62), or neonatal mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.55, 1.11). No other outcomes were able to be assessed. Authors' conclusions This review does not support the routine use of intramuscular penicillin to prevent EOGBSD in newborn infants. There is a discrepancy between this finding and the results of a number of larger non‐randomised trials. Explanations for this are proposed. There is a need for this intervention to be tested as a component of the existing prevention strategies in widespread use.","Intramuscular penicillin for the prevention of early onset group B streptococcal infection in newborn infants Not enough evidence to know whether giving antibiotics as a routine to new born babies reduces group B streptococcus infection in the first week of life. Group‐B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common bacteria which can be passed from the mother to the newborn and can lead to infection in the first week of life (neonatal Early Onset Group‐B Streptococcal Disease or EOGBSD). Although rare, (approximately one per thousand births) it is the most common cause of serious infection in newborn babies. Currently, usual management to reduce the risk of infection is to give antibiotics to women at increased risk in labour and to observe the newborn baby closely for signs of infection. Giving an injection of penicillin immediately after birth to newborn babies routinely has been proposed as another way of preventing infection. This review included only one trial and does not have enough data to show whether treating the newborn with intramuscular penicillin should be used to prevent infection in newborn babies. Good quality trials are needed.",CD003667
"Background Regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthesia) for caesarean section is the preferred option when balancing risks and benefits to the mother and her fetus. Spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section is thought to be advantageous due to simplicity of technique, rapid administration and onset of anaesthesia, reduced risk of systemic toxicity and increased density of spinal anaesthetic block. Objectives To assess the relative efficacy and side‐effects of spinal versus epidural anaesthesia in women having caesarean section. Search methods The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (February 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003). Selection criteria Types of studies considered for review include all published randomised controlled trials involving a comparison of spinal with epidural anaesthesia for caesarean section. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion. Review Manager software was used for calculation of the treatment effect represented by relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) using a random effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Ten trials (751 women) met our inclusion criteria. No difference was found between spinal and epidural techniques with regards to failure rate (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.24; four studies), need for additional intraoperative analgesia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32; five studies), need for conversion to general anaesthesia intraoperatively, maternal satisfaction, need for postoperative pain relief and neonatal intervention. Women receiving spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section showed reduced time from start of the anaesthetic to start of the operation (WMD 7.91 minutes less (95% CI ‐11.59 to ‐4.23; four studies), but increased need for treatment of hypotension RR 1.23 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.51; six studies). Authors' conclusions Both spinal and epidural techniques are shown to provide effective anaesthesia for caesarean section. Both techniques are associated with moderate degrees of maternal satisfaction. Spinal anaesthesia has a shorter onset time, but treatment for hypotension is more likely if spinal anaesthesia is used. No conclusions can be drawn about intraoperative side‐effects and postoperative complications because they were of low incidence and/or not reported.","Spinal versus epidural anaesthesia for caesarean section Effective regional anaesthesia for caesarean section can be achieved by both spinal or epidural techniques. Compared to epidural, spinal anaesthesia allows surgery to begin earlier, but increases the need to treat hypotension. There was no difference shown with respect to failure rate, need for additional intraoperative analgesia, conversion to general anaesthesia intraoperatively, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal intervention. Differences in side‐effects such as post dural puncture headache, nausea and vomiting, and postoperative complications needing anaesthetic intervention were inconclusive due to the small numbers reported. No studies reported breastfeeding ability and time to ambulation post surgery.",CD003765
"Background Inotropes are widely used in preterm infants to treat cardiovascular compromise, which may result from early adaptive problems of the transitional circulation, perinatal asphyxia or sepsis. Sustained hypotension and poor organ blood flow are associated with brain injury including peri/intraventricular haemorrhage and subsequent poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Adrenaline (epinephrine) infusions are used in preterm infants with clinical cardiovascular compromise. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of adrenaline compared to no treatment or other inotropes in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise. Search methods Randomised controlled trials were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966‐August 2003), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003) and EMBASE (1980 ‐ 2003), supplemented with searches of reference lists of published trials and abstracts of conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of preterm newborn infants that compared adrenaline to no treatment or other inotropic agents (including dopamine, dobutamine, noradrenaline or isoprenaline). Data collection and analysis Data were extracted and analysed independently by two reviewers. Treatment effects on the following outcomes were to be determined: mortality in the newborn period, long term neurodevelopmental outcomes, radiological evidence of brain injury, short term haemodynamic changes, adverse drug effects and short term neonatal outcomes. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Studies were analysed for methodological quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results One ongoing study (Pellicer 2003) was identified. One study comparing adrenaline with dopamine infusion was included but was published in abstract form only (Phillipos 1996). It enrolled hypotensive, predominately preterm infants in the first 24 hours. Only infants >1750g are included in this review (report for infants <=1750g appears incomplete). The study was reported as being randomised and double blinded, but methods were not reported. Both adrenaline and dopamine significantly increased heart rate and mean BP, with no statistically significant effect on left or right ventricular outputs. No other clinical outcomes were reported. No studies were identified that compared adrenaline to other inotropes, placebo or no treatment. Authors' conclusions There are insufficient data on the use of adrenaline infusions in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise to make recommendations for practice. There is a need for larger trials to determine whether adrenaline is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise.","Adrenaline for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise Not enough evidence from trials on the use of adrenaline (epinephrine) for preterm babies with poor heart rates and circulation. Sustained poor blood flow in preterm babies can lead to complications, including impaired development.

Adrenaline (epinephrine) is another inotrope drug that can be used. The review found that there is not enough evidence from trials to show the effects of adrenaline on preterm babies with poor circulation, and more research is needed.",CD003958
"Background Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15 to 20% of five‐year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. Objectives To assess the effects of complex behavioural and educational interventions on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare them with other interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 20 March 2008) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of complex behavioural or educational interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children were included, except those focused solely on daytime wetting. Comparison interventions included no treatment, simple and physical behavioural methods, alarms, desmopressin, tricyclic antidepressants, and miscellaneous other interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Main results Eighteen trials involving 1174 children were identified which included a complex or educational intervention for nocturnal enuresis. The trials were mostly small and some had methodological problems including the use of a quasi‐randomised method of concealment of allocation in three trials and baseline differences between the groups in another three. A complex intervention (such as dry bed training (DBT) or full spectrum home training (FSHT)) including an alarm was better than no‐treatment control groups (for example the relative risk (RR) for failure or relapse after stopping DBT was 0.25; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.39) but there was not enough evidence about the effects of complex interventions alone if an alarm was not used. A complex intervention on its own was not as good as an alarm on its own or the intervention supplemented by an alarm (e.g. RR for failure or relapse after DBT alone versus DBT plus alarm was 2.81; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.38). On the other hand, a complex intervention supplemented by a bed alarm might reduce the relapse rate compared with the alarm on its own (e.g. RR for failure or relapse after DBT plus alarm versus alarm alone was 0.5; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.80). There was not enough evidence to judge whether providing educational information about enuresis was effective, irrespective of method of delivery. There was some evidence that direct contact between families and therapists enhanced the effect of a complex intervention, and that increased contact and support enhanced a package of simple behavioural interventions, but these were addressed only in single trials and the results would need to be confirmed by further randomised controlled trials, in particular the effect on use of resources. Authors' conclusions Although DBT and FSHT were better than no treatment when used in combination with an alarm, there was insufficient evidence to support their use without an alarm. An alarm on its own was also better than DBT on its own, but there was some evidence that combining an alarm with DBT was better than an alarm on its own, suggesting that DBT may augment the effect of an alarm. There was also some evidence that direct contact with a therapist might enhance the effects of an intervention.","Complex behavioural and educational interventions for bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) in children Night‐time bedwetting is common in childhood, and can cause stigma, stress and inconvenience. Bed alarms are the treatments which currently appear to work best in the long term. Complex interventions such as dry bed training can also be tried. This involves, as well as using an alarm to wake the child after he or she has wet the bed, getting them to go to the toilet repeatedly and changing their own sheets. The review found 18 trials in 1174 children who had received this sort of training or another treatment. Although an alarm on its own was better than the dry bed training on its own, there was some evidence that using them together might reduce the relapse rate after stopping alarm treatment, and without the adverse effects of drug treatment. However, both using an alarm and dry bed training needs time and effort from the child and family. There was not enough research comparing complex interventions with other techniques.",CD004668
"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients short survival time, high mortality and generally rapid decline raise the importance of early treatment. Current guidelines suggest a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants as ""gold standard"" for IPF treatment, although the evidence for this recommendation is weak. Based on animal models, it has been hypothesized a central role for aberrant wound healing following repeated epithelial lung injury, weakening the rationale for using corticosteroids in IPF, previously thought to be a chronic inflammatory disease. Objectives The aim of the review is to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of adults with familial and sporadic IPF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2008) and EMBASE (January 1985 to June 2008) and reference lists of articles. We searched reference lists of published articles to identify clinical trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) using corticosteroids alone for the treatment of adults with IPF. Data collection and analysis Abstracts of identified articles were retrieved and articles possibly fulfilling inclusion criteria were retrieved in full. Two reviewers would have independently assessed trial quality if there had been any included study. Main results Seventeen articles were selected as potentially eligible for meta‐analysis. After further analysis of full text papers, no RCTs or CCTs were identified as suitable and therefore no data was available for inclusion in any meta‐analysis. All studies were excluded due to inadequate methodologies. Authors' conclusions At present, there is no evidence for an effect of corticosteroid treatment in patients with IPF. On the other hand, other fibrotic lung diseases, such as non‐specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), are reported to show a better response to corticosteroids. Making a clear distinction between IPF and other entities grouped under the umbrella term  interstitial lung disease  is, therefore, essential as this may have therapeutic and prognostic implications.","Currently there is no evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids alone in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disorder of unknown cause that is progressive and leads to death. Existing evidence about the treatment of IPF is difficult to interpret because of evolving diagnostic criteria and classification schemes, grouping together diverse entities with markedly different natural histories and responses to therapy. Therefore, because the old studies did not include only IPF patients, their results cannot be extended to IPF as they are currently defined. In addition, methodologic problems mainly related to the lack of randomized placebo‐controlled treatment trials have made evidence‐based conclusions difficult. A systematic search for high quality placebo‐controlled randomised trials comparing corticosteroid treatment with placebo in subjects with a diagnosis of IPF was unable to identify any studies suitable for inclusion in the review.",CD002880
"Background It is thought that approximately 6% of children have speech and language difficulties of which the majority will not have any other significant developmental difficulties. Whilst most children's difficulties resolve, children whose difficulties persist into primary school may have long‐term problems concerning literacy, socialisation, behaviour and school attainment. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of speech and language interventions for children with primary speech and language delay/disorder. Search methods The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, CENTRAL: 2002/3), CINAHL (1982 ‐ July 2002), EMBASE (1980 ‐ Sept Week 4 2002), ERIC (1965 ‐ 2002), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ Sept Week 3 2002), PsycINFO (1872 ‐ 2002/10 Week 2), The National Research Register (2002/3). In addition to this references were taken from reviews of the literature and reference lists from articles. Selection criteria The review considered randomised controlled trials of speech and language therapy interventions for children or adolescents with primary speech and language delay/disorder. Data collection and analysis Titles and abstracts were identified and assessed for relevance, before the full text version was obtained of all potentially relevant articles. The data were categorised depending on the nature of the control group and considered in terms of the effects of intervention on expressive and receptive phonology, syntax and vocabulary. The outcomes used in the analysis were dependent on the focus of the study with only the primary effects of therapy being considered in this review. Main results The results of twenty‐five studies were used in the meta‐analysis. The results suggest that speech and language therapy is effective for children with phonological (SMD=0.44, 95%CI: 0.01,0.86) or vocabulary difficulties (SMD=0.89, 95%CI: 0.21,1.56), but that there is less evidence that interventions are effective for children with receptive difficulties (SMD=‐0.04, 95%CI: ‐0.64,0.56). Mixed findings were found concerning the effectiveness of expressive syntax interventions (n=233; SMD=1.02, 95%CI: 0.04‐2.01). No significant differences were shown between clinician administered intervention and intervention implemented by trained parents, and studies did not show a difference between the effects of group and individual interventions (SMD=0.01, 95%CI: ‐0.26,1.17). The use of normal language peers in therapy was shown to have a positive effect on therapy outcome (SMD=2.29, 95%CI: 1.11,3.48). Authors' conclusions The review shows that overall there is a positive effect of speech and language therapy interventions for children with expressive phonological and expressive vocabulary difficulties. The evidence for expressive syntax difficulties is more mixed, and there is a need for further research to investigate intervention for receptive language difficulties. There is a large degree of heterogeneity in the results, and the sources of this need to be investigated.","Speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay or disorder Primary speech and language delay/disorder is a common developmental difficulty which, if unresolved, can cause difficulties of both learning and socialisation lasting into adolescence and beyond. This review examines the effectiveness of speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay/disorder.The review concludes that whilst there may be some support for the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for children with expressive phonological and expressive vocabulary difficulties, the evidence concerning the effectiveness of interventions for expressive syntax is mixed, and no evidence is available concerning interventions for children with receptive language difficulties.",CD004110
"Background The prevention and early treatment of infections are the mainstay of the medical management of the majority of people with HIV infection, who live in low income countries without access to antiretroviral drugs. Cotrimoxazole is cheap and effective against a wide range of organisms. However, routine prophylactic treatment is difficult to deliver in low‐resource settings, and could also lead to increased resistance to the drug. Objectives To assess the effects of routinely administered cotrimoxazole on death and illness episodes in HIV infected adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, LILACS, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS and AIDSDRUGS databases, and proceedings and abstracts from AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) conferences (search date July 2001). We checked reference lists for trials and other pertinent articles, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi randomised trials comparing routinely administered cotrimoxazole versus placebo or no treatment in adults (age greater than 13 years). Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Where data were incomplete or unclear trial authors were contacted for further details. Main results Four trials involving 1476 people were identified. Three trials (1416 people) studied heterosexual men and women in West Africa. A fourth trial was of homosexual men on chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma, in the United States. Meta‐analysis of the three African trials showed a significant beneficial effect of cotrimoxazole for death: relative risk 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.87); for morbid events: 0.76 (0.64 to 0.9); and for hospitalisation: 0.66 (0.48 to 0.92). There was no significantly greater risk of adverse effects: relative risk 1.28 (0.47 to 3.51). Effects were similar in people with early and advanced HIV disease. Insufficient evidence was found on effects in areas with higher bacterial resistance or in people on antiretroviral therapy. Authors' conclusions In the trials included in the review, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis had a beneficial effect in preventing death and illness episodes in adults with both early and advanced HIV disease. However, the wider applicability of these findings is unclear, in particular to areas with higher background bacterial resistance to cotrimoxazole. Further trials would be required in differing settings to widen applicability.","A daily low dose of cotrimoxazole for preventing opportunistic infections in adults with HIV Cotrimoxazole helps to prevent infections in adults who are HIV‐infected but may increase resistance to the drug and more trials are needed. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system, leaving people vulnerable to infections. Such infections often cause death or serious complications. Anti‐viral drugs can slow HIV. However, most HIV‐infected people live in developing countries without access to these treatments. Preventing infections is therefore the main aim of HIV treatment in developing countries. A daily low dose of cotrimoxazole , an antibiotic (a drug that fights bacterial infections), is used to try to prevent infections and improve survival, but with unknown effectiveness for HIV‐infected people. The review found cotrimoxazole improved survival in some areas of Africa and found improvements in other outcomes, but adverse effects and possible drug resistance are unclear. More trials are needed.",CD003108
"Background Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs for neck and shoulder pain require substantial staff and financial resources. Despite questionable scientific evidence of their effectiveness, they are widely used. Neck and shoulder complaints are common among working age adults and they are often associated with physical work load and stress. Pain in the neck and shoulder area cause biopsychosocial difficulties for the patient, especially if disability due to pain is prolonged. To help patients with biopsychosocial problems, or to prevent their development, multidisciplinary biopsychosocial programs are used for rehabilitation for patients with neck and shoulder pain. Nevertheless, multidisciplinary treatment programmes are often laborious and rather long processes and require good collaboration between the patient, the rehabilitation team and the work place. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults. Search methods The reviewed studies for this review were electronically identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, Medic, the Science Citation Index, reference checking and consulting experts in the rehabilitation field. The original search was planned and performed for more broad area of musculoskeletal disorders. Trials on neck and shoulder pain were separated afterwards. The literature search was updated in November 2002 by electronically searching MEDLINE and EMBASE. Selection criteria From all references identified in our original search, we selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation for working age adults suffering from neck and shoulder pain. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary, i.e., it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus either a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these. Data collection and analysis Four authors blinded to journal and author selected the trials that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies for actual clinical use. Two other authors blinded to journal and author extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies, using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation. Main results After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only two relevant studies that satisfied our criteria. No more studies were found for this update. One of the studies was considered to be a methodologically low quality RCT and the other one was a methodologically low quality CCT. The clinical relevance of included studies was satisfactory. There was limited scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain. Authors' conclusions We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation compared with other rehabilitation facilities for neck and shoulder pain. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic neck and shoulder complaints, therefore we see an urgent need for high quality trials in this field.","Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for neck and shoulder pain among working age adults. There is not enough evidence to show whether or not multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs are helpful for people with neck and shoulder pain. Prolonged neck and shoulder pain can lead to a combination of physical, psychological and social difficulties. For that reason, physical rehabilitation can also include psychological, behavioural and educational interventions. This kind of ""multidisciplinary rehabilitation"" is available in some pain clinics, and rehabilitation centres and clinics. The review of trials found there was not enough good evidence to show whether or not multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation is beneficial to adults of working age with neck and shoulder pain.",CD002194
"Background The cervical cap and the diaphragm are vaginal barrier contraceptive methods that prevent pregnancy by covering the cervix. The two devices also act as a reservoir for spermicide. The cervical cap is smaller and can remain in place longer than the diaphragm. The Prentif cap and the FemCap have been compared to the diaphragm in randomized controlled trials. Objectives To compare the contraceptive efficacy, safety, discontinuation, and acceptability of the cervical cap with that of the diaphragm. Search methods In February 2012, we searched MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, and LILACS for randomized controlled trials of cervical caps. In addition, we searched for recent clinical trials through ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Previous searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we wrote to manufacturers and investigators for information about other published or unpublished trials. Selection criteria All randomized controlled trials in any language comparing a cervical cap with a diaphragm were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Articles identified for inclusion were independently abstracted by two reviewers. Data were entered into RevMan, and a second reviewer verified the data entered. Outcome measures include contraceptive efficacy, safety, discontinuation, and acceptability. Outcomes were calculated as Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Life‐table and Kaplan‐Meier cumulative rate ratios for selected measures are presented. Main results The curves for the life‐table cumulative pregnancy rates for the Prentif cap and the diaphragm did not differ. However, the Kaplan‐Meier six‐month cumulative pregnancy rates for the FemCap and the diaphragm were not clinically equivalent. The Prentif cap had more Class I to Class III cervical cytologic conversions than the diaphragm (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.04 to 5.11). The FemCap trial did not find differences in Papanicolaou smear results between the groups. Fewer Prentif cap users had vaginal ulcerations or lacerations (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.71) than diaphragm users. Fewer FemCap users had blood in the device (OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.14), but more had urinary tract infections (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.95). In the FemCap trial, similar proportions of women reported liking their device. However, FemCap users were less likely to use the device alone after the trial (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71) or recommend it to a friend (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81). Authors' conclusions The Prentif cap was as effective as its comparison diaphragm in preventing pregnancy, but the FemCap was not. Both cervical caps appear to be medically safe.","Cervical cap versus diaphragm for birth control The cervical cap and the diaphragm are small, rubber devices that women put in their vagina (birth canal) and place over their cervix. Both devices block sperm and help prevent pregnancy. Also, both hold a chemical that kills sperm. Birth control with these methods can be stopped at any time and can be used without involving the partner. The cervical cap is smaller than the diaphragm and can be left in place longer. The cervical cap can be worn up to 72 hours, and the diaphragm can be used up to 30 hours. In this review, we compared the cervical cap with the diaphragm for how well it worked for birth control. We also looked at its safety and whether women stopped using it early. In February 2012, we did a computer search for studies of cervical caps. We wrote to manufacturers and researchers for information about other trials. We included randomized controlled trials that compared a cervical cap with a diaphragm. We found two trials that compared the cervical cap with the diaphragm. Two types of cervical caps were studied: the Prentif cap and the FemCap. The Prentif cap prevented pregnancy as well as the diaphragm, but the FemCap did not. Women who used the Prentif cap had more abnormal changes in the cervix than diaphragm users. The FemCap users did not have more abnormal changes than the diaphragm users. Many women from both groups dropped out early from the two trials. Similar numbers of FemCap users and diaphragm users reported liking their assigned method. The Prentif cap worked as well as the diaphragm to prevent pregnancy. The FemCap did not prevent pregnancy as well as the diaphragm. Both cervical caps appear to be medically safe.",CD003551
"Background Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease mediated by auto‐antibodies most often directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Less than five per cent of patients have auto‐antibodies to a muscle tyrosine kinase. Patients would be expected to benefit from plasma exchange. Objectives To examine the efficacy of plasma exchange in the short‐ and long‐term treatment of myasthenia gravis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (31 January 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (31 January 2011, Issue 1 2011 in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) using the term 'myasthenia gravis'. We checked the bibliographies of trial reports and contacted one author for additional data. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs including all patients with generalised myasthenia gravis. We considered treatment trials of plasma exchange alone or combined with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. The primary outcome measures were:(1) for exacerbation: change in a specific muscle score;(2) for chronic myasthenia gravis: change in a functional scale. Data collection and analysis One author extracted and a second checked the data. Main results We identified four RCTs with 148 participants in total. In the first one, of 14 participants with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis, improvement after one month was not significantly greater for participants treated with plasma exchange and prednisone than for those treated with prednisone alone. A randomised controlled cross‐over trial of 12 participants with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulins after four weeks. A trial including 87 participants with myasthenia gravis exacerbation found no statistically significant difference between plasma exchange and immunoglobulin after two weeks. The fourth RCT, with 35 participants, showed a statistically significant difference in favour of plasma exchange before thymectomy. However these trials, except the third, are at high risk of bias and have a weak statistical power. Authors' conclusions No adequate RCTs have been performed to determine whether plasma exchange improves the short‐ or long‐term outcome for chronic myasthenia gravis or myasthenia gravis exacerbation. However, many studies with case series report short‐term benefit from plasma exchange in myasthenia gravis, especially in myasthenic crisis. In severe exacerbations of myasthenia gravis one RCT did not show a significant difference between plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin. Further research is need to compare plasma exchange with alternative short‐term treatments for myasthenic crisis or before thymectomy and to determine the value of long‐term plasma exchange for treating myasthenia gravis.","Plasma exchange for generalised myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is caused by antibodies in the blood which attack the junctions between nerves and muscles they stimulate. Plasma exchange removes these circulating auto‐antibodies. Many case series suggest that plasma exchange helps to treat myasthenia gravis. Four randomised controlled trials were identified. In the first one, of 14 participants with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis, the myasthenic muscular score after one month was not significantly different for participants treated with plasma exchange and prednisone than for those treated with prednisone alone but there can be only low statistical confidence in the results of this study because of its small size. A randomised controlled cross‐over trial of only 12 participants reported the same efficacy, after four weeks, of plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulins for the treatment of moderate to severe myasthenia gravis, but because of bias and a very weak statistical power the data prevent any conclusion. The third, including 87 participants, showed the same efficacy, after two weeks, of plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulins for the treatment of myasthenia gravis exacerbation. The fourth randomised controlled trial involving 35 participants reported a benefit from plasma exchange before thymectomy but this trial was heavily biased. No trial addressed the new subtype with antibodies to a muscle specific kinase. Further research is needed to determine the value of long‐term plasma exchange for treating myasthenia gravis and to compare plasma exchange with alternative short‐term treatments for myasthenic crisis or before thymectomy in both types of autoimmune myasthenia.",CD002275
"Background Snoezelen, multi‐sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils. The rationale for this lies in the proposition that the provision of a sensory environment for people with dementia places fewer demands on their intellectual abilities but capitalizes on their residual sensorimotor abilities. The clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make the examination of the therapeutic values of snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions. Objectives To examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen (or multisensory stimulation) for older people with dementia and their caregivers. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 23 March 2008 using the terms: snoezelen OR ""multi‐sensory*"". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. The reviewers hand‐searched PubMed and the ISI Web of Science. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials in which snoezelen or multi‐sensory programmes was used as an intervention for older people suffering from any forms of dementia. Data collection and analysis The two reviewers independently reviewed and assessed the quality of the trials. Main results Two new trials were included in this update. Baker 2003 was an expanded study of Baker 2001 reported in the previous version. Both Baker 2003 and van Weert 2005 examined the short‐term and longer‐term effects of snoezelen on behaviour, mood, and communication of people with moderate to severe dementia. The format of implementation was different in the two trials: one was session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003), whilst the other was a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005). Owing to the differences in study methodology, the results of the two trials were not pooled for analysis. The session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003) did not show any effects on behaviour, mood, cognition and communication / interaction in the short term (during or immediately after sessions) or longer term (at post‐intervention or 1‐month post‐intervention follow‐up). Likewise, the 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005) failed to demonstrate any significant short‐term and longer term effects on behaviour, mood and interaction. Authors' conclusions A more vigorous review methodology was adopted in this update. The study of Kragt 1997, reported in the previous version, was excluded because the snoezelen programme only consisted of three sessions, which was considered too brief for a therapeutic intervention. Two new trials were reviewed. Meta‐analyses could not be performed because of the limited number of trials and different study methods of the available trials. Overall, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of snoezelen for dementia. There is a need for more reliable and sound research‐based evidence to inform and justify the use of snoezelen in dementia care.","No evidence of the efficacy of snoezelen or multi‐sensory stimulation programmes for people with dementia Snoezelen (or multi‐sensory stimulation) has become a commonly used intervention to manage maladaptive behaviours and to promote positive mood of older people with dementia. Originally, two randomised clinical trials were available for this review. Some short‐term benefits were documented in promoting adaptive behaviours in people with dementia during and immediately after their participation in the sessions. In this update, two new trials were included and revealed two different forms of applying snoezelen to dementia care. One is a session‐based snoezelen programme while the other is a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care programme. Both trials did not show any significant effects on behaviour, interaction, and mood of people with dementia.",CD003152
"Background Intraamniotic infection is associated with maternal morbidity and neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and death. Although antibiotic treatment is accepted as the standard of care, few studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens for this infection and whether to administer antibiotics intrapartum or postpartum. Objectives To study the effects of different maternal antibiotic regimens for intraamniotic infection on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2002) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 30 April 2010 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria Trials where there was a randomized comparison of different antibiotic regimens to treat women with a diagnosis of intraamniotic infection were included. The primary outcome was perinatal morbidity. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from each publication independently by the authors. Main results Two eligible trials (181 women) were included in this review. No trials were identified that compared antibiotic treatment with no treatment. Intrapartum treatment with antibiotics for intraamniotic infection was associated with a reduction in neonatal sepsis (relative risk (RR) 0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00, 1.44) and pneumonia (RR 0.15; CI 0.01, 2.92) compared with treatment given immediately postpartum, but these results did not reach statistical significance (number of women studied = 45). There was no difference in the incidence of maternal bacteremia (RR 2.19; CI 0.25, 19.48). There was no difference in the outcomes of neonatal sepsis (RR 2.16; CI 0.20, 23.21) or neonatal death (RR 0.72; CI 0.12, 4.16) between a regimen with and without anaerobic activity (number of women studied = 133). There was a trend towards a decrease in the incidence of post‐partum endometritis in women who received treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone, but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.54; CI 0.19, 1.49). Authors' conclusions The conclusions that can be drawn from this meta‐analysis are limited due to the small number of studies. For none of the outcomes was a statistically significant difference seen between the different interventions. Current consensus is for the intrapartum administration of antibiotics when the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is made; however, the results of this review neither support nor refute this although there was a trend towards improved neonatal outcomes when antibiotics were administered intrapartum. No recommendations can be made on the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen to choose to treat intraamniotic infection. [Note: The six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]","Antibiotic regimens for management of intraamniotic infection Antibiotics are used to prevent life‐threatening complications for mother and baby when the amniotic fluid is infected, but it is not known which antibiotic is best. Amniotic fluid is the 'water' surrounding the baby inside the womb. If this fluid becomes infected, it can be life‐threatening for the mother and baby, and the baby should be born within 12 hours. Infection can come from bacteria entering the womb from the vagina, or from a medical procedure that penetrates the membranes ('bag' around baby and waters). Antibiotics reduce the risk of dangerous complications for both mother and baby. The review found there is not enough evidence from trials to show which antibiotic is best or whether it should be given before or after the baby is born.",CD003254
"Background Oral (anti‐oestrogens) and injectable (gonadotrophins) ovulation induction agents have been used to increase the number of eggs produced by a woman per cycle in treatment for unexplained subfertility. It is unclear whether there are significant advantages of one type of treatment over the other in this context or in terms of fertility. Objectives To assess the efficacy of oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents for unexplained subfertility. Search methods The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group was used for the identification of relevant randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria All trials where oral ovulation induction agents were compared with injectable ovulation induction agents in treatment groups generated by randomisation, from couples with unexplained subfertility, were considered for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Five randomised controlled trials, including a total of 231 identified couples with unexplained subfertility, were found and included in this review. All trials were assessed for quality criteria. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage, multiple birth, occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and cycle cancellation. Main results Where trials with important co‐interventions were excluded, there was no significant difference in the odds of beneficial outcomes for oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents ‐ live birth per couple (OR 0.06, 95%CI 0.00 to 1.15), pregnancy per woman (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.09 to 1.20); nor of detrimental outcomes for injectable versus oral agents ‐ miscarriage (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.00 to 2.84); there were no reported cases of multiple births, cases of ovarian hyperstimulation or discontinued cycles consequent upon overstimulation. Where trials with the co‐intervention of a human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger injection (given only in the injectable ovulation induction agent treatment arm) were not excluded there was no significant difference in the odds of live birth per couple (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.15 to1.08). However oral ovulation induction agents had significantly reduced odds of pregnancy per woman compared to injectable ovulation induction agents (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.80). For detrimental outcomes, there were no significant differences in the odds of miscarriage (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.09 to 4.01) and multiple birth (OR 1.08, 95%CI 0.16 to 7.03) for injectable versus oral agents. No data were available concerning the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome nor cycle cancellation. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to suggest that oral agents are inferior or superior to injectable agents in the treatment of unexplained subfertility. Information on harms is sketchy, and remains compatible with large differences in either direction. Much larger trials than have previously been undertaken are required to provide information on relative harms as well as benefits.","Oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents for unexplained subfertility For many couples who cannot become pregnant, no reason is apparent after investigation (unexplained infertility). One treatment option for these couples is for the woman to be given medications to increase the number of eggs she produces each cycle. This treatment is also sometimes combined with a technique of purifying the partner's sperm and injecting it through the woman's cervix at her fertile time. This review of trials looked at which type of these medications, oral‐form or injection‐form, were the best in producing the most successful outcome. The review found no significant benefit of using one type of medication (oral or injectable) over the other, although there were insufficient data from trials. More research is needed to examine this question.",CD003052
"Background Epinephrine is a cardiac stimulant with complex effects on the heart and blood vessels. It has been used for decades in all age groups to treat cardiac arrest and bradycardia. Despite formal guidelines for the use of epinephrine in neonatal resuscitation, the evidence for these recommendations has not yet been rigorously scrutinised. While it is understood that this evidence is in large part derived from animal models and the adult human population, the contribution from work in the neonatal population remains unclear. In particular, it remains to be determined if any randomised studies in neonates have helped to establish if the administration of epinephrine in the context of apparent stillbirth or extreme bradycardia might influence mortality and morbidity. Objectives To determine the effect of administration of epinephrine to apparently stillborn and extremely bradycardic newborns on mortality and morbidity. Secondary objectives included analysis of the effect of intravenous versus endotracheal administration epinephrine and high dose versus standard dose epinephrine on mortality and morbidity. Search methods Searches were made of Medline from 1966 to August 2007, CINAHL (from 1982), Current Contents (from 1988), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007). Bibliographies of conference proceedings were reviewed and unpublished studies were sought by hand searching the conference proceedings of the Society for Pediatric Research and the European Society for Pediatric Research from 1993 to 2007. This search was updated in November 2010. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of newborns, both pre‐term and term, receiving epinephrine for unexpected apparent stillbirth or extreme bradycardia. Data collection and analysis No studies were found meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review Main results No studies were found meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review. Authors' conclusions No randomised, controlled trials evaluating the administration of epinephrine to the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn infant were found. Similarly, no randomised, controlled trials that addressed the issues of optimum dosage and route of administration of epinephrine were found. Current recommendations for the use of epinephrine in newborn infants are based only on evidence derived from animal models and the human adult literature. Randomised trials in neonates are urgently required to determine the role of epinephrine in this population.","Epinephrine for the resuscitation of apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn infants There are no trials investigating the effects of epinephrine to try to revive babies who appear to be stillborn or close to death at birth. Some babies are born with a very slow heart beat (extreme bradycardia) or their hearts have stopped beating shortly before birth (apparent stillbirth). Although they may appear to be close to death, it may be possible to revive these babies. Epinephrine is a drug that stimulates the heart and has been used to treat cardiac arrest and bradycardia in people of all ages. However, the review found no trials of the use of epinephrine for reviving newborn babies with extreme bradycardia or whose hearts appear to have just stopped beating. Research is needed into the effects of epinephrine on newborns.",CD003849
"Background Traditional Chinese herbal medicines have been used for a long time to treat diabetes, and many controlled trials have been done to investigate their efficacy. Objectives To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases:  The Cochrane Library  (CENTRAL), the Chinese BioMedical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, combined with hand searches on Chinese journals and conference proceedings. No language restriction was used. Selection criteria Randomised trials of herbal medicines (with at least two months treatment duration) compared with placebo, pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and drop‐out rates. Meta‐analyses were performed where data were available. Main results Sixty‐six randomised trials, involving 8302 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was generally low. Sixty‐nine different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, which compared herbal medicines with placebo, hypoglycaemic drugs, or herbal medicines plus hypoglycaemic drugs.     Compared with placebo,  Holy basil leaves ,  Xianzhen Pian ,  Qidan Tongmai , traditional Chinese formulae (TCT),  Huoxue Jiangtang Pingzhi , and  Inolter  showed significantly hypoglycaemic response. Compared with hypoglycaemic drugs including glibenclamide, tolbutamide, or gliclazide, seven herbal medicines demonstrated a significant better metabolic control, including  Bushen Jiangtang Tang, Composite Trichosanthis, Jiangtang Kang, Ketang Ling, Shenqi Jiangtang Yin, Xiaoke Tang , and  Yishen Huoxue Tiaogan . In 29 trials that evaluated herbal medicines combined with hypoglycaemic drugs, 15 different herbal preparations showed additional better effects than hypoglycaemic drugs monotherapy. Two herbal therapies combined with diet and behaviour change showed better hypoglycaemic effects than diet and behaviour change alone. No serious adverse effects from the herbal medicines were reported. Authors' conclusions Some herbal medicines show hypoglycaemic effect sin type 2 diabetes. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted due to the low methodological quality, small sample size, and limited number of trials. In the light of some positive findings, some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high‐quality trials.","Chinese herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes mellitus We are still waiting for firm evidence on Chinese herbal medicines for treatment of non‐insulin‐dependent diabetes. Although the use of herbal medicines for treatment of diabetes has a long history especially in the East, current evidence cannot warrant to support the routine use in clinical practice. This systematic review evaluates the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with type 2 diabetes. The review shows that some herbal medicines lower blood sugar and relieving symptoms in patients with diabetes. However, the methodological quality of the clinical trials evaluating these herbs is generally poor. The analyses also indicate that trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. However, the trials did not report significant adverse effects. In conclusion, herbal medicines should not be recommended for routine use in diabetic patients of type 2 diabetes until we get scientifically sound trials. Testing the herbs in larger, well‐designed trials is needed in order to establish the necessary evidence for their use.",CD003642
"Background Jet lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day‐night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re‐align them with the outside world. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet lag after air travel across several time zones. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration. An updating search was carried out on 12/2/2008 but no new studies were identified. Selection criteria Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet lag or related components, such as subjective well being, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms. Data collection and analysis Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment.   Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database. Main results Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet‐lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow‐release melatonin suggests that a short‐lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) is 2, based on the only two trials that gave the necessary data. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin. Authors' conclusions Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short‐term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2‐4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation.","Melatonin for the prevention and treatment of jet lag Jet lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones.

"Background Wheeze is a common symptom in infancy and is a common cause for both primary care consultations and hospital admission. Beta2‐adrenoceptor agonists (b2‐agonists) are the most frequently used as bronchodilator but their efficacy is questionable. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of b2‐agonist for the treatment of infants with recurrent and persistent wheeze. Search methods We identified relevant trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised register composed of records identified in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and PUBMED. We used the following terms to search the database: Wheeze or asthma and Infant or Child and Short acting beta‐agonist or Salbutamol (variants), Albuterol, Terbutaline (variants), Orciprenaline, Fenoterol. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of b2‐agonist against placebo in children under two years of age who had two or more previous episodes of wheeze, not related to another form of chronic lung disease. Data collection and analysis Eight studies met the criteria for inclusion in this meta‐analysis. The studies investigated patients in three settings: at home (three studies), in hospital (two studies) and in the pulmonary function laboratory (three studies). The main outcome measure was change in respiratory rate except for community based studies where symptom scores were used. Main results The studies were markedly heterogeneous and between study comparisons were limited. Improvement in respiratory rate, symptom score and oxygen saturation were noted in one study in the emergency department following two salbutamol nebulisers but this had no impact on hospital admission. There was a reduction in bronchial reactivity following salbutamol. There was no significant benefit from taking regular inhaled salbutamol on symptom scores recorded at home. Authors' conclusions There is no clear benefit of using b2‐agonists in the management of recurrent wheeze in the first two years of life although there is conflicting evidence. At present, further studies should only be performed if the patient group can be clearly defined and there is a suitable outcome parameter capable of measuring a response.","Short acting beta2‐agonists for recurrent wheeze in children under two years of age Beta‐agonists such as salbutamol are the most frequently prescribed reliever medication for asthma. They work well in adults and children but their effectiveness in infants is less clear. Eight trials were reviewed involving 229 patients in four different settings. Although infants have the capability to respond to salbutamol, there is only limited relief of acute symptoms when given to acutely ill patients. This did not impact on requirement for hospital admission or length of hospital stay. Regular salbutamol has not been shown to offer protection against developing symptoms.",CD002873
"Background Eating disorders represent an extremely difficult, time‐consuming and costly condition to treat. Being young, female, and dieting are some of the few identified risk factors that have been reliably linked to the development of eating disorders. There is currently limited evidence in the published literature to suggest that any particular type of program is effective in preventing eating disorders and there has been concern that some interventions have the potential to cause harm. Objectives To determine if eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents are effective in: (1) promoting healthy eating attitudes and behaviours; (2) promoting protective psychological factors; (3) promoting satisfactory physical health; (4) having a long‐term, sustainable, and positive impact on mental and physical health; and, (5) ensuring safety in relation to possible harmful consequences on mental or physical health. Search methods Relevant trials are identified through searching the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR) and relevant biomedical and social science databases, as well as reference lists from articles identified through the search strategy and contact with experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a major focus on eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents, where there is no known DSM‐IV diagnosis of an eating disorder, are eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials must include a control group and at least one objective outcome measure (e.g., BMI) or a standardised psychological measure used with the intervention and control group, pre‐ and post‐intervention. Data collection and analysis A total of 1016 titles have been identified through the search to date. Twenty‐two studies were located that reported use of a randomised controlled trial methodology and were critically appraised by two independent reviewers. Twelve studies met the selection criteria outlined above. Main results Combined data from two eating disorder prevention programs based on a media literacy and advocacy approach indicate a reduction in the internalisation or acceptance of societal ideals relating to appearance at a 3‐ to 6‐month follow‐up (Kusel 1999; Neumark* 2000) [SMD ‐0.28, ‐0.51 to ‐0.05, 95% CI]. There is insufficient evidence to support the effect of five programs designed to address eating attitudes and behaviours and other adolescent issues in the general community or those classified as being at high risk for eating disorder (Buddeberg* 1998; Dalle Grave 2001; Killen 1993; Santonastaso 1999; Zanetti 1999) and insufficient evidence to support the effect of two programs designed to improve self‐esteem (O'Dea 2000; Wade 2003). Data from two didactic eating disorder awareness programs could not be pooled for analysis. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that harm resulted from any of the prevention programs included in the review. Authors' conclusions The one significant pooled effect in the current review does not allow for any firm conclusions to be made about the impact of prevention programs for eating disorders in children and adolescents, although none of the pooled comparisons indicated evidence of harm. The meta‐analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials.","Preventing eating disorders in children and adolescents Eating disorders represent an extremely difficult, time‐consuming and costly condition to treat.

The Cochrane Library and mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV: an umbrella review. Evidence‐based Child Health: A Cochrane Review Journal 2007;2:4‐24. ==================================== At the end of 1998 over 33 million people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and over one million children had been infected from their mothers. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess what interventions may be effective in decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection as well as their effect on neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidity. Search methods The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing any intervention aimed at decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection compared with placebo or no treatment, or any two or more interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection. Data collection and analysis Trial quality assessments and data extraction were undertaken by the reviewer. Main results Zidovudine   Four trials comparing zidovudine with placebo involving 1585 participants were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission with any zidovudine (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42‐0.69). There is no evidence that 'long course therapy' is superior to 'short course therapy'. Nevirapine   One trial compared intrapartum and postnatal nevirapine with intrapartum and postnatal zidovudine in 626 women, the majority of whom breast fed their infants. Compared with zidovudine, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV with nevirapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40‐0.83). No trials are available comparing nevirapine with placebo. Caesarean section   One trial comparing elective caesarean section with anticipation of vaginal delivery involving 436 participants was included. Compared with vaginal delivery, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection with caesarean section (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05‐0.55). Immunoglobulin   One trial comparing hyperimmune immunoglobulin plus zidovudine with non‐specific immunoglobulin plus zidovudine involving 501 participants was included. The addition of hyperimmune immunoglobulin to zidovudine does not appear to have any additional effect on the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.29‐1.55). Authors' conclusions Zidovudine, nevirapine and delivery by elective caesarean section appear to be very effective in decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection.","Interventions for reducing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection PLEASE NOTE: This review should be considered obsolete and outdated.

"Background Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis mediates closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal side effects after indomethacin administration. Because furosemide increases prostaglandin production, it could potentially help prevent indomethacin‐related toxicity, but also decrease ductal response to indomethacin. Objectives The primary objectives of this review were to assess (1) whether furosemide affects the incidence of failure of ductal closure after indomethacin and that of indomethacin‐related toxicity and (2) the effect of furosemide on mid‐term and long‐term outcome. The secondary objective was to determine whether the effect of furosemide on renal function and water balance depends on prior extracellular volume (assessed by blood urea nitrogen [BUN]/creatinine ratio). Search methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) and selected abstract books, without language restriction were searched. For the latest update, database searches were done on April 1, 2007 and Issue 1, 2007 of The Cochrane Library. Selection criteria Studies with (1) random allocation to either indomethacin alone or indomethacin and furosemide and (2) analysis of either short‐term risk‐benefit ratio of furosemide, mid‐ or long‐term outcome, or the relationship between extracellular volume at study entry and changes in renal function were selected. Data collection and analysis Studies were assessed for possible bias and for quality of assessment of ductal patency. Categorical variables were assessed using relative risk and absolute risk reduction. The effects of furosemide on renal function and fluid balance were assessed by comparing changes from baseline in the treatment group with those in controls. Subsets were determined a priori based on BUN/creatinine ratio at study entry. Main results All three studies fulfilling the entry criteria had limitations, including possible or definite bias. There was substantial heterogeneity among studies.   Furosemide administration did not significantly increase the risk of failure of ductal closure; however, sample size was insufficient to rule out even a 31% increase. In the subset with initial BUN/creatinine ratio > 20 mg/mg, two of 18 patients receiving furosemide could not complete a three‐dose course of indomethacin because of toxicity. Minimal or no information was available about any of the other main outcome variables. Furosemide increased urine output regardless of the initial BUN/creatinine ratio, leading to a 5% weight loss during a three‐dose course, an undesired effect in patients with initial BUN/creatinine ratio > 20 mg/mg. Furosemide increased creatinine clearance only in patients with initial BUN/creatinine ratio < 20 mg/mg. Authors' conclusions There is not enough evidence to support the administration of furosemide to premature infants treated with indomethacin for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. Furosemide appears to be contraindicated in the presence of dehydration in those infants.","Furosemide for prevention of morbidity in indomethacin‐treated infants with patent ductus arteriosus There is no strong evidence of benefit from routine use furosemide, a loop diuretic, in preterm babies receiving indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus. A blood vessel (ductus arteriosus), which is required for blood circulation for the fetus in the womb, closes soon after birth in babies born around the expected date of delivery (term infants). Babies born early (preterm) may develop symptoms if they do not close that blood vessel after birth. Preterm infants who have symptoms due to the ductus arteriosus may receive therapy (indomethacin) for closing that vessel. Indomethacin may decrease kidney function and the amount of urine. Furosemide, a medication which reduces body water (diuretic), might help limit the effects of indomethacin on the kidney. This review analyzed the effects of furosemide on preterm babies receiving indomethacin to close the ductus arteriosus. The review of trials found not enough evidence to recommend routine use of furosemide in preterm infants who receive indomethacin for closing a ductus arteriosus.",CD001148
"Background Intraventricular hemorrhage remains a serious complication of premature birth and post‐hemorrhagic hydrocephalus still has no satisfactory treatment. Acetazolamide and furosemide, which both reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid, have been suggested as non‐invasive therapies to reduce hydrocephalus and the need for ventriculo‐peritoneal (V‐P) shunting. Objectives To determine the effect of acetazolamide and furosemide on shunt dependence and other complications in infants developing post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Search methods Searches were performed of electronic databases (MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1974 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library). PubMed was searched on April 18, 2007 and Issue 2, 2007 of The Cochrane Library was searched. Selection criteria Randomised, or quasi‐randomised trials, of acetazolamide and/or furosemide compared with standard therapy in infants with IVH or post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed by the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD), a fixed effect model and sensitivity analyses where appropriate. Main results There were two eligible trials: one randomized 16 infants and the other 177 infants. Neither study showed a decreased risk for V‐P shunt or for V‐P shunt or death associated with acetazolamide and furosemide therapy. The larger trial showed that acetazolamide and furosemide treatment resulted in a borderline increase in the risk for motor impairment at one year (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 ‐ 1.58; RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 ‐ 0.31), but did not significantly affect the risk for the combined outcome of delay, disability or motor impairment among survivors, or the risk of the combined outcome of death, delay, disability or impairment at one year. The larger trial showed that diuretic treatment increased the risk for nephrocalcinosis (RR 5.31, 95% CI 1.90 ‐ 14.84; RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 ‐ 0.29); meta‐analysis confirmed this result. Authors' conclusions Acetazolamide and furosemide therapy is neither effective nor safe in treating post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Acetazolamide and furosemide cannot be recommended as therapy for post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.","Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Bleeding (hemorrhage) into the fluid‐producing cavities (ventricles) of the brain is a serious complication of premature birth. Large hemorrhages may result in fluid building up under pressure, progressively enlarging the brain and head. Current treatment approaches, including the insertion of a valve drainage system (shunt) are fraught with problems. Acetazolamide and furosemide, two drugs with diuretic action, reduce the production of fluid in the ventricles of the brain and have been proposed as safe treatments to treat dilatation of the ventricles after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants. When compared with standard treatment, diuretic therapy was found not to reduce the need for shunt surgery. Diuretic drugs are neither safe nor effective in treating ventricular dilatation in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage.",CD002270
"Background Relaxin is a protein hormone composed of two amino acid chains. The role played by relaxin in human pregnancy and parturition is unclear. Its use and involvement as a cervical ripening agent has been debated since the 1950s. Because the main source of human relaxin is the corpus luteum of pregnancy much of the early work on induction of labour has focused on porcine or bovine preparations. With the advent of DNA recombinant technology human relaxin has become available for evaluation. Relaxin is thought to have a promoting effect on cervical ripening. Due to a possible inhibitory effect on human myometrial activity, relaxin may not be associated with the concomitant increase in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation seen with other induction agents. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using a standardised methodology. Objectives To determine the effects of relaxin (purified porcine and recombinant human) for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of induction. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2003) and bibliographies of relevant papers. We updated this search on 13 August 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria Clinical trials comparing relaxin used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. Data collection and analysis A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two‐stage method of data extraction. Main results Nine studies were considered; five have been excluded and four included examining a total of 267 women. There were no reported cases of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes in any of the studies. There was no evidence of a difference between the rate of caesarean section in those women given relaxin compared with placebo (15.3% versus 14.2%; relative risk (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.50, 4 trials, 257 women). There was a reduction in the risk of the cervix remaining unfavourable or unchanged with induction with relaxin (21.9% versus 49.3%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.72, 3 trials, 371 women). There were no reported cases of uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes. Authors' conclusions The place of relaxin, either purified porcine or recombinant human, as an induction or cervical priming agent is unclear. Further trials are needed to estimate the true effect of relaxin within current clinical practice. [Note: The three citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]",Relaxin for cervical ripening and induction of labour Not enough evidence that relaxin helps ripen the cervix and induce labour. Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the placenta in the final stages of pregnancy to ripen the neck of the uterus (cervix) and prepare it for labour. It is used to induce labour and is either made from genetically combined human relaxin or from animal preparations. The role of relaxin treatment remains unclear but it is possible that it may relax the muscle tissue of the uterus and therefore not work as well as other methods of induction. The review of trials found there was not enough research to show the true effect of relaxin. More research is needed.,CD003103
"Background Inhaled short acting beta2 adrenergic agonists and ipratropium bromide are both used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Compare the efficacy of short‐acting beta‐2 agonists and ipratropium. Search methods A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD trials register was carried out using the terms: bronchodilator* OR albuterol OR metaproterenol OR terbutaline OR isoetharine OR pirbuterol OR salbutamol OR beta‐2 agonist. Selection criteria All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. Data collection and analysis All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Trials were combined using Review Manager using a fixed effects model. The size of the treatment effects were tested for heterogeneity. Main results We identified no placebo‐controlled comparisons of beta‐2 agonists. Three studies permitted comparison of ipratropium to an inhaled beta‐2 agonist. These studies included a total of 103 patients. The beta2‐agonists used were: fenoterol and metaproterenol. One study was a parallel group trial of regular therapy for seven days. The other two were cross over studies of single dose treatments, with efficacy measured 90 min post dose. There was no washout period between treatments. Both treatments produced an improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) after 90 min in the range 150‐250 ml. The was no difference between treatments, mean difference in FEV1 10 ml; 95% CI ‐220, 230 ml. In one small crossover study (n=10) there was a significant improvement in arterial PaO2 after 30 minutes with ipratropium (+5.8 mm Hg ± 3.0 (SEM)) compared to metaproterenol (‐6.2 ± 1.2 mm Hg), but this was not significant at 90 min. There were no data concerning respiratory symptoms. The crossover studies showed no evidence of an additive effect of the two treatments, although they were not designed specifically to test this. An update search conducted in February 2002 yielded one further excluded study. Authors' conclusions There are few controlled trial data concerning the use of inhaled beta2‐agonist agents in acute exacerbations of COPD and none that have compared these agents directly with placebo. None of the studies used the more modern beta2‐agonists used most widely in this setting (salbutamol and terbutaline). Beta2‐agonists and ipratropium both produce small improvements in FEV1, but beta2‐agonists may worsen PaO2 for a period. We could not draw conclusions concerning possible additive effects.","Inhaled short‐acting beta2‐agonists versus ipratropium for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease During an acute worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there may be a worsening in airway function. Two different types of drugs may be given as inhaled therapy to improve this: anticholinergic drugs such as ipratropium and beta2‐agonists. These days the drugs of the latter type that are used for acute COPD are salbutamol and terbutaline, but neither of these drugs have been used in the only studies that we could find. We found only three small studies. Overall, both types of drug showed a small but worthwhile effect. There was no difference between them. Our review was not designed to test whether they would have had a greater effect if both were given at the same time.",CD002984
"Background Shoulder pain after stroke is common and disabling. The optimal management is uncertain, but electrical stimulation (ES) is often used to treat and prevent pain. Objectives To determine the efficacy of any form of surface ES in the prevention and/or treatment of pain around the shoulder at any time after stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Review Group trials register and undertook further searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Contact was established with equipment manufacturers and centres that have published on the topic of ES. Selection criteria We considered all randomised trials that assessed any surface ES technique (functional electrical stimulation (FES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or other), applied at any time since stroke for the purpose of prevention or treatment of shoulder pain. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Main results Four trials (a total of 170 subjects) fitted the inclusion criteria. Study design and ES technique varied considerably, often precluding the combination of studies. Population numbers were small. There was no significant change in pain incidence (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.64; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.14) or change in pain intensity (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.13; 95% CI ‐1.0 to 1.25) after ES treatment compared to control. There was a significant treatment effect in favour of ES for improvement in pain‐free range of passive humeral lateral rotation (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 9.17; 95% CI 1.43 to 16.91). In these studies ES reduced the severity of glenohumeral subluxation (SMD ‐1.13; 95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.60), but there was no significant effect on upper limb motor recovery (SMD 0.24; 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.62) or upper limb spasticity (WMD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.37). There did not appear to be any negative effects of electrical stimulation at the shoulder. Authors' conclusions The evidence from randomised controlled trials so far does not confirm or refute that ES around the shoulder after stroke influences reports of pain, but there do appear to be benefits for passive humeral lateral rotation. A possible mechanism is through the reduction of glenohumeral subluxation. Further studies are required.","Electrical stimulation for preventing and treating post‐stroke shoulder pain Electrical stimulation of muscles improves shoulder stiffness after a stroke but there is not enough evidence to prove whether it reduces shoulder pain. Patients who have a stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds) often develop shoulder pain. This adds to the difficulties caused by the stroke. Pain in the shoulder can cause weakness, loss of muscle tone and loss of feeling. Electrical neuromuscular stimulation (ES) is done by applying an electrical current to the skin. This stimulates nerves and muscle fibres and may improve muscle tone, muscle strength, and reduce pain. The review found that shoulder stiffness improved after ES. No adverse effects were noted. The review also found there was not enough evidence to decide if ES can reduce shoulder pain or not. More research is needed.",CD001698
"Background Using a pilot system we have categorised this review as: Current question ‐ update pending (See ""Published notes"" section for an explanation). Traveller's diarrhoea is a syndrome frequently encountered in persons crossing an international boundary. Diarrhoea can lead to significant discomfort and interference with travel plans. Bacterial pathogens are a frequent cause of this syndrome. Several antibiotics have been tested for efficacy in reducing the duration and severity of the illness. Objectives The aims of this review were to assess the effects of antibiotics on traveller's diarrhoea in relation to duration of illness, severity of illness, and adverse effects of medications. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched. Additional trials were identified by hand searching. Content experts were contacted. Selection criteria All trials in any language in which travellers older than 5 years were randomly allocated to treatment for acute non‐bloody diarrhoea with antibiotics and where the causative organism is not known at allocation. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Twenty published studies met inclusion and quality criteria for inclusion. Twelve studies were placebo‐controlled. A meta‐analysis for the primary outcome was not feasible. All of the 10 trials reported a significant reduction in duration of diarrhoea in participants treated with antibiotics compared with placebo. Data from two trials demonstrated a small reduction for antibiotic treated patients in the number of unformed stools passed per each 24 hour period from randomisation up to 72 hours. Data from six trials demonstrated a greater number of participants being cured of diarrhoea by 72 hours (odds ratio 5.90, 95% confidence interval 4.06 to 8.57). Data regarding side effects were available from five trials. There was wide variation in the prevalence of side effects reported in different trials. Persons taking antibiotics experienced more side effects than those taking placebo (odds ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 3.75). Authors' conclusions Antibiotic treatment is associated with shorter duration of diarrhoea but higher incidence of side‐effects. Trials generally do not report duration of post‐treatment diarrhoea using time‐to‐event analyses, and should do. 8 May 2019 No update planned Other Many trials of antibiotics in travellers' diarrhoea have been conducted and demonstrate shorter illness following antibiotic treatment. Travellers' diarrhoea is a self‐limiting illness. Therefore an update is not a current priority for the CIDG.","Antibiotic treatment reduces duration and severity of travellers' diarrhoea. Using a pilot system we have categorised this review as: Current question ‐ update pending. (See ""Published notes"" section for an explanation). Diarrhoea is a common problem for travellers, particularly travellers going from developed to less developed nations. The illness is frequently caused by a bacterial infection. Although the illness is unlikely to result in death, diarrhoea can disrupt travel plans and lead to severe or incapacitating symptoms. The review showed that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of diarrhoea. Persons taking antibiotics reported more side effects, but most side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.",CD002242
"Background Symptomatic benign prostatic obstruction is a common problem for older men. The gold standard treatment, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), significantly improves urinary symptoms and urinary flow. However, TURP has up to a 20% morbidity. Currently, there are a number of minimally invasive procedures that may be safe, effective alternatives to TURP. One promising surgical technique is laser prostatectomy. Objectives To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of laser prostatectomy techniques for treating men with symptomatic benign prostatic obstruction. Search methods Randomized controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Collaboration Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies of retrieved articles and reviews, and contacting expert relevant trialists and laser manufacturers. Selection criteria All randomized controlled trials evaluating laser prostatectomy treatment for men with symptomatic BPH. Trials were eligible if they (1) were randomized comparisons of a laser technique with TURP, (2) included at least 10 men with BPO in each treatment arm, (3) provided at least 6‐months follow‐up, and (4) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales or urodynamic measurements. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and assessment of methodologic quality was performed independently by two reviewers. Information on study design, subject and treatment characteristics, adverse events, urinary symptoms, and urinary flow were extracted using a standard form. Main results Twenty studies involving 1898 subjects were evaluated, including 4 studies with multiple comparisons. We found eight comparisons of TURP with contact lasers, eight with non‐contact lasers, four with hybrid techniques, and one with interstitial laser coagulation (ILC). Two studies compared transurethral electrovaporization (TUVP) with contact lasers, one study compared interstitial laser coagulation with transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), and one study compared holmium contact lasers (HoLRP) with open prostatectomy. Among the studies comparing laser prostatectomy with TURP, follow‐up duration ranged from 6 to 36 months. Mean age (67.2 yrs), mean baseline symptom score (20.2), and mean baseline peak urinary flow (9.2 mL/s) did not differ by treatment group. The pooled percentage improvements for mean urinary symptoms ranged from 59% to 68% with lasers and 63% to 77% with TURP. The improvements for mean peak urinary flow ranged from 56% to 119% with lasers and 96% to 127% with TURP. Overall, laser subjects were less likely to receive transfusions or develop strictures and their hospitalizations were shorter. Non‐contact laser subjects were more likely to have dysuria, urinary tract infection, and retention. Re‐operation occurred more often following laser procedures. Authors' conclusions Laser techniques are a useful alternative to TURP for treating BPO. Small sample sizes and differences in study design limit any definitive conclusions regarding the preferred type of laser technique. Data were insufficient to compare laser techniques with other minimally invasive procedures.","Laser prostatectomy for benign prostatic obstruction Bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) is a common problem for older men.  LUTS can be both irritative (urgency, frequency, frequent nighttime urinations) and obstructive (weak stream, hesitancy, intermittency, and feeling the bladder is not emptied).  Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is considered the gold standard treatment for symptomatic BPO.  TURP improves urinary symptoms and urinary flow by surgically removing prostatic tissue through the urethra.  However, side effects occurring in approximately 20% of all TURPs include blood loss requiring transfusion, infections, strictures, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and urinary retention.  Laser prostatectomy, which uses a laser to destroy the enlarged prostate tissue that leads to LUTS, is a minimally invasive procedure currently used as an alternative to TURP.  This review of 20 studies involving 1898 subjects found laser techniques to be useful and relatively safe alternatives to TURP.  The small number of enrolled subjects and differences in study design limit any definitive conclusions regarding which type of laser technique is the most effective.  Improvements in LUTS and urine flow slightly favored TURP, though laser procedures had fewer side effects and shorter hospitalization times.  The follow‐up durations of these studies ranged from 6 to 36 months and men with extremely large prostates were generally excluded from the trials. The risk of needing a reoperation for recurrent LUTS was higher following laser procedures. Study results were insufficient to adequately compare laser techniques with other minimally invasive procedures. More studies, using randomized treatment assignment, enrolling larger numbers of subjects, and comprehensive measures of treatment effectiveness and side events, are needed to better define the long‐term safety and durability of laser techniques for treating LUTS associated BPO.",CD001987
"Background Chronic abacterial prostatitis is a common disabling but enigmatic condition with a symptom complex of pelvic area pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. The scope of treatments recommended for chronic abacterial prostatitis is a testament to how little is known about what causes the condition and how to treat it. As a result, chronic abacterial prostatitis often causes physician frustration, patient confusion and dissatisfaction, variable thresholds for referral, and potentially inappropriate antibiotic use. Objectives Examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness of therapies for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Search methods Studies were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), the Cochrane Library, bibliographies of identified articles and reviews, and contact with an expert. Selection criteria Studies were eligible if they: (1) are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) (2) involve men with chronic abacterial prostatitis (3) control group receives placebo, sham intervention, active pharmacologic or device therapy for chronic abacterial prostatitis and (4) outcomes data are provided. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers. Data collection and analysis Study information on patients, interventions, and outcomes was extracted independently by two reviewers. The main outcome was the efficacy of treatment for chronic abacterial prostatitis versus control in improving urologic symptom scale scores or global report of urinary tract symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the prostate examination, uroflowmetry, urodynamics, analysis of urine, expressed prostatic secretions and seminal fluid, and prostate ultrasonography. Main results The 15 treatment trials involved: medications used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 4 trials); anti‐inflammatory medications (n = 2 trials); antibiotics (n = 1 trial); thermotherapy (n = 5 trials); and miscellaneous medications (n = 3 trials). The disparity between studies did not permit quantitative analysis. There were a total of 600 enrollees (age range 38 to 45). All but one of the trials were done outside the United States. Authors' conclusions The treatment trials are few, weak methodologically, and involve small sample sizes. The routine use of antibiotics and alpha blockers for chronic abacterial prostatitis is not supported by the existing evidence. The small studies examining thermal therapy appear to demonstrate benefit of clinical significance and merit further evaluation. Additional treatment trials are required and they should report important patient characteristics (e.g., race), study design details and utilize clinically relevant and validated assessment measures.","Little evidence that antibiotics or alpha‐blocker drugs help to relieve chronic abacterial prostatitis, but heat treatments might be effective and more research is needed. Chronic abacterial prostatitis (CAP) involves inflammation of the prostate gland and commonly affects men of all ages. It can cause problems urinating, including discomfort and pain, increased frequency and urge, or problems emptying the bladder. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Treatments for CAP include heat treatments (using microwaves) and several different types of drugs. The review found that there is little evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic or alpha‐blocking drugs for CAP. Heat treatments in comparison may be useful. However, the few studies that have been performed are generally of poor quality. More studies are needed.",CD002080
"Background Clinical practice guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in practice and to promote the delivery of evidence‐based health care. Objectives To identify and assess the effects of studies of the introduction of clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visiting), midwifery and other professions allied to medicine. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, MEDLINE (1975 to 1996), EMBASE, Cinahl and Sigle to 1996, the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1994 to 1996), DHSS‐Data (1983 to 1996), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (1994 to 1996) and reference lists of articles. We also hand searched the journal Quality in Health Care, made personal contact with content experts and contacted libraries identified by an expert panel. Selection criteria Randomised trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series analyses of the introduction of interventions comparing 1. Clinical guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus no guidelines; 2. Guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus guidelines plus alternative dissemination and/or implementation strategies; and 3. (post hoc) Guidelines used by professions allied to medicine versus standard physician care. The participants were nurses, midwives and other professions allied to medicine. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Main results Eighteen studies were included involving more than 467 health care professionals. The reporting of study methods was inadequate for all studies. In all but one study, nurses were the targeted professional group; one study was aimed solely at dieticians. The various behaviours targeted included the management of hypertension, low back pain and hyperlipidaemia. Nine studies were identified for comparison 1. Three out of five studies observed improvements in at least some processes of care and six out of eight studies observed improvements in outcomes of care. Only one study included a formal economic evaluation, with equivocal findings. Three studies were identified for comparison 2 but it was difficult to draw firm conclusions because of poor methods. Six studies were identified for comparison 3 (post hoc). These studies generally supported the hypothesis that there was no difference between care given by nurses using clinical guidelines and standard physician care. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that guideline‐driven care is effective in changing the process and outcome of care provided by professions allied to medicine. However, caution is needed in generalising findings to other professions and settings.","Professions allied to medicine, such as nurses, midwives and dietiticians, can effectively incorporate clinical guidelines to improve patient care The issuing of clinical guidelines to nurses, midwives, dieticians and other health‐care professionals allied to medicine may reduce variations in practice and improve patient care. This review found that, despite limited research, there is some evidence that guidelines can improve care and that professional roles can be substituted effectively, for instance a nurse can perform the function of a physician in certain circumstances. Such interventions offer the possibility of reduced costs but further research is needed in all areas of this topic.",CD000349
